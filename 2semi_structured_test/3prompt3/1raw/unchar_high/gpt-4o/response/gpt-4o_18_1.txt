To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rate (prior probability) and the likelihood of the description fitting either group.

First, let's look at the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).
- And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).

The description provided gives us information about Jason's characteristics: his age, marital status, ability, motivation, and reputation. However, it does not provide any data that specifically differentiates between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. In the absence of such differential information, the description can be considered equally likely for members of both groups.

Thus, the likelihood ratio is 1: the description fits equally well for both computer science and humanities professors.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) can be calculated as follows:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]
Since the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[
P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})
\]
Therefore, we only update the posterior using the prior probability:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
\]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.75"}}}
\]
