To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- The total number of professors: 100.
- Computer science professors: 75.
- Humanities professors: 25.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|D) \) (the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description). According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description under all professors.

Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups because the description does not include specific information about preferences or subject expertise, we consider \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

So, let's say:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = x \]

Then:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = x \times 0.75 + x \times 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = x \]

We can now substitute into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{x \times 0.75}{x} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the given description, is 0.75.
