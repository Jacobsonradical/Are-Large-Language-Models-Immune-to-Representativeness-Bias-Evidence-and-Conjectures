To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Given that Jason's description provides no specific characteristics differentiating computer science professors from humanities professors, we will rely on the prior probabilities, which are based on their relative proportions in the sample.

Let's break it down with the numbers:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability (P(Hum)) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description doesn't provide any distinguishing factors and assuming the description applies equally likely to professors from both fields, the likelihood of such a description (Jason) coming from either field's professor is the same.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's Description}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is just the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \):

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
