Given the information provided, we need to update our prior probability based on the description given using Bayes' Theorem.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: Let's denote Jason's description as \( D \). Since the description is quite general and doesn't provide specific characteristics exclusive to either field, we assume there's an equal likelihood that such a person could belong to either group. Thus:
   - \( P(D | \text{CS}) \approx P(D | \text{Humanities}) \approx 1 \)

3. **Posterior probability**: We use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \):

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Since we assumed the likelihoods are equal:

\[ P(D) \approx P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | \text{Humanities}) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, considering the general nature of the provided description and the equal likelihood assumption:

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.75"\}}
\]
