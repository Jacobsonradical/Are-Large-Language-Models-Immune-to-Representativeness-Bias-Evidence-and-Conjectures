To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The given base rates or priors for the two groups involved are:

- \(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We are given a description of Jason, but the description does not give any specific information that would allow us to discriminate clearly between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. Given the assumption that "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are equally likely descriptors for successful academics in both fields, the description does not sway the likelihood in favor of either group.

Therefore, the posterior probability is simply based on the prior probabilities:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
\]

As the description does not provide additional discriminative power, the posterior remains the same as the prior.
