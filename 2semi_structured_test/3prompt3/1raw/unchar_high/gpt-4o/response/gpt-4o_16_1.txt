To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of obtaining such a description given the fields (computer science vs. humanities).

Given:
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

**Prior Probability (P(CS)):**
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided does not contain field-specific information, so we assume the likelihood of matching Jason's profile is roughly equal across both fields.

\[ P(D \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(D \mid \text{H}) \]

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Given the above assumptions that \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(D \mid \text{H}) \), the denominator \( P(D) \) for the descriptions cancels out and we primarily weigh by the priors.

Thus:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, assuming the description does not significantly favor one field over the other, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
