To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description of his personality.

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

Here are the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) (i.e., the probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor) is the same, because nothing in the description directly points to either domain. So, we simplify to \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, given Jason's description, the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor is 0.75.
