To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): We receive the description given.

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to know the following probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**: What is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor before knowing anything specific about him?
   - Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(A) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \(P(A^c)\)**: The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (complement of \(A\)):
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)**: What is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor?
   - Assuming descriptions of individuals are equally likely and we don't have additional distinguishing information, this would presumably be uniform across both categories.

4. **Likelihood \(P(B|A^c)\)**: What is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor?
   - Similarly, this likely would also be uniform across the humanities professors if no other discriminating information is available.

Since both likelihoods (\(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A^c)\)) are implied to be equally likely given uniformity in descriptions and without additional data to bias one way or another, we can deduce the ratios are primarily influenced by the priors.

Given the prior probabilities:

- Prior for CS professors: 0.75
- Prior for Humanities professors: 0.25

Thus, the posterior probability \(P(A|B)\) just based on the priors (assuming equal likelihoods):

\[
P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
