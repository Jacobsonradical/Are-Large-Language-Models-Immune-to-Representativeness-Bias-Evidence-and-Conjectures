To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be summarized in this context as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We need to calculate these probabilities. Let's define each term:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Probability of Description Given CS \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and Probability of Description Given Humanities \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \)**:
   - Since we are given no specific information to differentiate between CS and Humanities professors based on the description, we assume that the probabilities are equal. Hence, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \).

3. **Probability of Description \( P(\text{Description}) \)**:
   - This is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the description under both groups.
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \).
   - Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(\text{Description}) \).

   Simplifying further, since we assume the description doesn't bias toward either group:
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = p \).
   - Therefore, \( P(\text{Description}) = p \times P(\text{CS}) + p \times P(\text{Humanities}) \).
   - Since \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 0.25 \):
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = p \times 0.75 + p \times 0.25 = p \).

Given all these, Bayesâ€™ Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{p \times 0.75}{p} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
