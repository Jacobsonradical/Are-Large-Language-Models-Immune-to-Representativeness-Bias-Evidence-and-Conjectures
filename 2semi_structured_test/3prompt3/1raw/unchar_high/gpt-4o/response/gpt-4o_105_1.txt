To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's set up the problem:
- The prior probability of picking a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we are not given any specific likelihoods and the description provided is fairly generic, we can assume the likelihoods \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | H) \) are reasonably similar. So, let's assume they are equal \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) = k \). 

Given Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
\]
\[
P(H | description) = \frac{P(description | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(description)}
\]

Since \( P(description) \) will cancel out when comparing the two probabilities, we can simplify to:
\[
P(CS | description) \propto P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)
\]
\[
P(H | description) \propto P(description | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given our assumption that \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) = k \):
\[
P(CS | description) \propto k \cdot 0.75
\]
\[
P(H | description) \propto k \cdot 0.25
\]

Thus:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
