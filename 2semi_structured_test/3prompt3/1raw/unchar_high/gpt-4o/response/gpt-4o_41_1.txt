To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we begin by employing Bayes' theorem. Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- 75 of those professors are in computer science.
- 25 of those professors are in the humanities.

Given these, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
And the prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description of Jason lacks any specific distinguishing characteristics that might clearly differentiate between the two fields, we can reasonably assume that the likelihood of such a description is the same for professors in both groups. In other words,
\[ P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | description) \) is:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
\]

Similarly, the posterior probability \( P(Hum | description) \) is:
\[
P(Hum | description) = \frac{P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(description)}
\]

Since \( P(description) \) is common in both posteriors and \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \),
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
\]

Substituting the prior probabilities:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
