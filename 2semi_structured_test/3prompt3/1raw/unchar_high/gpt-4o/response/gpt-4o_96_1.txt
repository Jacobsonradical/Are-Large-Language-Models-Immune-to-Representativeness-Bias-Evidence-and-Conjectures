To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- No additional specific information about the differences in personality traits between the two groups is provided.

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is from the computer science group.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is from the humanities group.
- The likelihood based on the description is assumed to be equal for both groups due to lack of differentiating information.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since the likelihood \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are assumed to be equal (denote them as \( L \)), they cancel out in the equation:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Given:
- \( P(C) \) = probability of selecting a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = probability of selecting a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Therefore:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
