To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. Let's define the necessary probabilities:

1. \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(HU)\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \(P(D|HU)\): The probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \(P(D)\): The total probability of the given description.

We want to find \(P(CS|D)\): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

### Priors

- There are 75 computer science professors, so \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \(P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

### Bayes' Theorem

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

### Total Probability (Law of Total Probability)

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]

Since we don't have explicit information about the likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|HU)\), we might assume that these probabilities are similar due to the lack of distinguishing features in the description. However, generally, Bayes' prior probability can provide us with sufficient insight, given that the population sizes are different. 

If we were to inherently assume that \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|HU)\) would be equal, the posterior should be driven by the priors. Let's compute:

### Simplifying Assumptions

Letâ€™s assume for simplicity:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|HU) \]

Therefore, \( P(D) \) simplifies to just normalizing the prior probabilities.

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HU)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Given the equal weighting of the description probability, the posterior is approximately:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
