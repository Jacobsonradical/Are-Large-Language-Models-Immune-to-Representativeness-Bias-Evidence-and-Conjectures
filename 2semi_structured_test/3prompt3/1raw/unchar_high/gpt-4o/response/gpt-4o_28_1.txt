To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Prior Probabilities**: 
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability of being a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability of being a humanities professor is \( P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess how likely it is to get the description for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, since no specific distinguishing characteristics (beyond general professional success) relative to the disciplines are given, we assume the description could equally apply to both.

    If we assume equal likelihoods, then:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | HUM) \approx 1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - According to Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) * P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     
     Since the description is equally likely for both groups, we have:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) * P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | HUM) * P(HUM)
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 1 * 0.75 + 1 * 0.25 = 1
     \]
     Then,
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
