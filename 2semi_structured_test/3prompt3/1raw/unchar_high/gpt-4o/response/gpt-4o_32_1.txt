To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Letâ€™s denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( C \) and the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( H \). We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\( N_C \)): 75
- Number of humanities professors (\( N_H \)): 25
- Total number of professors (\( N \)): 100

The prior probabilities are based on the proportion of each group in the sample:
\[ P(C) = \frac{N_C}{N} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{N_H}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description \( D \) is as likely to be observed for a computer science professor as it is for a humanities professor (which implies that the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equally probable):
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \):
\[ \frac{P(C|D)}{P(H|D)} = \frac{P(C)}{P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{1+3} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, is:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.75"}\} \]
