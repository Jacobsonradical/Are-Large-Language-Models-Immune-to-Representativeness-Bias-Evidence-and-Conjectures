To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the description given.

First, we need to know the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(A^c) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Assuming that descriptions have no inherent bias towards any field (i.e., descriptions are equally likely to be interpreted for both fields if the samples are comparable and the traits described are common among both groups), the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) can be considered equal.

Since
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

and assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), the probabilities in the numerator and denominator are proportional to the priors.

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
