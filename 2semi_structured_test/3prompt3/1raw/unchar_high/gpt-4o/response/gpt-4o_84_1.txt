To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we do that calculation:

First, letâ€™s establish the initial probabilities:
- P(CS): Probability of a professor being from computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- P(Humanities): Probability of a professor being from humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description given does not provide specific traits that are uniquely associated with either field, we can assume that the description is equally likely to apply to professors from either field (this would be P(Description | CS) and P(Description | Humanities)).

Next, we apply Bayes' Theorem to determine P(CS | Description):

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

However, in our case, since we assume P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Humanities) and remembering that P(Description) = P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) * P(Humanities), we simplify to:

Since P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Humanities),
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)} \]

Hence, this simplifies to:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Here is the formatted answer:

{"probability": "0.75"}
