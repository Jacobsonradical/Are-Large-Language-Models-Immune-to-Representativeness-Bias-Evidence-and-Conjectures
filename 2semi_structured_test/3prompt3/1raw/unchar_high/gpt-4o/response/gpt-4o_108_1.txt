To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood** (assuming that the description provided is equally likely for both groups, without additional specific information favoring one group over the other):
   - Since the description is general and could apply equally to both computer science and humanities professors, we assume the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \). For simplicity, we assume both equal 1.

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem states: \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   - Since \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \) are equal, \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be considered as the normalizing constant and does not change the relation between probabilities.

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
