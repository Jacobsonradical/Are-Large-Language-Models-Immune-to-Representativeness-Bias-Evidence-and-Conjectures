Given that Jason is part of a sample where 75 out of 100 individuals are computer science professors and 25 out of 100 individuals are humanities professors, let's update our prior belief using Bayes' Theorem, considering any given description is provided for each professor uniformly.

Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
P(Hum) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description provided does not offer any specific evidence to distinguish between a computer science professor and a humanities professorâ€”it is relatively neutral and could apply to either group. Therefore, the likelihood of receiving such a description if Jason were in either group is the same.

Given that there's no additional evidence pointing toward one group more than the other, we can assume that the likelihood of Jason's description is equal across both groups.

Therefore, our updated posterior probabilities should reflect the priors directly because the evidence does not change the relative probabilities.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains consistent with the prior probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
