Let's use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (C) given his description (D).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, we find \( P(C) \) and its complement \( P(H) \) where \( H \) is Jason being a humanities professor:

\[ P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we analyze \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which represent the likelihood of Jason's description for both types of professors. As the problem does not provide specific data to estimate these, we will assume these descriptions can be equally likely among computer science and humanities professors. Thus, \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

Given these assumptions and the lack of distinguishing features in Jason's description that would strongly favor one group over the other, the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) could be considered roughly equal. 

Thus:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), we can simplify this to:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \]

Finally, if \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), it follows that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
