To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our posterior probability based on the likelihood of the observed evidence and the prior probabilities.

Here’s the breakdown of the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description provided for Jason ("high ability and strong motivation... well-liked by his colleagues... enjoys a positive reputation...") does not inherently favor one field over the other strongly without more context. If we assume that this description is equally likely to apply to both computer science professors and humanities professors, we can set the likelihood terms \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) to be equal. Let’s denote it as \( L \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both fields and assuming the likelihood \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = L \cdot 0.75 + L \cdot 0.25 = L \]

So Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{L \cdot 0.75}{L} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
