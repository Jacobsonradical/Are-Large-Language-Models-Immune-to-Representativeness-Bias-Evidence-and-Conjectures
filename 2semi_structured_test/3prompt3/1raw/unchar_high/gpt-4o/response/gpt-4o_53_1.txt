To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs (priors) based on new evidence.

First, let's define our events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The described personality fits Jason.

We need:

1. The prior probability \(P(C)\) that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. The prior probability \(P(H)\) that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. The probability of the description given he is a computer science professor, \(P(D|C)\).
4. The probability of the description given he is a humanities professor, \(P(D|H)\).
5. The total probability of the description, \(P(D)\).

First, calculate the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We need to use the description \(D\) to update these priors. Assuming that the personality traits described are equally likely to be found among both groups (since we have no strong reason to assume otherwise based on the description itself), \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) can be assumed to be the same:

- \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\)

Thus, the total probability of the description \(P(D)\) is:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Because \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), the exact values of \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) cancel each other out. This means we can directly use the priors we calculated earlier:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C) \cdot P(D|C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), we get:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

So, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
