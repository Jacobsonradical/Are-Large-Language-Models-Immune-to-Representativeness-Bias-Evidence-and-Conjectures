To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's the information we have:
- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Description given: Jason is characterized by high ability, strong motivation, and is well-liked by colleagues.

Bayes’ Theorem formula for this scenario is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Assuming the given traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are equally likely for professors in both fields, the probabilities \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) (H for humanities) would be the same. In this case, the computation simplifies as follows:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that the description does not provide additional distinguishing information between the two groups, we assume symmetry:

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

Thus, Bayes’ formula reduces to considering only the priors:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
