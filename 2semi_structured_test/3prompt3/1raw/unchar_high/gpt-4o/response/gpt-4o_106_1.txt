To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's outline the steps for this calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (P(CS)):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities (P(H)):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihoods capture how probable it is to obtain Jason's description given that he is a computer science or humanities professor. This information is not directly provided, so we'll need to assume that, in the absence of specific details distinguishing the personality traits of professors based on their fields, the likelihoods are equivalent:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | H)
     \]
   Assuming equal likelihoods:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H)
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Since \(P(\text{Description})\) is the same for both fields and the likelihoods are assumed to be equal, we get:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.75
     \]

For a formal calculation under the given assumptions:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Given equal likelihoods,
\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
\]

Simplified:
\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = 0.75
\]

So my answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
