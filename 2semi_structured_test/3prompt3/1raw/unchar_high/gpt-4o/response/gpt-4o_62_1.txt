To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor (A).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We need to consider the prior probabilities first.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

For simplicity, let's assume that the description provided (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor, i.e., \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{Hum}) \). In this case, these probabilities cancel each other out in Bayes' theorem.

Now applying Bayes' theorem, we just consider the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(B_{CS}) + P(B_{Hum})} = P(A_{CS}) \]

Since \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{Hum}) \):
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the given data:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
