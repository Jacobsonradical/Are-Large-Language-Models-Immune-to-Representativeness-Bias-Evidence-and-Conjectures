To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors or one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let's denote the description of Jason as event \( D \). We need to determine the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|C) \)) and the likelihood of \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)). However, the description provided is fairly generic and common, and without specific numerical likelihoods given, we'll have to assume that the description could equally likely apply to a computer science or humanities professor. Therefore, we'll assume that \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

Since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately equal and Bayesian inference heavily relies on the prior probabilities in cases of equal likelihoods, we can use the priors directly for our posterior:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \approx P(C)
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \):

\[
P(C|D) \approx P(C) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
