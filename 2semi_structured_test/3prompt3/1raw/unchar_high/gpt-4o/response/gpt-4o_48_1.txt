To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here's how Bayes' theorem works in this context:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Where:
- \(P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description})\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS})\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{CS})\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{description})\) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need the prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\):
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need \(P(\text{description})\):
- This is the normalization term and ensures that the posterior probabilities sum to 1, but we can often compute the posterior directly using the relative likelihoods if we assume the description is equally likely under both categories.

Since the problem does not provide specific details about how likely the description is for both groups, one critical assumption is made for simplicity: the description's likelihood does not significantly differ between the two groups, which leads us to assume \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities})\).

Given the assumption that \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities})\):
- The posterior probability is directly proportional to the prior probability since the description likelihood is the same for both categories.

Thus, the posterior probability (\(P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description})\)) is:
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) \approx P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.
