To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of getting Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of getting Jason's description.

We need to use the information we have:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\(A\)) and 25 humanities professors (\(A^c\)).
- Prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Without additional information about the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we assume that the description is equally likely to be made for any of the professors:

- If \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), these terms cancel each other in Bayes' theorem.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) simply relies on prior probabilities.

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
