To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We also need to consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor

However, since the description given ("high ability", "strong motivation", "well-liked", "positive reputation") does not heavily favor one group over the other, we can reasonably assume that \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) are roughly equivalent.

For simplicity and without additional bias information, we can assume that:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{Humanities}) \)

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Given that \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 0.25 \), and assuming \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{Humanities}) \), we have:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \times 0.75}{P(D)} \quad \text{and} \quad P(\text{Humanities}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{Humanities}) \times 0.25}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) â‰ˆ \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \), the ratio remains as:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) : P(\text{Humanities}|D) = 0.75 : 0.25 = 3 : 1 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science is:

\[ \frac{3}{3+1} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
