To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

We start with the following information:

- Number of computer science professors (\( CS \)): 75
- Number of humanities professors (\( H \)): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) are:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, let's consider the description given for Jason. The description does not provide any specific, distinguishing characteristics that would strongly indicate he belongs to one group or the other. It is reasonable to assume that the traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, and enjoying a positive professional reputation) are equally likely to be found in both computer science and humanities professors.

Let \( D \) denote the description of Jason. Under the assumption that the description does not favor one discipline over the other, the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are roughly equal. Thus, we can write:

\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can update our beliefs:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), we can state:

\[ P(D) \approx P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since the likelihoods are equal and the priors combine proportionally, the calculation simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
