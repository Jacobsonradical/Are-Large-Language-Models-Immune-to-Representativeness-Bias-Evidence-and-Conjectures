This is a probability problem requiring Bayesian reasoning. Let's calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A, also called the likelihood.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

Define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given (Jason's description).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \):

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   - There's a total of 100 professors (75 from Computer Science and 25 from Humanities):
     \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a Humanities professor.
     \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)** and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
   - Since the problem does not specify any particular traits that favor Computer Science professors over Humanities professors in the description given, we assume the probability of the description fitting either category is similar.
     \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**
   - Probability of the description in general, which can be found by:
     \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
     \[ P(B) = (1) \cdot (0.75) + (1) \cdot (0.25) \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
