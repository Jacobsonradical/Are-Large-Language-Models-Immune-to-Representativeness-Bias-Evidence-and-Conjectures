To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's establish the given information:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS).
- There are 25 humanities professors (H).
- Thus, the total number of professors is 100.

We are given that a professor was picked at random, and we have Jason's description. However, his description doesn't provide any information that clearly discriminates between the groups of computer science and humanities professors.

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Let's break this down:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Since no specific details in Jasonâ€™s description lean more towards either discipline, we can assume (without loss of generality and for simplicity) that \( P(D|CS) \) is roughly equal to \( P(D|H) \). Therefore, these terms cancel each other out in the fraction.

Thus, we can simplify:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
