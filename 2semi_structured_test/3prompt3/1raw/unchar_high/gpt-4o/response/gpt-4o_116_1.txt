To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|C) \), the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description does not provide specific information strongly tied to either field, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups, i.e., \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Now, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), they cancel each other out, and we're left with:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\]

Substitute the probabilities:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
```{"probability": "0.75"}```
