To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C).
- There are 25 humanities professors (H).
- The base rate probabilities: \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are the probabilities of the description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively.

Since we don't have specific information differentiating professors by discipline, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups. Thus, \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately equal:

- \( P(D|C) ≈ P(D|H) \).

Therefore, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given \( P(D|C) ≈ P(D|H) \):

\[ P(D) ≈ P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]

Assuming \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
