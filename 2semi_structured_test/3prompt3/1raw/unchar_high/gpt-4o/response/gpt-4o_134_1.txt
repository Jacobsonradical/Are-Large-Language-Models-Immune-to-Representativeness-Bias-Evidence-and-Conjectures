Given the setup of the study, you need to use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we should consider the likelihoods. Assuming the description provided does not favor one field over the other (i.e., no additional information that makes one group more likely to be described this way), we have that:
- \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \approx 1 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \):

\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

So:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
