To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem can be written as: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the problem setup:

1. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100, thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. The probability of the description being of any of the professors is the same since the description was chosen at random. Thus, we assume that the description provided is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \) for simplicity since no specific distinguishing information suggests otherwise.

3. The overall probability of getting any description, \( P(B) \), is simply 1 as any of the 100 descriptions was equally likely to be chosen.

Therefore, we only need:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the same and thus cancel each other out, the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
