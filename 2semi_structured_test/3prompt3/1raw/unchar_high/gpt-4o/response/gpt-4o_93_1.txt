To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event corresponding to the given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \). By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to determine each term in the equation.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   Since there are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors,
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(A^c) \)** (where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor):
   Since there are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors,
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
   Since the description provided does not favor any department specifically (and assuming the given description is equally likely for both types of professors),
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

As we don't have specific data indicating whether the description makes Jason more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor, we assume that the description is equally probable for either group. Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equal, they cancel out in the numerator and denominator of Bayes' theorem, simplifying the calculation:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]

Given:
\[ P(A) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A^c) = 0.25 \]

Finally, by applying the formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1.00} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
