To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting the description of Jason as given.

We'll break it down step-by-step:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- We assume the description \( B \) ("high ability and strong motivation", etc.) does not differentially apply more to one group over the other given the sampling method.

Thus:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason having his specific description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason having his specific description given that he is a humanities professor.

Under the assumption that the descriptions are equally likely by design of the selection process within each group, we have:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

In this scenario, \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), letâ€™s denote this common probability by \( P(B|X) \). Then:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|X) \times P(A) + P(B|X) \times P(\neg A) = P(B|X) \times (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = P(B|X) \times 1 = P(B|X) \]

Since \( P(B|X) \) does not change our ratio in the context of Bayes' theorem with equal likelihoods:
\[ \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(B|X)}{P(B|X)} = 1 \]

Therefore Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = P(A) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
