To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. To do this, let's define the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description that fits Jason.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given data:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description is equally likely for both groups (since we don't have explicit biases in the description that favor one group over the other):

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Therefore, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), let's denote this common value by \( P(D|common) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|common) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|common) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|common) \]

Now, we can simplify Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|common)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|common) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = P(C) \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75:
