To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason exhibits the given characteristics.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) (i.e., that Jason is a humanities professor) is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are not given specific probability distributions for the described characteristics among computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the characteristic description has the same probability of occurring in both groups (i.e., \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)).

Under this assumption, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) simplifies to the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
