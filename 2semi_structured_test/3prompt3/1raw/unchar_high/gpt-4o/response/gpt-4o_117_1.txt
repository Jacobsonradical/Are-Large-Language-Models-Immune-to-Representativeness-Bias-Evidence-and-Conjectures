Given the information provided, we need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.

First, define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Total probability of the description.

Using the given numbers in the sample:
- Number of computer science professors (\( n_{CS} \)) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (\( n_H \)) = 25

So the priors are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming no additional information favors one group over the other in having the described traits, we can approximate:
\[ P(D|C) ≈ P(D|H) \]

The total probability of the description (\( P(D) \)) is a weighted sum of the probabilities for both groups:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) ≈ P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) ≈ P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|C) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) ≈ P(D|C) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) ≈ P(D|C) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) ≈ P(D|C) \]

This simplifies the numerator:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
