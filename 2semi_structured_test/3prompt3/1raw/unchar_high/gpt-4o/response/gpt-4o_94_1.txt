To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We will assume the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are roughly equal because no specific traits linking Jason's description more closely to one group over the other were provided. We can simplify the calculation because:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

However, given the assumption that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \), we can focus on just the priors.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the prior probability:

\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.75 \]

So,
