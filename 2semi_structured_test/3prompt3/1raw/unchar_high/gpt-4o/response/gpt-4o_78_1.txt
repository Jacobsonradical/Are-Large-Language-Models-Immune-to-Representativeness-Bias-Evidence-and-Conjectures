To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to establish the following probabilities:

1. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

Since we do not have any specific information in the description that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume that the probability of the given description being applicable to either group is equal. This assumption leads us to:
   \[
   P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum)
   \]

By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]

Since the description is equally likely for both groups (our assumption), we have:
   \[
   P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum)
   \]

Additionally,
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

Given our assumption:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(description | Hum) \cdot 0.25
   \]
   \[
   = P(description | CS) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) 
   \]
   \[
   = P(description | CS)
   \]

Thus,
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(description | CS)}
   \]
   \[
   = 0.75
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
   \[
   \boxed{0.75}
   \]
Which can be represented as:

```
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
