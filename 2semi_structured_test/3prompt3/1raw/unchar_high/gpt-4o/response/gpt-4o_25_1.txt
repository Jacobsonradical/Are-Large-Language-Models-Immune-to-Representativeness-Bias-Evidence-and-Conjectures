To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The given base rates of professors in the sample are:

- Computer Science Professors (CS): 75
- Humanities Professors (H): 25

The total number of professors is \( 75 + 25 = 100 \).

Bayes' theorem is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, since we're given a random description without specific features that distinguish between the two groups beyond the sample sizes, we can use the base rates directly (i.e., prior probabilities).

The prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description does not provide any differential evidence favoring one group over the other, the posterior probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor is the same as the prior.

Hence:
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
