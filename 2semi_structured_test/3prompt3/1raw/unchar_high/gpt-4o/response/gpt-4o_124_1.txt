To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \): Jason's description.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we'll determine each component:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Without specific data on the differences in descriptions between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that Jason's description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) is equally likely for both groups. Hence, \( P(B|A) \) is not determined to be different from \( P(B|A') \), where \( A' \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

3. **Prior Probability of Humanities Professors, \( P(A') \)**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
     \[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \)**:
   - As with \( P(B|A) \), we assume this is equally likely to Jason's description as a computer science professor. 

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are assumed equal, they cancel out in Bayes' formula, simplifying our calculation to the prior probabilities only:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A')} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
