To determine the correct posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem adjusts the prior probability based on new evidence.

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100
  - Computer Science professors: 75
  - Humanities professors: 25

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, we need to determine the likelihoods of the description matching a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, based on the given description, "Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children. He is known for his high ability and strong motivation. Well-liked by his colleagues, Jason enjoys a positive reputation in his professional environment," there are no distinguishing factors that strongly suggest that one field is more likely than the other. Therefore, we can assume that the description is equally likely to apply to a professor in either field.

If the description is equally likely to match professors in both fields, we do not need to adjust the likelihoods from the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(CS|description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So, our posterior probability is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
