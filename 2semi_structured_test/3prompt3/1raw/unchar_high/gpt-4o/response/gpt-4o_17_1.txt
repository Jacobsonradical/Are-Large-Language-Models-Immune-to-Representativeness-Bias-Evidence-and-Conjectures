To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Firstly, let's determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \).

\[ P(A) \] = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

\[ P(A^c) \] = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Secondly, we need to assess \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), which represent the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. Since the description does not give any direct evidence differentiating between the fields, we will assume that \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \).

\[ P(B|A) \] = Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor = k (some constant)

\[ P(B|A^c) \] = Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor = k (the same constant)

Since \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description, combines both fields:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

Finally, now we apply these to Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, based on the available information and the symmetry assumed in the description probabilities, our posterior feels in favor of Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
