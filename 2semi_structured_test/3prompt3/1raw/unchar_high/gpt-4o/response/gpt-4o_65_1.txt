To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description and the prior information about the study, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor \(P(CS)\):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor \(P(H)\):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor \(P(D|CS)\).
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor \(P(D|H)\).
   
   Without specific data indicating differing probabilities between the two groups based on the provided description, we assume the given description might be equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. Thus:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Applying Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
     \]

   Since \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\) and both are equally likely:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25 = P(D|CS)
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|CS)} = 0.75
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description and assuming no bias in the descriptive likelihood, is 0.75.
