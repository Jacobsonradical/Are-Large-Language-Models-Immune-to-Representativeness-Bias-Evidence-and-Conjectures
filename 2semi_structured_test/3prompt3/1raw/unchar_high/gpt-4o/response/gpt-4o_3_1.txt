To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. This will allow us to update our prior belief based on the given information.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided does not contain any specific information that would distinguish between a computer science and a humanities professor, we assume the likelihood of the description given either category is the same. Hence:

\[ P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum) \]

By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability (\( P(CS | Description) \)) that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Because the likelihood \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Hum) \) are the same, they cancel out in the denominator, so:

\[ P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\{"probability": "0.75"\}
