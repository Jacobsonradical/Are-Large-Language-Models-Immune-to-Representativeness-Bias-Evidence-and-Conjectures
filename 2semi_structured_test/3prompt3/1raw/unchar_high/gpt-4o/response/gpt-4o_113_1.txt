To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant data:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to update our prior probability based on the given description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{C}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability of being a humanities professor)

Given that the description provided doesn't specify characteristics uniquely identifiable to either group, we will assume that the likelihood of receiving this description is the same for both groups. Therefore, the likelihoods are:

- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{C}) \) (probability of the description given a computer science professor)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \) (probability of the description given a humanities professor)

Since we are to treat the description as neutrally representative:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{C}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) = 1 \) (neutral assumption)

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{C} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is constant and doesnâ€™t change the ratio, it simplifies to focus on numerator parts:

\[ P(\text{C} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

Substituting in the equal-likelihood assumption:

\[ P(\text{C} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
