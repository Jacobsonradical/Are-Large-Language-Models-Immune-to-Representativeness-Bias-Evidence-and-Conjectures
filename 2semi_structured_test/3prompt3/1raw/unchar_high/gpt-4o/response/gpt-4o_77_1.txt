To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let’s define our probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are straightforward:
- Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Without additional specific information suggesting that the described characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are significantly more or less common in one group than the other, it’s reasonable to initially assume that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \approx 1 \) due to the absence of distinguishing features.

Applying Bayes' theorem (where \( D \) is the description):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming \( P(D) \) is equivalent for both groups:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
