To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, I'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

We start with the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Thus, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a professor is from humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the description of the professor. Since all professors are described as successful and have been selected for their common personality traits, we assume the probabilities that a professor from either field matches the description are roughly equal. Thus, the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) that the description matches a computer science professor, and the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) that the description matches a humanities professor, might be considered equal.

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), the likelihood does not affect the posterior calculation:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Because \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \) and they contribute equally to \( P(D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
