To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Rule. 

First, let's assess the prior probabilities:

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description of Jason, we need to estimate how likely this description is for both computer science professors and humanities professors. Since no specific indicators in the description strongly differentiate between the two groups, let's assume the description is equally likely for both groups. 

Let's denote this common probability as \( P(d|CS) = P(d|H) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|d) = \frac{P(d|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(d|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(d|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(d|CS) = P(d|H) \), they cancel out:

\[ P(CS|d) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|d) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|d) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|d) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
