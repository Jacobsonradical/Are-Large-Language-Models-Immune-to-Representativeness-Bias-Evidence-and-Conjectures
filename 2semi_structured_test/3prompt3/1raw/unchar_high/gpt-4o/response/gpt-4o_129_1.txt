To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description can be calculated as follows:

1. Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \) :
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \) :
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. Likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \) :
   Since no specific information in the description sets Jason apart as being more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we assume equal likelihood:
   \[
   P(D | CS) = P(D | H)
   \]

4. Normalizing constant (total probability of the description) \( P(D) \) :
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \) is assumed to be equal to \( P(D | H) \):
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 = P(D | CS) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D | CS)
\]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
Since \( P(D | CS) \) cancels out:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
