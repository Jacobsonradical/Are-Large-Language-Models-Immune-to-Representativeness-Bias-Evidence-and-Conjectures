To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the event A (Jason being a computer science professor) happens given that event B (Jason's description) is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the event B (Jason's description) given that event A (Jason being a computer science professor) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A (Jason being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event B (Jason's description) across both groups (computer science and humanities professors).

Let's substitute what we know:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

We also need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since we are not given explicit likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we must assume them to be equal unless we have evidence to suggest otherwise. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Given that we assume these probabilities are roughly equal, the likelihood term will cancel out in Bayes' Theorem, and the result will primarily be determined by the prior probabilities.

Therefore,

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
