To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the given sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the components we need:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group (\(P(\text{CS})\))
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group (\(P(\text{H})\))

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from the computer science group (\(P(\text{description}|\text{CS})\))
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities group (\(P(\text{description}|\text{H})\))

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Probability that the given description comes from a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS}|\text{description})\))

First, let's denote:
- \(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Because the description doesn't strongly favor one discipline over the other and lacks specific traits that might make a person more likely to be in computer science or humanities, let's assume for simplicity that the likelihoods are equally probable:
- \(P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{description}|\text{H}) = 1\)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since we assumed the likelihoods are equal, the conditional probability can be simplified to just the prior probabilities scaled proportionally:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{H}) \times P(\text{H}) \]

Given that:
\[ P(\text{description}) = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
