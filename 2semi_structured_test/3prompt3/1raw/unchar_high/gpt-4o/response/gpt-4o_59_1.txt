To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given the description, we want to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \), the probability he is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(\text{CS | Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description | CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(\text{Description | CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Firstly, we calculate the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Humanities}) \):

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
  \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not strongly sway towards a trait specific to computer science or humanities, we assume the likelihood \( P(\text{Description | CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description | Humanities}) \) are equal. Letâ€™s denote this equal likelihood as \( L \):

\[ P(\text{Description | CS}) = L \]
\[ P(\text{Description | Humanities}) = L \]

Since the description is chosen at random, \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be calculated as a combination of both:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description | CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description | Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = L \cdot 0.75 + L \cdot 0.25 = L \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS | Description}) = \frac{L \cdot 0.75}{L} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
