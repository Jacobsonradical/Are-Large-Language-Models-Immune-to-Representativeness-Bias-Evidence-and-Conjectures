To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): The description fits Jason

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Probability of the description \( P(B) \)**:
   - This is the same for both computer science and humanities professors, but we don't have specific numbers without assumptions.
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - This represents the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Given no specific information, we assume this is roughly equal for both samples in absence of evidence to the contrary.

4. **Posterior probability \( P(A|B) \)**:
   - Since the description seems equally likely for both groups, the \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \) would roughly cancel out the specific numerator, leaving the prior probability to dominate.

Given this information:
\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
