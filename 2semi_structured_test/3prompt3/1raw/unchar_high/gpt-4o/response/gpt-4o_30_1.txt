Given the information and a random selection from the 100 descriptions, we need to update the prior probabilities using Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's establish the prior probabilities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:

- Prior probability for a computer science professor \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability for a humanities professor \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description provided for Jason doesn't give us specific information about traits that could distinctly separate computer science professors from humanities professors. However, we can make a simplifying assumption that the provided personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) are distributed similarly across both groups. 

Therefore, if the description doesn't strongly bias us towards the characteristics of either group, the likelihood ratios of the description for each group would be close to 1:1. This means the posterior would be similar to the prior.

Consequently, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors will essentially be the same as our prior probability:

\[ \text{Posterior probability} = P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
