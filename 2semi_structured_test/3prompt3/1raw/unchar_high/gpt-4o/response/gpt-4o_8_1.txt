Given the information provided and assuming the selection of descriptions is random, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. We'll start by identifying the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the description.

### Prior Probabilities:
- Probability that Jason is from computer science (P(CS)) = Number of CS professors / Total professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is from humanities (P(H)) = Number of humanities professors / Total professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25

### Likelihoods:
The description doesn't provide direct evidence leaning towards either discipline (computer science or humanities). Instead, it gives general personality traits and background information that seem equally applicable to either field based on the provided context.

Since the description is general, we will assume that the likelihood of such a description being matched with a computer science professor or a humanities professor is the same.

Therefore:
- Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) ≈ 1
- Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (P(Description | H)) ≈ 1

### Posterior Probability:
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
