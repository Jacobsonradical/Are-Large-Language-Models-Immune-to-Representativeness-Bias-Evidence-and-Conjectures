Given the provided information, we start with the base rate or prior probability derived from the distribution of the professors. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{Prior}(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ \text{Prior}(Humanities) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, considering the description given for Jason ("high ability and strong motivation," and "well-liked by his colleagues"), we need to assess if this information changes our prior probabilities. However, the description could apply to successful professors in both computer science and the humanities, and there is nothing specifically distinguishing Jason's field.

In the absence of any additional specific information pointing more towards one discipline over the other, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Thus, the likelihood ratio is 1, meaning the posterior probability will not change from the prior probability.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": 0.75}} \]
