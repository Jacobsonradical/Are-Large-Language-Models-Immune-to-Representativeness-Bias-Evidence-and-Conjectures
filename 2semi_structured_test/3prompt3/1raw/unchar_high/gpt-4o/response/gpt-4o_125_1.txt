First, we'll use Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Bayes' theorem is defined by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate the following:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description across all professors.

Since Jason was chosen at random from 100 professors, and there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \), is:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description given (Jason being a 30-year-old married man without children, high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, and enjoying a positive reputation) does not favor computer science or humanities professors more significantly (i.e., it is equally likely for professors in both fields to have such a description), we can set:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

So our posterior probability estimation simplifies, as \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) cancel out in a relative comparison. Thus:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given the uniform likelihood assumption:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
