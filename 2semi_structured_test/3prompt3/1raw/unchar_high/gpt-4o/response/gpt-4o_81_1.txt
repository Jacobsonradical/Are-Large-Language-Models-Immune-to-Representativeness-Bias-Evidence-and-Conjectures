To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (C) is \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (H) is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the given description (D) for each group. Since the description doesn't specify any traits that clearly distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors, we'll assume that the likelihoods are equal:
   - \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - By Bayes' theorem: 
   \[
   P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   - Given that \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), we have:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | C) \times P(C) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
   \]
   Substituting the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(D) \approx P(D | C) \times 0.75 + P(D | H) \times 0.25
   \]
   Since \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), they cancel out in Bayes' formula yielding:
   \[
   P(C | D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.

Here is the formatted answer:
