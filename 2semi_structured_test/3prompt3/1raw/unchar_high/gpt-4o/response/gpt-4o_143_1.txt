To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability:** The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability:** Similarly, the prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood:** We need to consider the likelihood that a professor with Jason's description comes from each group (CS or Hum). Given the lack of specific distinguishing traits in the description, we assume Jason is equally likely to be described this way in either field.
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \)

4. **Normalization Constant:** The total probability \( P(\text{description}) \) of getting Jason's description across both groups.

Since descriptions are assumed to be equally likely given either group:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

5. **Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \), they cancel out:

So,
\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the given information:
