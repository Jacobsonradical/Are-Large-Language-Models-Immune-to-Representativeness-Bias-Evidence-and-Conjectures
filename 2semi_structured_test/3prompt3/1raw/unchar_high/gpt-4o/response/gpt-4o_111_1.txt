To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the description provided.

Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   - \( P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):**
   We are not given specific likelihoods for the descriptions fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. In absence of specific information, we assume the description is equally likely to describe someone from either group:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS professor}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities professor}) = 1 \)

3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(B) \):**
   Since the description is equally likely among all professors:
   - \( P(B) = P(\text{Description}) = 1 \)

Given these assumptions, Bayes' theorem simplifies as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
