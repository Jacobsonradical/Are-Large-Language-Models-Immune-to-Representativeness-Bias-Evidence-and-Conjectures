To determine the posterior probability based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- The prior probability of selecting a CS professor, P(CS), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of selecting a H professor, P(H), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the given description under each category. However, since the description is not detailed enough to give specific probabilities and seems generic, we can assume that the likelihoods for being a CS or H professor are the same. This means:

- P(description | CS) â‰ˆ P(description | H)

Since the likelihoods are the same, according to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Since the denominator P(description) is constant and doesn't change the ratio, we focus on the numerators:

- P(CS | description) is proportional to P(CS)
- P(H | description) is proportional to P(H)

Thus, the posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor remains equal to the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
