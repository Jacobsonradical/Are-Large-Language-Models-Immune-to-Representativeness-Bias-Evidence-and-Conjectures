To address this problem, we will employ Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here is the thought process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
   - Hence, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Unfortunately, the description provided about Jason ("high ability," "strong motivation," "well-liked by colleagues," "positive reputation") could plausibly apply to professors in either discipline.
   - Without specific information regarding the typical personality traits or other characteristics of professors in computer science versus the humanities, we'll assume that the likelihood of such a description is equally probable across both fields. That is, P(Description|CS) â‰ˆ P(Description|H).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - According to Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     \text{Posterior} = \frac{\text{Prior} \times \text{Likelihood}}{\text{Evidence}}
     \]
   - Since P(Description|CS) and P(Description|H) are approximately equal, they cancel each other out in the Bayes' theorem formula. Thus, the posterior probability is driven primarily by the prior probability.

Given these conditions, the posterior probability can be calculated directly from the prior probability:

\[
\text{Posterior} = P(CS) = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
