To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description \( B \).

First, let's start with the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B| \neg A) \), the probabilities of having the description given either Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Since the description of Jason is quite general and does not provide specific details that are more likely to be associated with one field over the other, we can assume that:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Given that there's no strong reason to believe that the description is more common in either group based on the provided information, their values can be considered roughly equal. For simplicity, let's set these probabilities to be approximately equal:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B| \neg A) \]

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of the description \( B \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B| \neg A) \cdot P( \neg A) \]
\[ P(B) \approx k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) \approx k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) \approx k \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(B) \approx k \]

Since \( k \) cancels out in this context due to the assumed equality \( P(B|A) \approx P(B| \neg A) \), we can proceed to calculate \( P(A|B) \) using:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Given that the description does not favor one group over the other, the prior probability remains the best estimate for the posterior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
