To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- The number of computer science professors in the study: 75
- The number of humanities professors in the study: 25
  
A priori probabilities:
- P(CS): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that differentiates between professors in computer science and the humanities, so we can assume the likelihoods of this description given either of the categories are the same.

Under these assumptions, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, P(CS | Jason's description), can be directly influenced by the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

P(CS | Jason's description) = P(CS) = 0.75

Here's the final answer:

{"probability": "0.75"}
