To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description for each group.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since 75 out of 100 professors are computer scientists)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since 25 out of 100 professors are humanities professors)

We need to determine \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We also need to determine \( P(H|D) \):

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(D\) is the same in both cases, we can focus on the ratio of these probabilities.

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), i.e., the likelihoods that the description fits a computer scientist or a humanities professor.

Given the generic description highlighting high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, we can assume that these attributes might be roughly equally probable among both groups of successful academics. Thus, \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \) (in which case the exact values cancel out):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
