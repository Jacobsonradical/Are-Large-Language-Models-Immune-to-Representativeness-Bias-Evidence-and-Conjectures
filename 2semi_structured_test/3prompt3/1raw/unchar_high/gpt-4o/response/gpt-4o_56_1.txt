To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to take into account the base rates and the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) = Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities for the groups:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that we don't have direct probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we'll make the simplifying assumption that the description is equally likely for both groups (a simplifying assumption due to lack of specific data specifics). Therefore, \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \). 

Using the equal likelihood assumption, the priors dominate:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is roughly:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
