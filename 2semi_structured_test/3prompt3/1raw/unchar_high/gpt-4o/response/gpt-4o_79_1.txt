Given the information in the problem, the prior probabilities need to be considered along with any specific information about Jason.

Before considering Jason's description, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Jason's description mentions that he is well-liked, highly able, and strongly motivated. However, the description does not provide specific details that would favor either computer science or humanities more heavily. Given this lack of definitive evidence to update our priors, we should rely heavily on the initial probabilities.

Therefore, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given that his description does not strongly sway in one direction, would be largely in line with the prior.

Answer: {"probability": "0.75"}
