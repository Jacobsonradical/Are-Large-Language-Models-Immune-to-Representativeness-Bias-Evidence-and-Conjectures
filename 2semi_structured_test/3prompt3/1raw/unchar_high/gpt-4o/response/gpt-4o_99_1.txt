To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll consider the prior probabilities and the evidence.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   Since we don't have data suggesting that the traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are more likely in one group than the other, we can assume that the evidence does not favor either group. That is:
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science: \( P(description | CS) \approx 1 \)
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities: \( P(description | H) \approx 1 \)

3. **Posterior Probabilities:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   Since \( P(description) \) is the same for both groups (as it normalizes the probabilities and includes both groups equally), we only need to rely on the priors \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \).

Thus:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]


Substituting the values:
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25}
\]
\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
