To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem. Here, our hypotheses are:

- \(H_{1}\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_{2}\): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the setup of the study, we know the prior probabilities:
- \(P(H_{1})\) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H_{2})\) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.

With 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the priors are:
- \(P(H_{1}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H_{2}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \(P(D|H_{1})\) is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H_{2})\) is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the problem does not provide specific data on these likelihoods, we'll assume that these descriptions are uniformly distributed across both groups due to a lack of differentiation between the two sets.

Hence,
- \(P(D|H_{1}) \approx P(D|H_{2}) \approx 1\)

Since the description does not specify any trait that significantly suggests a higher likelihood in one group over the other, we will treat them as equally likely.

Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{1}|D) = \frac{P(D|H_{1})P(H_{1})}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both:
\[ P(H_{1}|D) \approx P(H_{1}) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based predominantly on the prior probability:
\[ P(H_{1}|D) = 0.75 \]

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
