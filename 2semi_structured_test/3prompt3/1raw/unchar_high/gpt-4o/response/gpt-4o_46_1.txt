To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

For this problem:
- Let's denote \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let's denote \( \neg A \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \), knowing 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \), knowing 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we have no specific information that differentiates the description for computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \).

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]
So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
