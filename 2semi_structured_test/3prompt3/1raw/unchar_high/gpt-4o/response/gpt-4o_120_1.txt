To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, P(CS), is 75/100 = 0.75.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities, P(Hum), is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description given does not provide specific information to distinguish between computer science and humanities professors; it only speaks of general traits that can apply to both fields. Therefore, if we assume these traits are equally likely among computer science and humanities professors, then:
   - P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum) = 1 (since the information does not favor one group over the other).

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum|Description) = \frac{P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Since P(Description) is the same for both:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) \propto P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|Description) \propto 1 \cdot 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum|Description) \propto P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum|Description) \propto 1 \cdot 0.25
   \]

   Normalizing these:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
