To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We can break this down into the following components:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities.

Given the makeup of the sample: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Probability of the Description Given the Type of Professor:**
Without additional details about how descriptions vary between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume that the provided description is equally likely to describe professors from both disciplines. That is, \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \) are equal.

\[ P(\text{description} | C) = P(\text{description} | H) \]

3. **Total Probability of the Description:**
Since the description is assumed to be equally likely for both groups and we have the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the assumption that \( P(\text{description} | C) = P(\text{description} | H) \),
let's denote \( P(\text{description} | C) = P(\text{description} | H) = k \).

Thus,
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.75"}
