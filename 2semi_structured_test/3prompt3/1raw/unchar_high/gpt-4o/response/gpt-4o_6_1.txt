{"probability": "0.75"}
```

This probability is based on the distribution of the sample: 75 out of 100 individuals are computer science professors, which implies a prior probability of 0.75. There is no specific information in the provided description that distinctly favors one group over the other, so the posterior probability remains largely influenced by the prior distribution.
