Given the information provided and using Bayes' theorem for updating our prior probabilities, we begin with the fact that the base rate for being a computer science professor in the sample is 75 out of 100.

This gives us a prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \):

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \):

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The given description, although detailed, does not have specific distinguishing features that would significantly differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. It describes traits like high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation, which could apply to successful professionals in both fields. 

Because of the lack of distinctive characteristics in the description that lean toward one field over the other, we can assume the likelihood of such a description being written for someone in either group may be roughly equal. Therefore, we'll assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

Thus, using Bayes' theorem, we can approximate the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description}) \) would be the same for both groups under our assumption, the formula simplifies back to considering the priors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) \approx 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is around 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:
