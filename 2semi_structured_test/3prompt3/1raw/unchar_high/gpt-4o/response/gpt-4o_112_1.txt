Sure! Let's use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's set up the numbers we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, out of a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given that we have no reason to believe Jasonâ€™s description is more likely for one group over the other, we'll assume \( P(B|A) \) is equal to \( P(B|A^c) \), i.e., descriptions are equally likely for both groups.

This means \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \).

Now, because these probabilities are equal,

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 = P(B|A) \]

Therefore,

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the formatted answer:

{"probability": "0.75"}
