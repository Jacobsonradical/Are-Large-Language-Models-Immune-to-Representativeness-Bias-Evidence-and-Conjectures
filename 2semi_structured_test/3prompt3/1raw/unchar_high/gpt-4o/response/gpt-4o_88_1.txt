To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the setup:

- We have a total of 100 professors, with 75 in computer science and 25 in humanities.
- We know Jason fits a description common to both groups.
  
Using Bayes' theorem:

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that he's a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

### Calculations

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Assumption of \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):** 
   Since we have no information indicating that the description is more likely for either group, we assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

3. **Overall probability \( P(D) \):**
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   Given our assumption that \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|C) \]

We see that \( P(D|C) \) cancels out, leaving us with just the priors:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
