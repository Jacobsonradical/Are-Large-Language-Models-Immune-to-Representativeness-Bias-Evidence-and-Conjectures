To determine the probability that Jason, described as a 30-year-old man without children, is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|A) \): Likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, assume equal likelihoods for the description between the computer science and humanities professors since no specific information differentiates between the two categories in the description given. Therefore:
\[ P(D|A) = P(D|B) \]

Given that \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) \), the posterior probability simplifies:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|B) \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, is:
