To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description given.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Firstly, we need to establish our prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( (P(A)) \) is 75 out of 100, which is 0.75.
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( (P(\neg A)) \) is 25 out of 100, which is 0.25.

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods. Since we are given the general description of Jason without specific distinguishing features that significantly favor either computer science or humanities, we might consider that the description could be equally likely for both groups:

- Let's assume that \( P(B|A) \approx 1 \).
- Similarly, assume that \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \).

Given that the description is assumed to be equally likely for both groups, the total probability of the description (P(B)) can be considered as a weighted average:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|\neg A) * P(\neg A) \]

Using our simplified equal likelihoods:

\[ P(B) = 1 * 0.75 + 1 * 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 * 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
