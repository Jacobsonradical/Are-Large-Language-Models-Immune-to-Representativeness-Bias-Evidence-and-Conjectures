To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring.

First, let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \),
- And \( P(\text{not } A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming the description is equally likely to be written for a computer science professor or a humanities professor (no specific information pointing towards either group), we get:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not } A) \).

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not } A) \), and we need the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not } A) \), these terms cancel each other out, leaving:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\text{not } A)} \]

Simplifying with known probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{1} \]

Therefore:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
