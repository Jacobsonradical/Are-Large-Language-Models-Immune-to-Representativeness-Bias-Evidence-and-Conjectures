To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Firstly, we note the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we have no specific reason to believe the description \( D \) is more likely for humanities professors than for computer science professors, we may assume that:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Given this assumption, the total probability \( P(D) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can denote this common value as \( k \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = k \cdot 1 = k \]

Thus,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
