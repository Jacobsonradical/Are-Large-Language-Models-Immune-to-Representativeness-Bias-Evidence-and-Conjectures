To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The prior probabilities are based on the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the study:

- Probability of a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability of a humanities professor (\(P(H))\): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We are given a description that could apply to any professor, without any specific information favoring one discipline over the other. This means that the likelihoods (\(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\)) are assumed to be the same. As such, the posterior probability will be driven purely by the priors.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{\{"probability": "0.75"\}}
