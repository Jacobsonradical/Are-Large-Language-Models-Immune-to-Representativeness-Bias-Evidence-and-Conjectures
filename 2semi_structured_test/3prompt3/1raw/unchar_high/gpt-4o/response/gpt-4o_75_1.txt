To answer this question, we'll apply Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description provided.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (event B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- Event \( A_1 \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- Event \( A_2 \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Event \( B \): The description of Jason.

Given the numbers from the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_1) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we assume that the likelihood of the description (event B) given Jason's profession is the same for both computer science and humanities professors because the description does not provide specific evidence favoring either group. Thus, we let:
- \( P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) = 1 \) (assuming equal likelihood for simplicity).

The overall probability of the description, \( P(B) \), can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
