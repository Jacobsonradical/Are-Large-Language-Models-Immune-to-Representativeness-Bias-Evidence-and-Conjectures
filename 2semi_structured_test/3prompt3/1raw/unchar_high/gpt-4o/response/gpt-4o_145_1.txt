To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, letâ€™s determine the prior probability, \( P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Since we have no reason to believe that the description is more likely for one group over the other, we can assume:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
