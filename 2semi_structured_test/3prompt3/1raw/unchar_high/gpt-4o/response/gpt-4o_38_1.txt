To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as Jason's description.

We want to calculate \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ P(D | C) \cdot P(C) }{ P(D) } \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that the description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the description is of a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that it is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that it is of a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description \( D \) provided is fairly general and does not specify any domain-specific traits that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we can initially assume that \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \).

Let's simplify this further:
\[ P(D | C) = P(D | H) \]

Therefore, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equal, let's denote this common probability as \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) = k \).

Thus:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Now Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ P(D | C) \cdot P(C) }{ P(D) } = \frac{ k \cdot 0.75 }{ k } = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
