First, let's start with the prior probabilities. We know that 75 out of the 100 professors are from computer science, and 25 are from the humanities. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \) is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the description of Jason and whether it provides any additional information that might allow us to update these probabilities. The description mentions that Jason is 30 years old, married without children, highly capable, strongly motivated, and well-liked by his colleagues. However, no specific details strongly differentiate between computer science professors and humanities professors based purely on the given description.

Since the description does not provide significant additional discriminative information, we cannot update our prior probabilities in a meaningful way. Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
