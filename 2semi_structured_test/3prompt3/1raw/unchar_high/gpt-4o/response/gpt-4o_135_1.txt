To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, I'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

The prior probability (\( P(A) \)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability (\( P(A^c) \)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without additional specific information on how likely either group exhibits the described traits, we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups, i.e.:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Thus,
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

If we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), then these cancel out, leaving:
\[ P(B) = P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 \]

Realizing we don't have any specific bias towards the description with respect to either discipline, the posterior probability essentially reflects the initial proportion of the groups.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) essentially remains the same as the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
