To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75 out of 100 = 0.75
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor (P(Hum)): 25 out of 100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Assume the description provided is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors since no specific distinguishing information is provided that favors one discipline over the other. Therefore:
     - P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
     \]
     \[
     P(Hum | Description) = \frac{P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(Description)}
     \]
   - Since P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum), the normalization factor (P(Description)) is the same for both; we can ignore it when calculating the relative probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors simplifies to the ratio of the priors:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
