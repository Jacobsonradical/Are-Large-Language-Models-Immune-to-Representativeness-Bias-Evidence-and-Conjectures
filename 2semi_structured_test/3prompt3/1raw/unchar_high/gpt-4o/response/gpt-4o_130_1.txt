To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the information and apply the formula step-by-step.

Firstly, we have the following prior probabilities and information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), and the prior probability \( P(\text{Hum}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to update these probabilities based on the given description of Jason. However, the description provided does not give any clear, distinguishing characteristics specific to computer science or humanities professors. In the absence of discriminative information, we assume the likelihood of such descriptions is equal among both groups.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since the description does not favor either group, we assume

\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \]

The denominator \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \) are equal and can be denoted as \( P(\text{Description}) \), the equation simplifies and normalises to:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Hum})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
