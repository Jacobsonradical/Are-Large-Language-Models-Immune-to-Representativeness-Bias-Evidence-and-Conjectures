Let's analyze the problem using Bayesian reasoning. First, we note the prior probabilities â€” the base rates of the two groups:

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \):
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \):
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

Next, we need to consider how likely the description of Jason matches each group. However, we have no specific evidence in the description that directly distinguishes Jason as more likely to be in one group over the other. Given that we lack any distinguishing features and cannot strongly favor one group over the other based purely on Jason's description, we use the base rates for our posterior probability.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \), remains proportional to the prior probability:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) \approx P(CS) = 0.75
\]

Hence, the posterior probability is:
\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}
\]
