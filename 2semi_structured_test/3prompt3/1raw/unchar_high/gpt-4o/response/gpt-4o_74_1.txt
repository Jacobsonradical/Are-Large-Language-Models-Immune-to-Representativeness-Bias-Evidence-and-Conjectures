The problem at hand involves applying Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the given description of Jason.

We'll break this down step by step:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (prior probability \(P(A)\)):
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
     \[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Assume that the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, \(P(B|CS)\) and \(P(B|Hum)\), is roughly equal, as there is no specific information suggesting otherwise in the description provided.
   
3. Since the description does not particularly favor either field and we have no reason to believe one field is more likely given the description, we can assume:
   \[ P(B|CS) \approx P(B|Hum) \]

Given that \(P(B|CS)\) and \(P(B|Hum)\) are assumed to be equal, the posterior probability will essentially be driven by the prior probabilities.

So,
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B|CS) \approx P(B|Hum) \),
\[ P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) \approx P(B|Hum)\cdot P(Hum) \]

\[ \frac{P(B|CS)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(CS)}{ P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]
\[ \Rightarrow P(CS|B) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{0.75 + 0.25}=0.75 \]

Thus, our posterior that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.75" \]

So the final answer is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
