To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We will define the events as follows:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of getting the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the setup:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.

The priors are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without precise data on \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we'd typically assume that the description being provided is equally likely among both groups unless there's specific information suggesting otherwise.

Thus, for simplicity, we can assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) can be broken down as follows:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given our assumption that \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are roughly equal:
\[
P(D) \approx P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 = P(D | CS) \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) + P(D | CS) \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = P(D | CS)
\]

Thus:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | CS)} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
