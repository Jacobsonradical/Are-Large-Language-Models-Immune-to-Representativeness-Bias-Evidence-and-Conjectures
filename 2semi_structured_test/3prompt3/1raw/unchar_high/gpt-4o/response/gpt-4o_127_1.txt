To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given: 
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

We need to assess \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}) \). 

For now, let's assume that Jason's description does not provide significant distinguishing characteristics between the groups apart from what is already encapsulated by the priors. This assumption simplifies the calculation because it suggests \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 1 \) assuming descriptions were written without bias.

Our assumption implies \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 1\).

Given that, we simplify:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75.
