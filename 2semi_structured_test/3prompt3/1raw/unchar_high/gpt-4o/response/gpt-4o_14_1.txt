Given that we have a description of Jason and need to calculate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem to find this posterior probability.

Let's break down the problem using the given data:

- We have 75 computer science professors.
- We have 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors is 100.

To calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS | \text{Description}) \), where \( CS \) represents the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \(\text{Description}\) represents the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of drawing someone with Jason's description from the entire sample.
- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description given that the professor is from computer science.

We assume that the description given is equally likely for both groups because no specific information suggests otherwise.

Since we need to determine \( P(\text{Description}) \), which is the overall probability of the description, we can express it as a weighted sum of the conditional probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given our previous assumption, \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), let's call this common value \( P(D) \). Hence,

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(D) \cdot 0.75 + P(D) \cdot 0.25 = P(D) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D) \]

Therefore, the common factor \( P(D) \) cancels out when we calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(D) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
