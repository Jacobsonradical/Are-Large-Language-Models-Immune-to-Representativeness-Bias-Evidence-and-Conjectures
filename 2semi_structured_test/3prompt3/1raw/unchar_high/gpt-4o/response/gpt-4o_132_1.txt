To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\): Description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation)

We need to find \(P(C|D)\). Bayes' Theorem tells us that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that a random professor is from computer science.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the marginal probability of the description. We can compute this using the law of total probability:
  \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description \(D\) is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors (since we have no information to the contrary), we get:
- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)
  
Since \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are equal and will cancel out in the Bayes' formula, we only need the priors to find the posterior. Hence:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Given the priors:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus:

{"probability": "0.75"}
