To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is stated as:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

In this case:
- Hypothesis \( H_1 \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- Hypothesis \( H_2 \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Evidence \( E \): The description of Jason.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- Total number of professors = 100 (75 computer scientists + 25 humanities professors).
- Prior probability \( P(H_1) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- Prior probability \( P(H_2) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given that we do not have any specific information that differentiates Jason from either group based on the description, we can assume the description is equally likely for both groups, meaning \( P(E | H_1) = P(E | H_2) \); both are 1 (or any constant factor, which cancels out).

So, our task simplifies to comparing the priors weighted by these likelihoods.

The likelihood \( P(E | H_1 \) (Computer Scientist): 1
The likelihood \( P(E | H_2 \) (Humanities): 1

Then by Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
