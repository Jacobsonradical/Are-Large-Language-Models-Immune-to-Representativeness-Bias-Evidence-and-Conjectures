To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we first need to consider the prior probabilities and apply Bayes' theorem.

The prior probabilities are given by the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

From the description of Jason, there is no specific discriminating information indicating whether Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other. Based purely on the given proportions and assuming that personality traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are equally likely to be found in successful professors of both fields, we can use the prior probabilities directly.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
