To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided.

We are looking for \( P(CS \mid D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods \(P(D \mid CS)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\). However, the description does not strongly differentiate between disciplines, and without additional information, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihoods of such general positive traits are roughly equal for both groups.

Therefore, we can assume:

\[
P(D \mid CS) \approx P(D \mid H) 
\]

Also, since we have no strong evidence to favor one discipline over the other based solely on the description, we will assume that these likelihoods are equal.

Since:

\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS)P(CS) + P(D \mid H)P(H)
\]

If \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \), then:

\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \times (P(CS) + P(H))
\]

Given our assumption, the overall probability simplifies because:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
