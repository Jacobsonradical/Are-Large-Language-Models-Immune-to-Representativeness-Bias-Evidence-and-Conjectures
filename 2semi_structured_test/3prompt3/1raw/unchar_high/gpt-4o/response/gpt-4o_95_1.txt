First, we need to determine the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. This is calculated by the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[
P(Hum) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need to consider the description of Jason and how it informs us about his likelihood of being a computer science or humanities professor. Since the description does not provide specific information relevant to either field (such as technical skills, specific interests, or subject-related activities), we assume that the probability of a professor having such a general profile is roughly equal in both fields.

Hence, we assume that the description of Jason is equally likely to be given for both computer science and humanities professors:

\[
P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum)
\]

Applying Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since \(P(Description)\) is the same regardless of whether the professor is from computer science or humanities and we assumed \(P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum) \):

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, given the description and the composition of the sample, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
