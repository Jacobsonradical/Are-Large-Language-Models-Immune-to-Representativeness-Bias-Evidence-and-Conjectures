To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason has the given description.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes’ theorem:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]

We already know:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are probabilities of Jason having the description given that he is from computer science and humanities, respectively. Given that there’s no additional information to differentiate between the two groups based on the description, we assume these probabilities are equal:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Since we have no reason to believe the description is biased towards one field, let's assume:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{1} = 0.75 
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \boxed{0.75} \).

Thus,
