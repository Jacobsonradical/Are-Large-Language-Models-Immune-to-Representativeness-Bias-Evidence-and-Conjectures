To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to take into account the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description for each group (computer science and humanities professors). 

Here are the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor:**
   There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor:**
   There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor (P(Description | CS))**:
   Let's denote this as \( L_{CS} \). Since we have no specific information that differentiates how well the description fits a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we assume equal likelihood:
   \[
   L_{CS} = P(Description | CS) = 1
   \]

4. **Likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor (P(Description | Hum))**:
   Similarly, we assume:
   \[
   L_{Hum} = P(Description | Hum) = 1
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since \( P(Description) \) is the same for both cases, it can be written as:
\[
P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

Let's plug in the values:
\[
P(Description) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1
\]

So,
\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

\[
{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"}
\]
