First, observe the base rates of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor before observing any additional information is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor before observing any additional information is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, let's consider whether it provides any additional discriminative information. The description mentions common traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and positive relations with colleagues, which could apply to both computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, without additional specific information that heavily favors one group over the other, we will assume that it does not significantly alter the prior probabilities.

With no strong reason to update our prior beliefs based on the given description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains similar to the prior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
