First, we need to use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): We have the description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science sample. There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.

   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities sample. There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)** and \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
    - It's stated that Jason is well-liked, highly capable, and strongly motivated, but these traits are not exclusive to a specific field. Let's assume that the probability of these traits (description B) being ascribed to a computer science professor or a humanities professor are roughly the same due to the given selection criteria (successful and tenured professors). We can consider this to be about equal:
    
   \[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \approx 1 \]

Given the above simplification, the probability denoted as the "Normalization Constant" will be roughly:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
