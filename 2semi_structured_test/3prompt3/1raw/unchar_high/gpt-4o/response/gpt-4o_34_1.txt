To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let us define the prior probabilities:

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (P(HUM)) is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

Since we have no reason to believe that the description specifically favors one group over another based on the given information, we will assume that the likelihood of Jason's description (D) being applied to either group is the same (P(D|CS) = P(D|HUM)). Therefore, P(D|CS) and P(D|HUM) can be considered equal and will cancel each other out in Bayes' theorem.

Now, Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since P(D) can be considered as a normalizing constant and does not affect the ratio, we simplify to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HUM)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
