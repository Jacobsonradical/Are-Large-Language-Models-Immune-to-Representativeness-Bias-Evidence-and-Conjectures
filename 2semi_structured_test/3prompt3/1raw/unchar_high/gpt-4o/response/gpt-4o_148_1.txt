To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The quantities we need are:

1. The prior probabilities:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities (\(P(H)\)).

Given the 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The likelihoods:
   - Probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)).
   - Probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)).

Without additional information, we'll assume that the likelihood of observing "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked" is equally likely among both groups. Therefore:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

3. The posterior probability:
   - We want to find \(P(CS|D)\).

Bayes' Theorem says:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25} \]

If \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), they cancel out:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the calculation:

\[ \text{"probability": 0.75} \]
