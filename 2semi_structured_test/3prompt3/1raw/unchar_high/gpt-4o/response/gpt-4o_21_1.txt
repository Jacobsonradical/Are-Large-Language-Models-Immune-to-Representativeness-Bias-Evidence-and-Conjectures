To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as Jason being a humanities professor.

We are interested in \( P(CS | D) \), where \( D \) is the description provided.

First, we need to establish some prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description given the categories:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Given only the information provided, we assume the description is equally likely for professors in both fields since there is no specific indication that distinguishes one group from the other based on the description. Therefore:
- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1 \) (simplifying assumption).

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description across all professors:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
