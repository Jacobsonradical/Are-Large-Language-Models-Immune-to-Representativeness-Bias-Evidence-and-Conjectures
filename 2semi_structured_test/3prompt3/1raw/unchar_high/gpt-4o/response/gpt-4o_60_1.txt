{"probability": "0.75"}

This posterior probability is based on the fact that the sample includes 75 computer science professors out of 100 (75%), and the description does not provide specific information to deviate from the prior distribution substantially. Therefore, given no additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
