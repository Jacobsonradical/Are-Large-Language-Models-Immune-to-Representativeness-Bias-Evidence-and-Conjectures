To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is mathematically expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of \( A \) given \( B \)
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of \( B \) given \( A \)
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \)
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of \( B \)

Let's define our terms related to this problem:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): The description of Jason

### Prior Probabilities
- \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### Likelihood
Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups because it doesn't contain specific traits that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we use:

- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

### Marginal Probability
We calculate the marginal probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), the calculation simplifies, and since we need the posterior, we only need the ratio:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is \( 0.75 \).
