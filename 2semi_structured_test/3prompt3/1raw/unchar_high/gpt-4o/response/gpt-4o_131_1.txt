To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider:

1. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science (CS) professor or a humanities professor.
2. The likelihood of the description provided given that Jason is a CS professor or a humanities professor.
3. The evidence (or the total probability of the description regardless of discipline).

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) be the total probability of the description.

From the problem setup:
- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We assume that the description does not preferentially favor one group over the other, so \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \). When this holds, the likelihood ratios cancel out and only the priors remain influential.

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \) and \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \), we can simplify:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
