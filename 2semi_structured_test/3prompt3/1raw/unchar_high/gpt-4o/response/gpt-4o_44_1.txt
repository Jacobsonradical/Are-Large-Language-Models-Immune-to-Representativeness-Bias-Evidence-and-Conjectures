To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we identify our prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors (P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75).
- There are 25 humanities professors (P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25).

Next, we consider the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. This is where some subjectivity may come into play, but we'll proceed with the information and assumptions we have.

Given no specific indicators that Jason's description uniquely identifies him as a computer science professor or humanities professor, we assume that the description applies to both groups equally likely. This implies:

- P(Description|CS) ≈ P(Description|H) = 1 (since the likelihood is equally probable for both).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since P(Description) can be seen as a normalizing constant that doesn’t affect the relative probabilities, we can focus on:

\[
P(CS|Description) \propto P(Description|CS) * P(CS)
\]

Substituting in the assumed equal likelihoods:

\[
P(CS|Description) \propto 1 * 0.75 = 0.75
\]

Similarly, for the humanities professors:

\[
P(H|Description) \propto 1 * 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To get the normalized posterior probability:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
