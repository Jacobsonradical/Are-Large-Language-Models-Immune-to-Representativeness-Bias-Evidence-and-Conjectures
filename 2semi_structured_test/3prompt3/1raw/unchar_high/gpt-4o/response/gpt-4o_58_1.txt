To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- The base rates (prior probabilities) of the groups:
  - Computer Science Professors: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
  - Humanities Professors: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
  
- Identifying features from the description:
  - No specific features uniquely identifying Jason's field were provided in the description.
  
Because the description does not specifically favor one field over the other in any obvious way, we assume that the likelihood of such a description fitting someone from either group is roughly equal. Thus, the likelihood of such a description from both groups is the same. 

Given that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior distribution of the groups.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \(P(A|B)\) where \(A\) is the event Jason is a computer science professor and \(B\) is the given description:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|Â¬A)\) are equal (description likelihood given either group), \(P(A|B)\) simplifies to the prior probability \(P(A)\):

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
