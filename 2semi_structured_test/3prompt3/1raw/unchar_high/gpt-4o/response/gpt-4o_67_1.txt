To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is in computer science given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 professors in computer science (CS).
- There are 25 professors in humanities (H).
 
Thus:
- \( P(A) = P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

For the description of Jason (denoted as \( B \)), we must assume that the description is equally likely in both CS and humanities unless stated otherwise. Thus:

- \( P(B|CS) \approx P(B|H) \approx 1 \) (assuming the description of high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation is typical for both fieldsâ€”since both sets are composed of successful professors).

So we use:

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(B|CS) = P(B|H) \approx 1 \):

\[ P(B) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Therefore, by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is therefore:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
