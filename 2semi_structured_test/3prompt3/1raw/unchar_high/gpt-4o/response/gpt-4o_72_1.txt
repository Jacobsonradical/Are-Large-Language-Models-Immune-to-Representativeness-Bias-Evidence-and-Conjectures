To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The provided description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the problem, we have the following priors:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without any specific evidence suggesting that the description fits one group more than the other, we assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). If we assume these probabilities are equal, then:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

The equation simplifies to:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75\]

As a result, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:

\[ \boxed{\{ "probability": "0.75" \}} \]
