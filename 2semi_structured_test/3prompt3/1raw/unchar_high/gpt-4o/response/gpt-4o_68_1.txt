To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that the description is about a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the description is about a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description, given that it is about a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description, given that it is about a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given the data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Thus:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, we note that the base rates are enough if we assume that the descriptions are equally likely to come from either group (i.e., \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \)). This equal likelihood assumption simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since Jason's description does not favor either group (i.e., high ability, strong motivation, well-liked), we assume the probabilities \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equal. Therefore, using the base rates:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
