To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \(P(A)\), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The number of humanities professors is 25, so \(P(A')\), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Since we do not have any specific information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors based solely on the description, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A') \]

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A') \times P(A') \]

Since \(P(B|A) = P(B|A')\), letâ€™s denote it as \(P(B|D)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|D) \times P(A) + P(B|D) \times P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|D) \times (P(A) + P(A')) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|D) \times 1 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|D) \]

Therefore, we arrive at:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|D)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|D) \times 0.75}{P(B|D)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
