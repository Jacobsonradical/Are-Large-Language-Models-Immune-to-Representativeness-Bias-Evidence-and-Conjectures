Let's start by determining the prior probabilities from the sample sizes. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Thus, the probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:

P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

And the probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:

P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Given the description of Jason, we need to update these priors based on the likelihood of such a description given someone's field. Since we have no specific information about how likely this description is in each field (no additional data differentiating the likelihood of the description for the two groups), we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

Therefore, given no further data, the likelihood of such a description for computer science professors P(description | CS) and for humanities professors P(description | H) can be considered equal. This means the description does not provide additional discriminative power between the two groups.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(CS | description) = [P(description | CS) * P(CS)] / P(description)

Since P(description | CS) and P(description | H) are assumed equal and P(description) is a common factor:
P(CS | description) = P(CS)

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
