To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the necessary components for this calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)).
   - Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)).

Without specific likelihood values, it is often reasonable to assume that the personality traits described in Jason's profile (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) are equally likely for professors in both fields. This translates to \(P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)\).

3. **Posterior Probability** (using Bayes' Theorem):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Given \(P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)\), these terms cancel out, resulting in:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Thus:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
