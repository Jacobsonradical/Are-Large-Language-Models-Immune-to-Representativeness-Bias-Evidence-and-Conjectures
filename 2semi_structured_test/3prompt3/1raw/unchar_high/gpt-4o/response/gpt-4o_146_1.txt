To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

We want to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, since we do not have specific probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we will assume these descriptions are equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, as no additional distinguishing factors were mentioned in their description.

### Prior Probabilities:

1. **Total Computer Science Professors**: 75
2. **Total Humanities Professors**: 25
3. **Total Professors in Sample**: 100

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (prior):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (prior):
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Likelihood:

Given that the description is equally likely for both groups:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \)

Since \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), we can make the following simplification:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given this simplification, \( P(CS|D) \) will primarily be influenced by the prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \).

### Posterior Probability:

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem (considering equal likelihood):
\[ P(CS|D) \approx P(CS) \]
  
Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \boxed{0.75} \]
