To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- We need to find \(P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(\text{H}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- We'd assume, in absence of other specific information differentiating computer science and humanities professors based on the given description, that \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{H})\).

Since Jasonâ€™s description does not include any specific distinguishing information that favors either computer science or humanities professors, we can assume:

\[ P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{description} \mid \text{H}) \]

Therefore, \( P(\text{description}) \) can be simplified considering it as being equal for both groups and thus cancels out in the calculation, simplifying our understanding to just the prior distribution:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) \approx \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
