To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our previous beliefs (priors) with new evidence (likelihoods) to form a new belief (posterior).

Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (HUM).
- We have one description from a total of 100 descriptions.

We seek \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine the components on the right-hand side:

1. \( P(C) \), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(D | C) \), the likelihood of receiving Jason's description given he is a computer science professor:
Since we don't have specific likelihoods given for how descriptions are generated, we assume that the descriptions are equally likely to describe a computer science or humanities professor. Thus, we assume \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \).

4. \( P(D | H) \), the likelihood of receiving Jason's description given he is a humanities professor:
Similarly, this assumes \( P(D | H) = P(D | C) \).

5. \( P(D) \), the total probability of Jasonâ€™s description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

With the assumptions of equal likelihoods, \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \), this term cancels out:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Combining the components and considering the equal likelihood assumption,

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.75}{1.0} \]

\[ P(C | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
