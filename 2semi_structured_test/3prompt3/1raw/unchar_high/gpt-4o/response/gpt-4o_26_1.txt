To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description matches Jason.

We want to determine \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).

By Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's determine the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)).

Next, we need the probability of the description \( B \) given \( A \):
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that Jason (a computer science professor) fits the description.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability that Jason (a humanities professor) fits the description.

Since we lack specific information about the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we can assume they are equally likely if we consider the description to be non-discriminatory.

Thus, we assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Given that assumption, the description does not provide additional information that favors one group over another, so we use the base rates directly.

Finally:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
