To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

For this calculation:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complementary Event, \( \overline{A} \):**
   - This is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( P(\overline{A}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \):**
   - This is a bit trickier because we need to factor in the likelihood of the description for both computer science and humanities professors.
   - However, without specific likelihood values for descriptions provided, we assume:
     - \( P(B|A) = P(B|\overline{A}) = \textrm{an average likelihood} \).
   - If we assume equality for simplicity's sake (as we lack specifics), the total probability \( P(B) \) simplifies.

Since we assume equal descriptive likelihood:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\overline{A}) \cdot P(\overline{A}) \]

Assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|\overline{A}) \):

\[ P(B) = x \cdot 0.75 + x \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = x \] (the same average likelihood applied)

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(A|B) \):**

From Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

So, given no additional specific likelihood values differing by field, the posterior assumes the prior directly.

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
