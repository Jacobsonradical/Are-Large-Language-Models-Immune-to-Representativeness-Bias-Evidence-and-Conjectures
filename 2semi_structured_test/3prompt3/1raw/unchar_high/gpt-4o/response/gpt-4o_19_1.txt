To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem combines the prior probability with the likelihood of the observed data to update beliefs.

The prior probabilities are based on the number of professors in each field:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided does not strongly differentiate between the two groups, we can assume that the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) of Jason fitting this description given that he is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|Hum) \) of Jason fitting this description given that he is a humanities professor might be considered equal for the sake of updating our priors using Bayes' theorem correctly, meaning:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \]

Thus, the description does not update our priors, and our posterior probabilities are the same as our prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) are taken as equal, the denominators just cancel out, leaving us with our prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus,

\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
