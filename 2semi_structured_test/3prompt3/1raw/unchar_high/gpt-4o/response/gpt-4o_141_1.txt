Based on the information given, we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, which means the prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We are given Jason's description but no explicit information that would strongly differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. Attributes such as being highly able, strongly motivated, well-liked, and enjoying a positive professional reputation are likely to be common among successful individuals in both fields. Therefore, these traits do not strongly favor one group over the other.

Given the absence of any strong differential evidence, we can use the prior probability as our posterior probability.

\[ P(CS | Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
 
{"probability": "0.75"}
