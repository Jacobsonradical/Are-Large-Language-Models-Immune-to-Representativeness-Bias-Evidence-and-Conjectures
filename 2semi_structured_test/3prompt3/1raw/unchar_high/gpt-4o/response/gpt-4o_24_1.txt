Given the information and the need to use Bayesian inference, we start by considering the prior probabilities and the likelihoods with respect to the description.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability a professor chosen at random is from Computer Science (CSC): \( P(\text{CSC}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability a professor chosen at random is from Humanities (HUM): \( P(\text{HUM}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Given the description, we need to estimate how likely it is that a professor fitting the description belongs to each field. Without additional specific details suggesting otherwise, we may assume that traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked might be equally likely across both disciplines. Thus,
     - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CSC}) \approx P(\text{description} | \text{HUM}) \)

3. **Posterior probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CSC} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CSC}) \cdot P(\text{CSC})}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Given the likelihoods are similar, the posterior probability mainly reflects the prior probabilities. Therefore:

\[
P(\text{CSC} | \text{description}) \approx \frac{P(\text{CSC})}{P(\text{CSC}) + P(\text{HUM})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, considering the high prior probability and the assumption of roughly equal likelihood, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{{"probability"}} = "0.75"
\]
