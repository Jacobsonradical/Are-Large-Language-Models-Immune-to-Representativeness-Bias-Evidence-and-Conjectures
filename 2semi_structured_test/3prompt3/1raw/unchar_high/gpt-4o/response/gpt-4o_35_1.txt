To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) denote the event that he is a humanities professor. We are given the following:

1. The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(C) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
2. The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We assume the description provided does not give specific distinguishing information that favors either group over the other because no characteristics exclusive to one group are mentioned. This assumption leads us to treat the observed data as equally likely under both prior probabilities. Thus, the likelihoods \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \) can be considered equal.

To find the posterior probability \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \), we can use the formula:
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) can be broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \), it simplifies the numerator and denominator equally. Thus, the individual conditional probability \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) will cancel out:
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
