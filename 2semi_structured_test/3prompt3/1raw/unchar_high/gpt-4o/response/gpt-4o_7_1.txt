To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) = event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) = the given description of Jason.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor \( P(C) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description does not particularly favor either group, we might assume that the likelihood of this description given either event is similar. That means \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups and can be written in terms of the given probabilities:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Given that \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|C) \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
