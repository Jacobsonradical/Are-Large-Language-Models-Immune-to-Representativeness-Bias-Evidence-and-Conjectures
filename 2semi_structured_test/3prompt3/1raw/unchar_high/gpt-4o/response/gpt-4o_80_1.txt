To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of seeing Jason's description.

We'll use the information provided:

- The number of computer science professors ( \( n_{CS} \) ) = 75
- The number of humanities professors ( \( n_{H} \) ) = 25
- The total number of professors ( \( n_{total} \) ) = 100

So the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \) = \( \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{total}} \) = \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75
- \( P(A_{H}) \) = \( \frac{n_{H}}{n_{total}} \) = \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25

Next, we consider the similarity or likelihood of Jason’s description \( B \) among computer science and humanities professors. Since the description provided is relatively neutral and doesn't give specific details leaning towards either field, we will assume that it is equally likely to describe a successful professor in either domain. Thus, we have:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) ≈ \( P(B|A_{H}) \)

Consequently, the likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) would approximately cancel each other out in the Bayes' theorem equation, meaning we can focus on the priors.

So the posterior probability \( P(A_{CS}|B) \) is:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{H}) \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_{H})} \]

Since \( P(A_{CS}) = 0.75 \) and \( P(A_{H}) = 0.25 \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.75 \]

Thus, based on the given information and assumption of equal likelihood, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
