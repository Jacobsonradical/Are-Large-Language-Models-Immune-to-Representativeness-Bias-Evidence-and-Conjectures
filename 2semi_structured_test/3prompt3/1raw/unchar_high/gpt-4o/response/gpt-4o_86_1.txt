Given the information from the study and the unbiased selection of Jason's description, we need to update our initial probabilities (prior probabilities) based on Bayes' theorem.

We initially know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability \(P(CS)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description of Jason does not contain any specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors (e.g., field-specific characteristics). Given this neutrality, we would regard the description as equally likely to appear in both groups.

Because the description does not favor either group, the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is from either group is the same. This means that:
- \(P(\text{description} | CS)\) is equal to \(P(\text{description} | H)\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \(P(\text{description})\) is the same regardless of Jason's group, we simplify this to:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the same as the prior probability. Here is the probability in the requested format:
