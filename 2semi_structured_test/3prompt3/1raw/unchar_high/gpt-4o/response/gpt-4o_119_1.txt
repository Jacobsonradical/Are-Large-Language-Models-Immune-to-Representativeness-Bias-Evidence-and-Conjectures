To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (P(CS|D)), we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that someone is a computer science professor in the sample.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming that the description does not provide additional detailed information that allows us to differentiate between the two groups (i.e., the description is equally likely for both groups), we approximate that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \). If the description does not favor either group, we assume a rational neutral stance:

\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

Therefore, since the description does not give us grounds to favor one group over the other:

\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \approx P(D) \]

Consequently, Bayes' Theorem simplifies in this context:

\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
