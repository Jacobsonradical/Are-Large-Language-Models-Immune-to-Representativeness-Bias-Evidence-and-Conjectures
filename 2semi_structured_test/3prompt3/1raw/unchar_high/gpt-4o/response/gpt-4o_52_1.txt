To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that A is true given that B is true.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that B is true given that A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that A is true.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability that B is true.

In this context:
- A is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- B is the description given for Jason.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \).

First, let's assign the values:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

So,

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, since we do not have specific data to suggest that the description of Jason is more or less likely to describe a person from either discipline, we assume that the likelihood of the description is the same for computer science professors and humanities professors. This simplifies to:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Since we lack more detailed information to favor one over the other for this specific description, we use the proportions of the groups.

Then Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
