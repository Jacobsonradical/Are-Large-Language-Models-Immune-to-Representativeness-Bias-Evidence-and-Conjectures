To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how to break it down:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Given the description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation), we need to estimate whether this description is more likely for CS professors or humanities professors. However, since the description provided does not offer clear distinguishing features specific to either field, we can assume that the likelihood is roughly equal for both groups. Therefore, we can set the likelihoods to be equal.

3. **Posterior probability calculation**:
   By Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \(D\) is the description given.

   Since the description is equally likely among both groups:
   \[
   P(D | CS) = P(D | Humanities)
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)} = \frac{P(CS)}{1} = P(CS) = 0.75
   \]

Given this, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.75\).

Therefore, the answer is:
