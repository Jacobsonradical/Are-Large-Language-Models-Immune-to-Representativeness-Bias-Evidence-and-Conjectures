To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we want to update our prior beliefs based on the description of Jason.

First, let's establish our prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (prior probability \(P(\text{H})\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Let's denote:
- \(E\): The event that the description matches Jason.
- \(\text{CS}\): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(\text{H}\): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \(P(\text{CS} \mid E)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

We also need to determine \(P(E)\), the total probability of the event:
\[
P(E) = P(E \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
\]

If we assume that the descriptions are equally likely to come from computer science and humanities professors, we can say \(P(E \mid \text{CS}) = P(E \mid \text{H})\). For simplicity, assume they cancel each other out in the equation.

Thus, the formula reduces to:
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
\]

Since:
\[
P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \quad \text{and} \quad P(\text{H}) = 0.25
\]

Then:
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75
\]

So, given no detailed information that would favor one field over the other based on the description:
\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
