To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our target).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's assign these probabilities based on the given information:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\):**
   There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \(P(\neg A)\):**
   There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):**
   Without specific information suggesting that the description is more likely to fit a computer science professor over a humanities professor or vice versa, we can assume that the description is equally likely given either category. Therefore:
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

4. **Total Probability \(P(B)\):**
   This is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
