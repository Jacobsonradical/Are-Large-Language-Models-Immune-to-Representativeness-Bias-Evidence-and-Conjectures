To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, I can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we need to find:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) \]

Bayes' theorem can be written as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

However, since we have no explicit information indicating that the description is more likely to fit one group than the other, we can reasonably assume:

\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \]

We can simplify the problem by comparing the prior probabilities, which are:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Using these priors, our posterior probability becomes:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Since we assume no difference in the likelihood of the description given either group, the prior probabilities dominate. Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the same as the prior probability.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
