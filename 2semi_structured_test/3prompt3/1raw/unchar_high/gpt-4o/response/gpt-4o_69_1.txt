Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability that Jason is from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description provided, however, does not give specific details that make it more or less likely that Jason is from either computer science or humanities based on known stereotypes or additional details. Therefore, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, we should rely on the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample remains:

{"probability": "0.75"}
