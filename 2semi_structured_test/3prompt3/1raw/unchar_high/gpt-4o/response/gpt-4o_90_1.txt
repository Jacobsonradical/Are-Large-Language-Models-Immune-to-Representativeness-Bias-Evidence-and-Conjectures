To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description among all professors.

For our problem:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event corresponding to Jason's description.

We need the following:
- \( P(A) \) = the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the description given doesn't favor one group over the other, we can set \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \). Therefore, we can reason that:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) \approx c \cdot 0.75 + c \cdot 0.25 = c \]

where \( c \) is a constant probability proportional to B. Thus, \( c \) will cancel out in the Bayes' formula, simplifying our calculation to just focusing on the priors:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
