To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the description provided.

Initially, the probabilities are based on the sample sizes:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the total number of professors is 75 + 25 = 100.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description does not strongly suggest one field over the other; it is equally likely for a computer science professor or a humanities professor to have high ability, strong motivation, and be well-liked by colleagues.

Therefore, given the description, the likelihood of Jason being from either group does not change from the prior probabilities. 

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:
\[ P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
