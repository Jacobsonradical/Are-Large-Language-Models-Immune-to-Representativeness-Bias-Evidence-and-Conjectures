To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Here, we are given:
- The prior probabilities: P(CS) = the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, and P(H) = the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group.
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

We also know that Jason has been randomly selected, and we need to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer scientist given the description.

Since the description provided does not inherently favor one group over another (itâ€™s equally likely to describe any successful professor in the sample), we assume that each professor's description was randomly chosen from their respective groups and that the likelihood of each description given the group is equal. Thus, we treat the likelihoods as equal for simplicity.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- P(CS|D) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- P(D|CS) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- P(CS) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D) is the total probability of Jason's description (combined probability over both fields).

With the assumption that the likelihoods P(D|CS) and P(D|H) are equal, we can denote them as "L" which cancels out in the fraction due to symmetry.

Thus:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{L \times P(CS)}{L \times P(CS) + L \times P(H)} \]

Simplifying gives us:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
