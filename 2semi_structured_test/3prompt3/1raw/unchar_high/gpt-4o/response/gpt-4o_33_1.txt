To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 100 professors in total: 75 in computer science and 25 in humanities.
- We don't have specific differentiating traits for computer science versus humanities professors in the description, so we'll assume the description applies equally to all professors.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Since we are assuming the description applies equally, \( P(B|A) = 1 \).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of seeing the description. Again under the assumption, \( P(B) = 1 \).

Thus, simplifying:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
