To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description regardless of the discipline.

First, letâ€™s determine the prior probabilities:
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider \( P(B|A) \), the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is a professor in either field. Based on the description alone, and without additional evidence suggesting that one field is more likely than the other to fit Jason's characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation), we assume these characteristics are equally likely to be found in both groups.

Thus:
\[ P(B|\text{CS}) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities}) \]

Using those assumptions, Bayes' theorem simplifies because \( P(B|CS) = P(B|\text{Humanities}) \). So our formula reduces to comparing the priors:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
