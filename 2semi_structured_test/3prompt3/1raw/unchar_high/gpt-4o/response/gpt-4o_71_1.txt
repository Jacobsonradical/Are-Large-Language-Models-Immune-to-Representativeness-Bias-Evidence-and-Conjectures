To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem updates the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- 75 are from computer science (CS) and 25 are from humanities.

Prior probability (\( P(CS) \)): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability (\( P(Hum) \)): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities.
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the event of receiving a description like Jason's.
- \( P(E | CS) \) as the probability of receiving Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | Hum) \) as the probability of receiving Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since the description provided does not favor one group over the other (no specific markers tied to either discipline), we can assume:
\[ P(E | CS) \approx P(E | Hum) \]

Thus, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \times P(CS) + P(E | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Given that \( P(E | CS) \approx P(E | Hum) \):
\[ P(E) \approx P(E | CS) \times (P(CS) + P(Hum)) \]

But:
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(E | CS) \times (P(CS) + P(Hum))} \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS | E) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
