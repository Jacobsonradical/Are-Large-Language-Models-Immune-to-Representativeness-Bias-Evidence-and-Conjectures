Given that we have a description of Jason, we need to update our probability of Jason being a computer science professor based on the information provided.

Starting with the prior probabilities, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, resulting in a base rate (prior) of:
- Computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description provided about Jason, there's no specific trait that strongly indicates a preference towards one group over another. The description includes common positive traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, which are fairly general and do not provide significant evidence to favor one group over the other.

Therefore, our posterior probability, given this neutral description, should be heavily influenced by the prior probabilities.

Thus, the most reasonable estimate for the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is roughly equal to the prior probability.
