To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, we need the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: This would be the probability of observing the description of Jason given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \), and given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(D | Hum) \). Without specific details distinguishing computer science and humanities professors based on the description, we assume these probabilities are equal. 

Given:
   - \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \)

By Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both the computer science and humanities cases, it cancels out:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Given \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = 0.25 \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.75"}
