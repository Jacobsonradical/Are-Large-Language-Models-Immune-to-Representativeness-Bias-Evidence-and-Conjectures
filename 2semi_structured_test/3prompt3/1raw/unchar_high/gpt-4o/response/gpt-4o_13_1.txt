To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let’s recap:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason is sampled from these 100 professors.

We need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. This can be computed using Bayes’ Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's assume, realistically, that the description provided does not better fit one group over the other, implying that \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Humanities) \).

Since there is no information to suggest otherwise, we assume that Jason's description is equally likely for both groups of professors:

- \( P(D | CS) = k \)
- \( P(D | Humanities) = k \)

Where \( k \) is some common probability factor. This lets us simplify the equation since \( P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(Humanities) \).

Given the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Thus, 

\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(Humanities) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

This simplifies the equation to:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is 0.75.

Thus, the answer is:
