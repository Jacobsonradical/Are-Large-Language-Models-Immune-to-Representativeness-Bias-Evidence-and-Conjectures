To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Firstly, we need to identify the prior probabilities:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we have no specific information in the description of Jason that differentiates between computer science professors and humanities professors, we assume that the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either field. That is, the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is in either group is the same. Thus:

- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(Desc | CS) = 1 \)
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(Desc | Hum) = 1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
