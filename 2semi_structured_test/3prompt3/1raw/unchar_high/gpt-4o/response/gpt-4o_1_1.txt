To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that the professor is in computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that the professor is in the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Since the description does not seem to provide any specific information that would point more strongly towards computer science or humanities (traits described like high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation can be present in both fields), we assume equal likelihoods for both groups.
   - Let \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) be the probabilities of the description given the professor is from computer science or humanities, respectively.
   - Assuming these are equal, we have \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \).

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - \( P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \)
   - However, since \( P(D) \) is the same for both and equal likelihoods \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \) cancel out each other, we focus on the priors.

Given this, the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \) simplifies to the prior probability \( P(CS) \), which is:
