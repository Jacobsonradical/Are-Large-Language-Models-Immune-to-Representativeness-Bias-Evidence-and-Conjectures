To solve this problem, you need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. We can use Bayes' theorem for this calculation. 

Bayes' theorem formula is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability Jason is in computer science given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) = The given description.

We need to find:
\[ P(A|B) \]

From the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without specific information on how likely the given description is for computer science vs. humanities professors (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)), we can make a reasonable assumption based on the description. The description suggests attributes more commonly associated with someone in the humanities (creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a lack of technical inclination). Therefore, we might guess that:
- \( P(B|A) \) is lower (professors in computer science would less likely have these traits).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher (professors in humanities would more likely have these traits).

Suppose we assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \)

Then, the marginal probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description is:
