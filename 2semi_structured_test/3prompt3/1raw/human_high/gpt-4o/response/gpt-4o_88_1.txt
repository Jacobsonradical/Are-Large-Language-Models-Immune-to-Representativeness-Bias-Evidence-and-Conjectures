To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the necessary terms for Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|¬A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., a humanities professor).
- \( P(¬A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(¬A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider whether the description is more likely for a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason includes traits like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more with the general stereotype of humanities professors.

To proceed, let's assign probabilities to the likely descriptions:

- Suppose \( P(B|A) \) (description given computer science professor) is relatively lower, say 0.2.
- Suppose \( P(B|¬A) \) (description given humanities professor) is relatively higher, say 0.8.

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description provided is approximately:
