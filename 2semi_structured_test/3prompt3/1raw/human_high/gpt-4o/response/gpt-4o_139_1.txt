To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of a randomly chosen professor being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   The likelihood is the probability that a professor with Jason's description belongs to each field:
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \)
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \)

   Based on the description given of Jason, it seems more aligned with a humanities professor due to attributes like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are typically more associated with humanities.

   Let's assign some qualitative likelihoods:
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \): This might be lower because the description does not align closely with typical computer science professors. Let's suppose this is 0.2.
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \): This is higher as the description aligns well with attributes often associated with humanities professors. Let's suppose this is 0.8.

3. **Application of Bayes' Theorem:**

   Bayes' theorem formula is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description, and can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

   Now, we calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

\[
\text{{Final answer: }} {"probability": "0.4286"}
\]
