To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, since we are given a non-technical, humanities-inclined description, it might be helpful to use our understanding of the base rates and the description's indication towards humanities over computer science.

First, let’s consider the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.

So, the base rate (prior probability) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the base rate (prior probability) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we interpret the description of Jason:
- Creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, but not particularly technical.

These traits are more indicative of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. While we don't have exact likelihoods, we can reasonably estimate that such a description is more likely to fit a humanities professor. Let’s assume:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \):
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \), the total probability of the description, is:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
\]
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Thus,
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{\{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\}}
\]
