To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the following:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability (P(C) and P(H))**:
   - The probability of randomly choosing a computer science professor: \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability of randomly choosing a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(D | C) and P(D | H))**:
   - To estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), let's consider that the description tends to fit a humanities professor better than a computer science professor. "Creative," "imaginative," and "emotionally driven" traits are more stereotypical of humanities than computer science, which tends to be associated with technical skill.
   - For simplicity, we might estimate \( P(D | C) \approx 0.2 \) and \( P(D | H) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **Total Probability (P(D))**:
   - \( P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.35 \)

4. **Posterior Probability (P(C | D))**:
   - \( P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(C | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(C | D) \approx 0.4286 \)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.43" \} \]
