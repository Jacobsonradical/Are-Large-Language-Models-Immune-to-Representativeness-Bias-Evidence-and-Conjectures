Given the data, we'd start with the proportion of computer science professors relative to the total:

\[
\text{Prior probability of computer science professor} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

\[
\text{Prior probability of humanities professor} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

However, the description suggests certain traits that seem more aligned with the humanities than computer science. Specifically, "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical" are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors.

To quantify this, we can apply Bayes' theorem, but we need to estimate the likelihood of the described traits given each profession.

Let's denote:
- \(P(\text{CS})\) as the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is 0.75.
- \(P(\text{Hum})\) as the prior probability of being a humanities professor, which is 0.25.
- \(P(D | \text{CS})\) as the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | \text{Hum})\) as the likelihood of the description given that he is a humanities professor.

We can assume \(P(D | \text{CS})\) is relatively low because the traits do not fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. Let's hypothetically assign it a value of 0.1.

For \(P(D | \text{Hum})\), we assume the fit is better, so letâ€™s assign it a value of 0.6.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

And \(P(D)\) can be computed through the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
= (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.6 \cdot 0.25)
= 0.075 + 0.15
= 0.225
\]

So,

\[
P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.333.

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: \text{"0.333"}\}
\]
