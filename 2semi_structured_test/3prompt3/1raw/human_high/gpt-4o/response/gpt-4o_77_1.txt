To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Given:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor \(= \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \(= \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

Let:
- \( CS \) represent being a computer science professor
- \( H \) represent being a humanities professor

We are looking for \( P(CS \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Here, \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

To compute \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we'll make assumptions. Given the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor due to his non-technical and creative traits. Let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.2 \) (since he doesn’t seem to fit the typical technical profile of a computer science professor)
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.8 \) (since he fits better with the profile of a humanities professor)

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
