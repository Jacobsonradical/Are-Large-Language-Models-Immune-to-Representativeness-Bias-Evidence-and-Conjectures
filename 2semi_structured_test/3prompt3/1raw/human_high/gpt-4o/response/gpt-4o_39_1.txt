To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the given description.

First, we calculate the prior probability, which is the base rate of each group in the sample:
- Probability of picking a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of picking a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description given each group. Given the description, it seems more aligned with typical traits we might associate with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's assume the following likelihoods (these are subjective assumptions based on the description):
- \(P(D \mid H)\) (Probability of the description given humanities) = 0.9
- \(P(D \mid CS)\) (Probability of the description given computer science) = 0.1

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
