To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the described characteristics.

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to know:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the characteristics if Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the characteristics (normalizing factor).

First, calculate the prior probability, \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, calculate the prior probability, \( P(A^c) \), that Jason is a humanities professor:
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), let's make some reasonable assumptions based on the description:
- Jason is described as creatively and emotionally driven, with interests in traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical. This profile appears more closely aligned with humanities than with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor.

If we assume that P(B|A) is low (since the description does not fit the typical stereotype of a computer science professor) and P(B|A^c) is high (since it fits the stereotypical stereotype of a humanities professor), we might estimate:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming a small proportion of computer science professors fit this description).
- \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.8 \) (assuming a significant proportion of humanities professors fit this description).

Now, calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.43 \).
