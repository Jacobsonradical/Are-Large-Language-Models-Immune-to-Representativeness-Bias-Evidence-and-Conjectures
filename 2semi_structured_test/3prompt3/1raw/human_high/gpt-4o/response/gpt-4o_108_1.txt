To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( C \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) is the description that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's break down each component:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

The priors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we evaluate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description and the typical stereotypes (while acknowledging they might not be fully accurate), Jason's characteristics seem more aligned with the humanities professors:

- \( P(D|C) \): Likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(D|H) \): Likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description.

Since Jason is described as not particularly technical, emotionally driven, imaginative, and creative, this aligns more stereotypically with the humanities professors. Let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.9 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
