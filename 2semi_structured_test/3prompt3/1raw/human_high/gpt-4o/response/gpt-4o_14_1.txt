To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}, \]
where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that A is true given that B is true.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that B is true given that A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the probability that A is true.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability that B is true.

Let's define the events:
- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): The description provided is Jason's description.

Given the problem description, we can derive the following:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so \(P(A_\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) and \(P(A_\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We need to estimate \(P(B|A_\text{CS})\) and \(P(B|A_\text{H})\), the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

Given the description of Jason—creativity, imagination, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and not particularly technical—this seems more typical of humanities professors than computer science professors. If we assume the description fits humanities professors much better than computer science professors, we can estimate:
- \(P(B|A_\text{CS}) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(B|A_\text{H}) \approx 0.8\)

Now, let's apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_\text{CS}) \cdot P(A_\text{CS})}{P(B|A_\text{CS}) \cdot P(A_\text{CS}) + P(B|A_\text{H}) \cdot P(A_\text{H})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.43"}
