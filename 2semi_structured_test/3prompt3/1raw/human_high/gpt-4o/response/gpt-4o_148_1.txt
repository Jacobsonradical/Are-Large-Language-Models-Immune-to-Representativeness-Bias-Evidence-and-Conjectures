In this scenario, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on the given description.

Here's a step-by-step process for applying Bayes' theorem in this case:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \((P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof})))\ and given that he is a humanities professor \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum Prof})\).
   - Based on the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not technical), it seems more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities professors, rather than computer science professors. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof})\) is lower than \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum Prof})\).

Let's assume some plausible likelihood values:
   - \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) = 0.1\)
   - \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum Prof}) = 0.9\)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum Prof}) \cdot P(\text{Hum Prof}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.75)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
