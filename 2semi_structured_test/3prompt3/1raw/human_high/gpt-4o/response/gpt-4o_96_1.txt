To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that we get Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

We need to determine each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the pool of 100 professors.
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor from the pool of 100 professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.
   - Thus, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
   - Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate. Not particularly technical.
   - Based on common stereotypes and general characteristics, these traits lean more towards someone in the humanities. Therefore, we might assign this a lower value.
   - Let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor.
   - The description fits humanities professors better.
   - Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - This is the overall probability of Jason’s description.
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \).
   - \( P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \).
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.
