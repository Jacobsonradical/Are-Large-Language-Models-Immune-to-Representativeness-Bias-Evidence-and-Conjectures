First, let's consider the prior probabilities of Jason being from each group. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, out of a total of 100 professors.

```
Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25 / 100 = 0.25
```

Next, based on the description provided, we must evaluate the likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a typical computer science professor or a humanities professor. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical. These traits are generally more closely associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Let's denote the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor as \( P(D|CS) \) and given he is a humanities professor as \( P(D|H) \).

Assuming Jason's description has a higher likelihood of being a humanities professor, we can assign:

```
P(D|CS) ≈ 0.2 (assuming a lower fit)
P(D|H) ≈ 0.8 (assuming a higher fit)
```

Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we have:

```
P(CS|D) = (P(D|CS) * P(CS)) / (P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H))
```

Plugging the values in:

```
P(CS|D) = (0.2 * 0.75) / (0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25)
        ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2)
        ≈ 0.15 / 0.35
        ≈ 0.4286
```

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.429.
