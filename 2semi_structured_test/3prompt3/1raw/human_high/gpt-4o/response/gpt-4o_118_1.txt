Given the problem, we need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided. We will use Bayes' theorem to do this.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event of being a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event matching the description provided.

First, let's break down each component needed for Bayes' theorem:

1. **\(P(A)\): The prior probability of being a computer science professor.**
   Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **\(P(B | A)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science.**
   This is more difficult to estimate directly, but we can infer from the description that Jason seems less likely to be technical:
   \(P(B | A)\) could be relatively low.

3. **\(P(B | \neg A)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.**
   Given the traits of creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of technical focus, Jason fits more closely with the characteristics typically associated with humanities professors:
   \(P(B | \neg A)\) could be relatively high.

4. **\(P(\neg A)\): The prior probability of being a humanities professor.**
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

5. **\(P(B)\): The overall probability of the description, which can be derived from the law of total probability:**
   \[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Now, let's make a reasonable assumption about \(P(B | A)\) and \(P(B | \neg A)\):
- Let's assume \(P(B | A) = 0.2\)
- Let's assume \(P(B | \neg A) = 0.8\)

Given these assumptions:

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now putting these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.4286\).

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
