To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's consider the base rates:  
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the given description for a professor from each group. Based on the description:

- Traits such as "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" suggest that Jason is more likely to align with the profile of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, where technical skills are typically more pronounced.

For the sake of estimation, let's assume:
- The probability of receiving such a description if Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D \mid \text{Hum}) \), is relatively high. We can estimate this as 0.8.
- The probability of receiving such a description if Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \), is relatively low, let's say 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS} \mid D) \):

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

\( P(D) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D \mid \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Thus,

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
