To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Prior probability:
- P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

We also need to determine the likelihood of the description given either profession. The description suggests a person who is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical," which may be more characteristic of humanities professors than computer science professors. However, without explicit likelihood values, we can only make reasonable assumptions.

Let's assume the likelihood that a humanities professor fits Jason's description is P(D|H) = 0.8 and for a computer science professor P(D|CS) = 0.2, based on the general notion that the description fits more closely with traits typically associated with humanities scholars.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]
