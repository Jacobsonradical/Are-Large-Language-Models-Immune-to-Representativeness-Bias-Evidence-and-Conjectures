To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, comprising a total of 100 professors.
- Jason has certain traits described that need to be evaluated to estimate this probability.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood of Description Given Computer Science, \( P(B | A) \):**
   This is subjective due to the characteristics given. Jason’s attributes such as being "not particularly technical" may make us lean towards him being a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume that the probability of having those characteristics in a computer science professor is quite low, say 0.1. However, this part is highly subjective.

3. **Likelihood of Description Given Humanities, \( P(B | A_2) \):**
   With \( A_2 \) being that Jason is a humanities professor.
   Given Jason's description matches more closely with humanities, assume this probability is higher, say 0.7. 

4. **Prior Probability of Being a Humanities Professor, \( P(A_2) \):**
   \[ P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | A_2) * P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 * 0.75) + (0.7 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.1 * 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
