Given the information provided, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

Let's define the events:
- \( A = \) Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B = \) Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D = \) Description matches Jason

We need to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \)

First, calculate the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100.
- Hence, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \). The description matches traits commonly associated with humanities more closely than with computer science (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, exploring passions, not particularly technical). 

Letâ€™s assume subjectively:
- \( P(D|A) \) is relatively low. For the sake of argument, let us assume \( P(D|A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|B) \) is relatively high. Let us assume \( P(D|B) = 0.8 \)

Using total probability \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.428 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.428.
