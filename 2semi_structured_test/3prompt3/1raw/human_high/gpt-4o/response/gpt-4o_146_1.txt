Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description provided.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of a person with Jason's description being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \)) and the likelihood of a person with Jason's description being a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)).

Given Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," it suggests traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors who are typically more technical.

To simplify things:
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = 0.1 \)
   - And \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Total Probability of the Description**:
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \)

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem: \( P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \)
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
