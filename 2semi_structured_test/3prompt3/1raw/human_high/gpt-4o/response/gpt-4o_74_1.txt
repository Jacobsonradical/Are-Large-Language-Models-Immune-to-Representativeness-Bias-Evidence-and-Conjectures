To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The relevant numbers and information are as follows:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Without specific statistical details on how well the description matches these two groups, we'll need to make some qualitative assumptions. Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, we might subjectively assess that he fits the stereotype of a humanities professor more closely than a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem is calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall likelihood of the description.

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For humanities professors \( P(\text{H}) \):

\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

If we consider the subjective likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor more than a computer science professor, assume:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood for a non-technical, creative description matching a CS professor).
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood for the same description matching a humanities professor).

The denominator \( P(\text{Description}) \) combines both:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
