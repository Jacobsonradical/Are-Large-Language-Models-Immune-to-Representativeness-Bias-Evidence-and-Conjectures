To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we need to consider both the prior probability and how well his description matches what we would expect of a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor \(P(CS)\):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor \(P(H)\):
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to evaluate how likely Jason's description fits each group. Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven", "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring", "gifted and passionate", and "not particularly technical." These traits seem to align more closely with the typical perceptions of someone in the humanities rather than computer science, where being technically inclined might be more common.

Let's denote:
- \(P(D | CS)\): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description, it seems more likely to fit someone in the humanities. We can estimate these probabilities qualitatively. Let's assign:
- \(P(D | CS) = 0.2\)
- \(P(D | H) = 0.8\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
where \(P(D)\) is the normalizing constant:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, calculate the posterior probability \(P(CS | D)\):
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
