To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of observing the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of observing the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of observing the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To determine \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not particularly technical), it seems more likely to fit a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (a subjective estimate given that the description doesn't align well with typical stereotypes of computer science professors)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (a subjective estimate given that the description aligns well with typical stereotypes of humanities professors)

The overall probability \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.428 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.428.
