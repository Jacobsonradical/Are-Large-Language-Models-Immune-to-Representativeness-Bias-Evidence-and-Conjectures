To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability that any randomly selected professor is a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - For this specific case, we notice traits such as "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," "gifted and passionate," and "not particularly technical" tend to align more closely with humanities professors than with computer science professors. We will denote this likelihood as:
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \)
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \)

   For simplicity, let us assume:
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) = 0.1 \) (a lower likelihood given the description does not commonly match computer science traits)
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) = 0.9 \) (a higher likelihood given the description closely matches humanities traits)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes' theorem:**

\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where,

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \times P(Hum)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Now, calculate the posterior:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
