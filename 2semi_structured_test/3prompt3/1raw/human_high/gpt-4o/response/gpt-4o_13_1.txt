Given the provided description of Jason, we need to calculate the probability that he is a computer science professor based on Bayesian reasoning. Here is a step-by-step outline of the approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Assess how likely it is to get Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \).
   - Assess how likely it is to get Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \).

   Since specific likelihood values are not given in the problem, we will rely on intuitive judgments about the description provided:
   - Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. This description aligns more closely with common stereotypes of someone in the humanities rather than in computer science.

   Based on this, we might reasonably assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \), reflecting the intuition that the description is less typical of a computer science professor and more typical of a humanities professor.

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286
   \]

Conclusion:
\[
\text{{"probability": "0.4286"}}
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
