To calculate the posterior probability that Jason, given his description, is a computer science professor from the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   The likelihood here is subjective and depends heavily on the description provided. Given Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not technical), these traits might be less typical for computer science professors compared to humanities professors. Let's assume for the sake of this problem that the likelihood ratio favors humanities professors over computer science professors:
   \[ P(B|\text{CS Professor}) = 0.1 \] (since the description less fits the typical technical profile of CS professors)
   \[ P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) = 0.9 \] (assuming such traits are more common among humanities professors)

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \):**
   This can be computed as the weighted sum of the conditional probabilities:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.1) \cdot (0.75) + (0.9) \cdot (0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.75)}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Based on the above calculations:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]

This indicates that given the description of Jason, there is a 25% chance that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
