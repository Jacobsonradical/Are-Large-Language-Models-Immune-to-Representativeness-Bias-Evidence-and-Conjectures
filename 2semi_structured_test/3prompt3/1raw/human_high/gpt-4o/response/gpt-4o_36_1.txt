To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description provided, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula for this case is:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(D | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) \times P(\text{H})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | \text{H}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) is the prior probability of picking a humanities professor.

We need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Based on the description, Jason seems more aligned with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate but not technical). Letâ€™s assume some typical values (these assumptions can be refined with more detailed knowledge of the likelihoods):
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood because the description does not strongly suggest typical computer science traits)
- \( P(D | \text{H}) \approx 0.8 \) (higher likelihood because the description fits the common perceptions of humanities professors)

Now we apply these values to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
