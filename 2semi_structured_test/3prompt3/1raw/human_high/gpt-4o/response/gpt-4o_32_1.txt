To determine the likelihood (posterior probability) that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we will use Bayesian reasoning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess how likely it is for a given description to match a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, is gifted and passionate but not particularly technical.
   - This description seems more representative of a humanities professor.

   Without empirical data on the exact likelihoods or an extra context, we will assume qualitative observations:
   - Assume \(P(description | CS)\) is lower, let's estimate it around 0.2.
   - Assume \(P(description | H)\) is higher, let's estimate it around 0.8.

3. **Bayesian Update**:
   - We use Bayes' theorem to update our probabilities:
     \[
     P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)}
     \]

     Substituting in the values:
     \[
     P(CS | description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)}
     \]

4. **Calculation**:
   - Numerator: \(0.2 \times 0.75 = 0.15\)
   - Denominator: \((0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35\)
     \[
     P(CS | description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
     \]

Thus, based on the given description and using Bayesian updating, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.43.
