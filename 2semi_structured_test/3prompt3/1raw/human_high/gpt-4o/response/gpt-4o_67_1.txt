To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of observing Jason's description.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) : The description provided.

First, we calculate the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). While these are not provided explicitly in the problem statement, we can reason about them based on the description:
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical. These traits might be more common or stereotypical for humanities professors than for computer science professors.

We can make a subjective estimation:
- Suppose \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (since the description fits humanities professors better).
- Suppose \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \).

We can now calculate the marginal probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.3"}} \]
