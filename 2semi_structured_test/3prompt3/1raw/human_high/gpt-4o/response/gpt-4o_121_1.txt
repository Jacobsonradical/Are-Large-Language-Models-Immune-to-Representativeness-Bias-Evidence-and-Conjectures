To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should use Bayes' theorem. Given:

1. The prior probabilities:
   - There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
   - P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. The likelihood:
   - We need to evaluate how likely a description like Jason's would be for both groups. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying reading, traveling, and exploring, not technical. These traits may suggest a lower likelihood of being a computer science professor and a higher likelihood of being a humanities professor. 

Let's assume that descriptive traits such as Jason’s are \( L(CS) \) for computer science professors and \( L(H) \) for humanities professors. Given his non-technical nature and stereotypically more humanities-oriented traits:

- Let’s hypothesize \( L(CS) = 0.4 \) (as creativity is present but not typical absence of technicality)
- Let’s hypothesize \( L(H) = 0.8 \) (a stronger fit given the emotional and imaginative nature highlighted)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) = L(CS) = 0.4 \)
- \( P(D|H) = L(H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(CS) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)

Plugging in:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.4 \times 0.75}{0.4 \times 0.75 + 0.8 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.3}{0.3 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.3}{0.5} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.6"} \]
