To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we have the following:

- Total professors: 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities)
  
Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): The hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{HU} \): The hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(H_{CS} | D) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

First, we calculate the priors:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{HU}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We now need to assess \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(D | H_{HU}) \). Based on the description:

- Jason is "not particularly technical," which is less characteristic of computer science professors and more characteristic of humanities professors.
  
For simplicity, let's assume the following:
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) = 0.1 (a relatively low probability for computer science professors because the description leans towards non-technical, creative traits)
- \( P(D | H_{HU}) \) = 0.9 (a relatively high probability for humanities professors for the same reason)

Now we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{HU}) \cdot P(H_{HU}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.75)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
