Based on the given description of Jason, who is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, but not particularly technical, it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Given this and the prior probabilities (since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), we should update our posterior probability accordingly.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (CS): \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (H): \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, consider how likely Jason's description fits each type of professor:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): The description is not very typical for a computer science professor, so we might assign a lower likelihood, such as 0.1.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \): The description is more typical for a humanities professor, so we might assign a higher likelihood, such as 0.9.

By Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as follows:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

Now compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
