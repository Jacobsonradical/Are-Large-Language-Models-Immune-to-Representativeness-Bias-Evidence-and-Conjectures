To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- Probability of a professor being in computer science (P(CS)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of a professor being in the humanities (P(Hum)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description being typical for a computer science professor (P(Desc|CS)) versus a humanities professor (P(Desc|Hum)). Given the description emphasizing creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, but not being particularly technical, it seems more aligned with the traits commonly associated with humanities professors.

For estimation purposes, let's assume:
- P(Desc|CS) might be lower, say 0.2 (since the description does not fit the stereotypical computer science profile).
- P(Desc|Hum) might be higher, say 0.7 (as the description fits better with the typical humanities profile).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \).

Calculating the denominator \( P(Desc) \):

\[ P(Desc) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325 \]

Now, calculating the numerator:

\[ P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \approx 0.4615 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4615.
