To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

First, let’s establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, let’s consider \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|Hum) \):
- \( P(B|CS) \) is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|Hum) \) is the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

The description of Jason suggests someone more aligned with traits often associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring). Therefore, we might intuitively expect \( P(B|Hum) \) to be higher than \( P(B|CS) \).

Assuming for simplicity (since we need subjective judgment) that:
- \( P(B|CS) = 0.2 \) (since the description is less typical for a CS professor but still possible),
- \( P(B|Hum) = 0.8 \) (since the description fits well with what we expect for a humanities professor).

Then we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
