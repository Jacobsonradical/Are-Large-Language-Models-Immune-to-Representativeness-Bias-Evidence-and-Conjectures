Based on the description provided for Jason, several characteristics such as creativity, passion, enjoyment of traveling, and lack of focus on technical aspects suggest a stronger alignment with the humanities as opposed to computer science. Given this information, we must update our prior beliefs using Bayesian reasoning.

Prior probabilities are given by the distribution of professors in the study:

- Probability(Jason is a computer science professor) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability(Jason is a humanities professor) = 25/100 = 0.25

Considering the description's fit with the profile of a humanities professor, we need to adjust these probabilities.

Let:
- P(D | CS) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D | H) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- P(CS) = Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor = 0.75.
- P(H) = Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor = 0.25

The likelihoods based on the description might be approximated as:
- P(D | CS) (Less likely for this description to match a CS professor)
- P(D | H) (More likely for this description to match a humanities professor)

While exact values of P(D | CS) and P(D | H) are not given, a reasonable assumption might be:
- P(D | CS) = 0.2
- P(D | H) = 0.8

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
where
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.35 \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
