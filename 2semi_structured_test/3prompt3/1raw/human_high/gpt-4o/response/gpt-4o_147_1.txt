Given the information provided and considering Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- The probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability of being a humanities professor (P(Hum)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we need a sense of how likely the description fits each category. Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical), these traits seem more common generally among humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

For the sake of this calculation, we assume two conditional probabilities subjectively:
- The probability that the description fits a computer science professor, P(Desc|CS), is relatively low. Let's assume it is 0.1.
- The probability that the description fits a humanities professor, P(Desc|Hum), is relatively high. Let's assume it is 0.7.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
P(CS|Desc) = [P(Desc|CS) * P(CS)] / [P(Desc|CS) * P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) * P(Hum)]

Plugging in the numbers:
P(CS|Desc) = [0.1 * 0.75] / [0.1 * 0.75 + 0.7 * 0.25]
           = 0.075 / [0.075 + 0.175]
           = 0.075 / 0.25
           = 0.3

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
