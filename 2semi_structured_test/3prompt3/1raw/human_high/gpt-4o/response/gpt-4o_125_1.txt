To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

First, we consider the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100, so \( P(CS) = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100, so \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

We are given a description that seems to match a stereotypical humanities professor more closely than a computer science professor. Given this, we assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Since Jason is described as "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring but not particularly technical," we might assume these traits are more common among humanities professors. While exact probabilities are not given, let's estimate:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (assuming that such a description is somewhat unlikely for a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \) (assuming that such a description is quite likely for a humanities professor).

Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.3 \).

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
