To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities: 

- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \):

Given the description, Jason seems more like someone from the humanities field (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Let's denote \( P(D|CS) \) as being relatively low and \( P(D|Hum) \) as being high due to the nature of the traits described.

We can assume the following for simplicity, but these numbers can be adjusted based on further data or research:

- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (Jason's characteristics are less common among computer science professors)
- \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.8 \) (Jason's characteristics are more common among humanities professors)

The total probability \( P(D) \) can then be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
