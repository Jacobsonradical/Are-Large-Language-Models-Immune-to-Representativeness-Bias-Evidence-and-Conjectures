To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
    - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
    - \( P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \):**
    - Where \( A^c \) is Jason being a humanities professor.
    - \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):**
    - Let's denote \( B \) as the event that the description matches Jason’s personality traits.
    - Based on the description given (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, not technical):
        - The description fits more naturally with a humanities professor than a computer science professor, given typical stereotypes.

For simplicity, let’s assign rough likelihood estimations based on these stereotypes:
- Assume that \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance that a computer science professor fits this description).
- Conversely, \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.8 \) (80% chance that a humanities professor fits this description).

4. **Overall probability \( P(B) \):**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.43.

So, the answer is: {"probability": "0.43"}
