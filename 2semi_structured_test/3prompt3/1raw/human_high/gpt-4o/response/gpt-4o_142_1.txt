To determine the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the base rates and the given description. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Base rates:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the probability of choosing a computer science professor randomly is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of choosing a humanities professor randomly is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood of the description for each group:**
   - The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.
   - Let's assume that the likelihood of such a description for a humanities professor is \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (quite high).
   - Let's assume the likelihood of such a description for a computer science professor is \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (quite low).

3. **Application of Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description among all professors, calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, calculating \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
