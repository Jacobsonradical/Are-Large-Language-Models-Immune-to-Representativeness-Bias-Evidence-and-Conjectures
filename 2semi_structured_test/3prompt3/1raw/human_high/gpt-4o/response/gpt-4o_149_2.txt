To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define our prior probabilities and use the given problem data:

- \( P(CS) = \) Probability Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(Hum) = \) Probability Jason is a humanities professor

Based on the sample size:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a professor in either field:

- \( P(Desc | CS) = \) Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(Desc | Hum) = \) Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits might be more common in the humanities than in computer science. Let's assume reasonable estimates based on stereotypes and common knowledge:

- \( P(Desc | CS) \) might be relatively low, let's say 0.2 (20%)
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) might be relatively high, let's say 0.7 (70%)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

We need \( P(Desc) \):

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325 \]

Now we calculate the posterior:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325} = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \approx 0.4615 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4615.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4615"}
