To answer the question, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's set up the problem:

1. We have two groups: 75 professors in computer science and 25 professors in the humanities.
2. Jason's description will be one of these 100 descriptions chosen at random.
3. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his described characteristics.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason's description.

We need to determine \( P(A|B) \).

From the given data:
- \( P(A) \) or the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) or the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Jason's description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a lack of technicality, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

While we don't have exact probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), let's make reasonable assumptions based on typical personality traits:
- Given that creativity, emotional drive, and a lack of technicality are more common in humanities, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively high, say 0.8.
- Conversely, let's assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low, say 0.2.

Using these assumptions:

- \( P(B) \) combines both descriptions and priors:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
