To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. 

The hypothesis here is:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}|E) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \(E\) (Jason's description).
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (Jason's description).

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H_{H}) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, let's consider the likelihoods:
- Jason's description suggests a strong fit for characteristics often associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).
- However, without specific information on the exact probabilities, let's assume that the likelihood \( P(E|H_{H}) \) (description given humanities professor) is significantly higher than \( P(E|H_{CS}) \) (description given computer science professor).

Given the nature of humanities versus computer science, let's assume:
- \( P(E|H_{H}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.2 \)

Now, we calculate the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
