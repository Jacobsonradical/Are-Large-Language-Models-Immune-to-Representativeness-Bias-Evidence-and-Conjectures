To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which involves updating our prior belief based on the given evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Total probability of the description across both groups.
- \( P(CS|D) \) = Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

We have:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Although there are no exact numbers for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the description of Jason being "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" aligns more stereotypically with traits often associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. For the sake of estimation:

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (low probability, since it's not typically expected for a CS professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.6 \) (higher probability, as it matches the expected profile for humanities)

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.6 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.225} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{3} \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.33.
