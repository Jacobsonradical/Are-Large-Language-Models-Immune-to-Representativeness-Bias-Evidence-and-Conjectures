To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): The description of Jason

From the problem, we have:
- Number of computer science professors, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Number of humanities professors, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), which are the probabilities of Jason's description given his field.

Given the description, Jason seems more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (emotional, creative, passionate). We can reasonably estimate:
- \( P(D | C) \) to be lower, say around 0.2
- \( P(D | H) \) to be higher, say around 0.8

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is given by:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

So,

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
