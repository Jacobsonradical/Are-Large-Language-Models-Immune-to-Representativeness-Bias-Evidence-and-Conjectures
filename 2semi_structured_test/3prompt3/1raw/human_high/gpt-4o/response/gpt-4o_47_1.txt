Let's denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( CS \) and a humanities professor as \( H \).

We are given:
- Prior probability of choosing a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability of choosing a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

However, \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be broken down as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \).

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely to fit the stereotype of a humanities professor due to his creative and imaginative nature, preference for reading, and being emotionally driven rather than technical. Therefore, we will make an educated guess that:

- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.8 \)

Now we can compute \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
