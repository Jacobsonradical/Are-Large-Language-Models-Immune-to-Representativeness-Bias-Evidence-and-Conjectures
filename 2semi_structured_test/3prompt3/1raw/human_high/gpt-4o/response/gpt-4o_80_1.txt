To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, we'll need to consider the likelihood of the description given Jason's field:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more consistent with a humanities professor. However, there is an inherent subjectivity in these estimations, so let's assign what we think are reasonable likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (Assuming less likelihood as computer science is typically considered more technical)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (Assuming higher likelihood as the description fits better with humanities traits)

We need to apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

\( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, is calculated by:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, substituting \( P(D) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
