To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Below are the steps to solve this:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   We need to evaluate the likelihoods of Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor given Jason's description. His description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical) seems to align more with typical traits of professors in the humanities rather than computer science.

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D \mid H) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

   Considering the description, it appears more likely for Jason to be a humanities professor:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) \) could be estimated lower.
   - \( P(D \mid H) \) could be estimated higher.

   For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(D \mid H) = 0.8 \)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

   Now we can find \( P(CS \mid D) \):
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
