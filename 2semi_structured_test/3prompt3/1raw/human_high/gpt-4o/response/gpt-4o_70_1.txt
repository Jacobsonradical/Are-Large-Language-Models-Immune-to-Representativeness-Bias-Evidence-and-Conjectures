To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed personality description of Jason.

Let's break it down with what we know:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Probability, \( P(A^c) \):**
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):**
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Jason's description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and passion, which are characteristics generally less associated with technical fields like computer science. For simplicity, let’s assume the likelihood of such a profile among computer science professors is relatively low. Let's approximate:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \]

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A^c) \):**
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. The description seems to fit better with what one might expect from someone in the humanities. Let’s approximate this likelihood as higher:
   \[ P(B|A^c) \approx 0.7 \]

5. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \):**
   This is found by considering both possible ways Jason's description could occur (as a computer science professor and as a humanities professor):
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.1)(0.75) + (0.7)(0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.1)(0.75)}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.3"}}}
\]
