To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason suggests he is more aligned with the humanities due to his creativity, emotional drive, and lack of technical focus.
   - Letâ€™s assume the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) of such a description for a computer science professor is low. We'll assign an estimated value (e.g., \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)).
   - Assume the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) of such a description for a humanities professor is higher. We'll assign an estimated value (e.g., \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}.
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H).
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3.
   \]

   Finally:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25.
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Answer:

{"probability": "0.25"}
