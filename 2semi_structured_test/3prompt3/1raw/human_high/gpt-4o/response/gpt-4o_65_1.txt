To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason as provided.

First, we will define the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \): Probability that a professor chosen at random is from computer science.
- \( P(A_{H}) \): Probability that a professor chosen at random is from humanities.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

The description suggests characteristics that are more typical of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (low probability since the description is more humanities-oriented)
- \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0.8 \) (high probability since the description matches more closely with humanities)

Lastly, the normalization term \( P(B) \) can be found by using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
