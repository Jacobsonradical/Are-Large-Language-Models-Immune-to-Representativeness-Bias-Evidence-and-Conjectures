{"probability": "0.2"}

The initial (prior) probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors), and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is 0.25 (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors).

The description of Jason suggests characteristics that may be more commonly associated with humanities professors, such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, while also noting that he is not particularly technical, which may be less characteristic of a computer science professor. Given this information, we update our probabilities considering this alignment with traits typically associated with humanities professors.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description would be adjusted downward from the prior probability, and an estimate of 0.2 seems reasonable.
