Given the description of Jason and the information about the study sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's outline the given information:

- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (HU), making a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(HU) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given his discipline. Since we don't have exact likelihoods from the problem, let's make some educated assumptions based on the description provided:

- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

We assign some qualitative likelihoods based on common stereotypes and the description:
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(description | HU) \), is relatively high, say 0.9.
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(description | CS) \), is lower, say 0.2.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

We compute \( P(description) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.15) + (0.225) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.375 \]

Now, we put the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = 0.4 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.4 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.4"}
