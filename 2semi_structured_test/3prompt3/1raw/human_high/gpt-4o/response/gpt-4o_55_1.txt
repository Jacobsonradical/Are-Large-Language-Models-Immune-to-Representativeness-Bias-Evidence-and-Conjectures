This problem can be approached using Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence. Denote \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We are given:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

We need to compute the posterior probability \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \). According to Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) P(H) \]

We need to estimate \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \). Based on the description, Jason does not exhibit traits typically associated with a computer science professor (such as being particularly technical), and his characteristics seem more commonly aligned with a humanities professor.

For the sake of estimation, we can assume subjective probabilities:

- \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \approx 0.1 \) (low, since the traits do not fit computer science well)
- \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \approx 0.6 \) (higher, since the traits fit humanities better)

We now use these values in the formula:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{(0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.6 \cdot 0.25)} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.15} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.333.

So, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.333"}
