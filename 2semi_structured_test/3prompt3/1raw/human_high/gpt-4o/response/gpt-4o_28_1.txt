To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed evidence (Jason's description).

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

1. **Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor**:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor**:
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A_{CS}) \)**:
Given Jason's description is more aligned with characteristics typically expected in the humanities, we can infer that:
\[ P(B|A_{CS}) \text{ (estimate this as lower, e.g.,) } 0.2 \]

4. **Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(B|A_{H}) \)**:
\[ P(B|A_{H}) \text{ (estimate this as higher, e.g.,) } 0.8 \]

5. **Total probability of Jason's description \( P(B) \)**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.43"\}} \]
