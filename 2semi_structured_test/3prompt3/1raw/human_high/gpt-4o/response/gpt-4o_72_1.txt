To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \), the probability of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
   - We also need the likelihood \( P(D|H) \), the probability of observing the description if Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Based on the description, Jason seems to fit the profile of a humanities professor more than a computer science professor due to traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of technical focus. Let's assume for the sake of the exercise:
   
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (he is less likely to be characterized this way but it's possible)
   - \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (he is more likely to be characterized this way)

3. **Marginal Probability** \( P(D) \):
   - This is the total probability of observing the description, irrespective of the profession.
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \)

4. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   - To find the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) \approx 0.429 \)

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429.
