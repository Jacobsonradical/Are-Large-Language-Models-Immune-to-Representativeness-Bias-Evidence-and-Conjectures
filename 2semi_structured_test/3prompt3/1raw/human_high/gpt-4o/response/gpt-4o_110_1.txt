To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor and \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Also, let \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) be the likelihoods of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor respectively.

First, the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} \).

Now, \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

Next, the likelihoods. Based on Jason's description:
- "Creative and imaginative," "often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and "not particularly technical" seem to be characteristics less commonly associated with computer science professors and more with humanities professors.

Thus, let's make assumptions about the likelihoods. While exact values are not given, we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is low, say around 0.2.
- \( P(D|H) \) is high, say around 0.8.

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Where \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:
