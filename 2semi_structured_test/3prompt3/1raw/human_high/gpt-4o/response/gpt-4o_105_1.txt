To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting Jason's description from either pool of professors.

First, we need the base rates (priors):
- Out of the 100 professors, 75 are computer science professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

- The remaining 25 are humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A^C) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).

Next, let's denote the description "Jason's description" as \( D \).

Since Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, these traits are generally more indicative of humanities professors than computer science professors (although there might be exceptions).

Let:
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) = x \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | \text{H}) = y \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Based on the given description and general assumptions about the traits' alignment with discipline stereotypes:
- \( x \) might be relatively low compared to \( y \), perhaps around 0.2 for \( x \) and 0.8 for \( y \).

We calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = 0.4286 \]

Thus, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
