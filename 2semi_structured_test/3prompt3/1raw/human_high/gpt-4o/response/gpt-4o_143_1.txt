To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided.

We aim to find the probability \( P(CS|D) \). According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need the likelihoods, i.e., the probability of the description given the professor is from either field, \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Although we don't know these exact values, we interpret the description to infer Jason's personality is more aligned with typical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors based on the details provided (e.g., emotionally driven, imaginative, non-technical).

Assuming the description fits humanities professors more than computer science professors, we could estimate:
\[
P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \quad (\text{lower probability because description fits less})
\]
\[
P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \quad (\text{higher probability because description fits better})
\]

With these estimates, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now we compute \( P(CS|D) \):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.75)}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.4286"}
\]
