To assess the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the observed personality description.

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \(P(\neg A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to consider \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that we would observe Jason's personality description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) is the probability that we would observe Jason's personality description given that he is a humanities professor.

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might be stereotypically less common in technical fields like computer science compared to humanities. Therefore, we can assume \(P(B|A)\) is low and \(P(B|\neg A)\) is high. Without explicit numerical data from the study, we could make an educated guess for these conditional probabilities.

Let's say:
- \(P(B|A) = 0.2\) (Jason's traits are less typical for a computer science professor)
- \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.8\) (Jason's traits are more typical for a humanities professor)

Finally, we need to compute the marginal probability \(P(B)\), the total probability of observing Jason's description:

\[ 
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) 
= (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) 
= 0.15 + 0.2 
= 0.35 
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
= \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} 
= \frac{0.15}{0.35} 
= \frac{3}{7} 
\approx 0.4286 
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
