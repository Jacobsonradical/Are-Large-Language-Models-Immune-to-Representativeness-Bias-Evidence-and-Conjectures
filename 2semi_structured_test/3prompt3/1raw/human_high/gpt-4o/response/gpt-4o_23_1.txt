To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the given information and apply it carefully.

**Prior probabilities:**
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

**Likelihoods:** Based on the description:
- Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (P(Description | CS))
- Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Description | H))

While we don't have exact numerical values for these likelihoods, we can qualitatively assess the description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and particularly not technical. This description seems to align more closely with common stereotypes of professors in the humanities rather than computer science, suggesting that:

- P(Description | H) > P(Description | CS)

That being said, since exact values are not provided, I will make an informed estimate based on this qualitative assessment. Let's hypothetically assign:

- P(Description | CS) = 0.1 (10% likelihood for a computer science professor matching this description)
- P(Description | H) = 0.9 (90% likelihood for a humanities professor matching this description)

**Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.1 \times 0.75 + 0.9 \times 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.225} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.25 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
