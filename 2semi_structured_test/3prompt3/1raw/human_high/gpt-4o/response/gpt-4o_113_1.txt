To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates and the description provided.

1. **Base Rates**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probabilities are:
     - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
     - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Jason is described as creative, imaginative, not particularly technical, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and exploring. These traits appear to correspond more closely with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

3. **Bayesian Inference**:
   - To apply Bayesian inference, we need the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(D | \text{CS}) \)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D | \text{Humanities}) \)).
   - Without specific likelihood values, we might assume general trends where creativity and less technical proficiency is more likely in humanities.

Given the description, let's assume:
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \) (low, but not impossible)
- \( P(D | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \) (highly likely)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.225} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.25"} \]
