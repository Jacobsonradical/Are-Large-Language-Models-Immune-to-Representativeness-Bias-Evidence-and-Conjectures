To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start by identifying the prior probabilities and then adjusting them based on the description.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(HS)): 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.
   \[
   P(HS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (P(description | CS)): Let's call this number L(CS). Given that the description mentions creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a lack of technical focus, which are less typical for computer science professors, we might estimate this likelihood to be relatively low. Suppose we estimate L(CS) = 0.1.
   - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (P(description | HS)): Let's call this number L(HS). Since humanities professors are often associated with creativity and emotional aspects, we can estimate this likelihood to be higher. Suppose we estimate L(HS) = 0.8.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|HS) \cdot P(HS)
   \]
   
   Using our assumed likelihoods:
   \[
   P(description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
   \]
   
   Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.273.

Therefore, in the required format:
\[
{"probability": "0.273"}
\]
