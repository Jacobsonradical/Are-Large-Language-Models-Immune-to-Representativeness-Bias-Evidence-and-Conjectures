Given the description of Jason, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description being drawn.

Let's detail our knowns:
1. The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities:
\[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \]

3. Without precise probability values for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we'll have to estimate based on the given description. Jason's description aligns more with the characteristics often attributed to humanities professors:
- More imaginative and emotionally driven.
- Not particularly technical.

Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (estimated low probability that a computer science professor fits the description)
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.9 \] (estimated high probability that a humanities professor fits the description)

Now, to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\} \]
