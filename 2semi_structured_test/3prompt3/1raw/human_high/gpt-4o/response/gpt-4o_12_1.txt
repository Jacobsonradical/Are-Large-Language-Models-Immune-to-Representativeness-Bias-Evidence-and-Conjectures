To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (the posterior probability we want to find).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's find the prior \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor \( P(B) \) is:

\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's consider \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor, and \( P(B| \neg A) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.

Based on the given description:
- Jason is creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.

This description seems to align more with typical personality traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, who might be more technical and less emotionally driven.

Let's assign probabilities subjectively based on our understanding:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS professor}) \) = 0.2 (a lower probability, as the description does not closely match the typical profile)
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{humanities professor}) \) = 0.8 (a higher probability, as the description closely matches the typical profile)

Now let's calculate the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor}) + P(\text{description}|\text{humanities professor}) \cdot P(\text{humanities professor}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor})}{P(\text{description})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.43.
