In order to evaluate the probability, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The problem gives us prior probabilities and a description that we can consider as evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(A|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (the description).

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B) \), the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we'll assume that the description \( E \) is more likely to correspond to the personality traits typically associated with humanities professors. This assumption leads us to the following likelihoods:
- \( P(E|A) \), the probability of Jason's description given he's a computer science professor. We'll assume this is relatively low due to the non-technical and emotionally driven nature of the description, say \( P(E|A) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|B) \), the probability of Jason's description given he's a humanities professor. We'll assume this is relatively high due to the alignment of the description with typical humanities traits, say \( P(E|B) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A)P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|A)P(A) + P(E|B)P(B) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, calculating \( P(A|E) \):

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|E) \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
