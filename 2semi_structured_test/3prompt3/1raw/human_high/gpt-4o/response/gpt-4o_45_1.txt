To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here is the notation and calculation step-by-step:

- \(P(CS)\): Prior probability that the professor is from computer science.
- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that the professor is from humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \(P(D)\): Overall probability of the description.

Given the problem description:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H), so:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

Next, we need to estimate \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), the likelihoods of the description given the discipline. Given the description of Jason, his traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical) seem more aligned with typical humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's approximate:
- \(P(D|CS)\) to be relatively low, let's say 0.2.
- \(P(D|H)\) to be higher, say 0.8.

To apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we need the marginal probability \(P(D)\), which can be calculated by:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286, or in answer format:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
