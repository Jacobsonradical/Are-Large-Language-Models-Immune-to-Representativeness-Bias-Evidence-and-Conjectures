To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and the likelihood based on the provided description.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description of Jason fits more with typical traits associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, rather than technical).
   - Let's call the event that the description fits a humanities professor well \(P(D|H)\) and a computer science professor well \(P(D|CS)\).

While the precise numerical likelihoods can be difficult to quantify without more specific data, we can subjectively estimate that the likelihood of this description fitting a humanities professor is higher than it fitting a computer science professor. For sake of calculation, let's assume:

   - \( P(D|H) \) is high, say around 0.9.
   - \( P(D|CS) \), by comparison, is lower, say around 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
Using Bayes' Theorem, we can compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \(D\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

Now we can find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.75)}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.4"}
