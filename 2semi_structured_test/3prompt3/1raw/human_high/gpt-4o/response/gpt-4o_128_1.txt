To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood of the description:**
   We need the probability that a professor with the given description (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical, etc.) is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

   - \( P(description \mid CS) = L(CS) \)
   - \( P(description \mid Hum) = L(Hum) \)

Let's assume based on the description that the traits described (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical) are more commonly associated with humanities professors. For simplicity, we can assume:
   - \( L(CS) = 0.2 \)
   - \( L(Hum) = 0.8 \)

3. **Normalizing constant:**
   This is the total probability of observing the description, considering both types of professors.
   \[
   P(description) = P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Posterior probability:**
   Now, we apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to find \( P(CS \mid description) \):

   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.4286\), which can be rounded to 0.43.

Here is the final answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.43"}
