To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. 

Let's define the terms we need for Bayes' Theorem:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason has the described personality traits.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's define the probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
2. \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a computer science professor has Jason's personality traits.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability that a humanities professor has Jason's personality traits.

From the description provided, it is mentioned that Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical." Given these traits, it is more likely that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor. While numerical values for these are not given, we can qualitatively assess that:

- \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively high.

However, to determine numerical values for these, we could proceed intuitively or with a rough estimate. Let's say:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (low, given the description seems atypical for a CS professor)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \) (high, given the description fits well with humanities)

Lastly, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
