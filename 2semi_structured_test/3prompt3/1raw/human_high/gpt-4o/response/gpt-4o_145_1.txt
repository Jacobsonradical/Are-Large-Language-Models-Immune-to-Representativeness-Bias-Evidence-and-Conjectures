To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant probabilities:

- Prior probability that the professor is from computer science: \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- Prior probability that the professor is from the humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting professors from computer science and the humanities. Given the description suggests creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and less emphasis on technicality, it might be less typical for a computer science professor.

Let's assume:

- Likelihood of such a description for a computer science professor: \(P(D|CS)\).
- Likelihood of such a description for a humanities professor: \(P(D|H)\).

If we assume a rough estimate without specific data:

- \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\) (as creativity and emotional drive might be less common in computer science).
- \(P(D|H) = 0.8\) (as such traits could be more aligned with humanities).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}\]

Where \(P(D)\) (total probability of the description) is:

\[P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]

Substitute the values:

\[P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)\]
\[P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35\]

Now, calculate the posterior:

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
