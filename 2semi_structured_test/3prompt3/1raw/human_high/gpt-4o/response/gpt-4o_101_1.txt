Given the problem, we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Initially, the probability of selecting a computer science professor, based purely on their ratio, is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We are given a description of Jason, which we need to use to update our probabilities. The description suggests that Jason is more creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which aligns more closely with characteristics stereotypically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(Hum | D) = \frac{P(D | Hum) \times P(Hum)}{P(D)} \]

where \( D \) is the description of Jason. While the exact probabilities \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \) are not given, we can reason qualitatively based on the nature of the description. Let's assume:

- Given the description, the probability is higher that Jason fits a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Let's arbitrarily quantify these as \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D | Hum) = 0.8 \) to capture that intuition.
- Using normalizing constant \( P(D) \), which can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

So the required format output is:

```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
