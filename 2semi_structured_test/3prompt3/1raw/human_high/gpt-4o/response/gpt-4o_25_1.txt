Given the description of Jason, we need to use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors.

Let's begin with the base rates (prior probabilities) for the two categories:
- Base rate for computer science professors: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Base rate for humanities professors: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely the description fits each group (the likelihoods). Based on the given information, Jasonâ€™s characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring) appear to align more closely with typical profiles of humanities professors than computer science professors. It is subjective, but we can estimate the likelihoods:

- Likelihood of description given computer science professor (\( P(\text{desc} | \text{CS}) \)): Let's assume this is \( 0.2 \)
- Likelihood of description given humanities professor (\( P(\text{desc} | \text{Humanities}) \)): Let's assume this is \( 0.8 \)

Now, we calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{desc}) = \frac{P(\text{desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{desc})} \]

We need to compute \( P(\text{desc}) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(\text{desc}) = P(\text{desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{desc} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(\text{desc}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(\text{desc}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{desc}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{desc}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{desc}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.43.
