To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate Prior to Any Description)**:
    - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(C) \)): 75 out of 100.
    - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): 25 out of 100.
    - So, \(P(C) = 0.75\) and \(P(H) = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood of Jason's Description Given Each Profession**:
    - Based on the description, Jason does not appear particularly technical but is more imaginative and emotionally driven, which might be more common among humanities professors.

    Though subjective, let's assume the likelihood of this description for humanities professors (\(P(D|H)\)) is high, say 0.8, and less so for computer science professors (\(P(D|C)\)), say 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
    
    \[
    P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
    \]
    
    Plugging in the numbers:

    \[
    P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
    \]

    Solving the equation:

    \[
    P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} â‰ˆ 0.4286
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286. 

So the answer in the required format is:

```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
