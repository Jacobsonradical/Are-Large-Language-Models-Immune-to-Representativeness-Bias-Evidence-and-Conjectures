Certainly! To determine the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which updates our prior belief based on the evidence provided.

First, let's outline the relevant information:

1. Total number of professors = 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities).
2. Description characteristics: creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description provided suggests that Jason has traits that are often more associated with fields like the humanities rather than computer science (e.g., being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

Let's denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the nature of the description, we would generally expect \( P(D|Hum) \) to be higher than \( P(D|CS) \). For the sake of the problem, let's assume some reasonable but not strictly defined estimates:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (since the traits are less common in computer science professors)
- \( P(D|Hum) = 0.8 \) (since the traits are more common in humanities professors)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, can be expanded as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Letâ€™s calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.4286"} \]
