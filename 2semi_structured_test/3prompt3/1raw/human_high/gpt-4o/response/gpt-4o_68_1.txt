To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the personality description.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that any given professor is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of observing the personality description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of observing the personality description.

From the study:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, which gives prior probabilities: \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We also need to evaluate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of seeing someone creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical, etc., among computer science professors.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of seeing those traits among humanities professors.

Given the description of Jason, it seems more stereotypically aligned with a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor, indicating that \( P(B|\neg A) \) may be higher than \( P(B|A) \). However, without concrete numbers for these probabilities, let us assume rough estimates:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (since such traits might be less common among computer science professors)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \) (since such traits might be more common among humanities professors)

Now, let's calculate the total probability, \( P(B) \), using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability, \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
