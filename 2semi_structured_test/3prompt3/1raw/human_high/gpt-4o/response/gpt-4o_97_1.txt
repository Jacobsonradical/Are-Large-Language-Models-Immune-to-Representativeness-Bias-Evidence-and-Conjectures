To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence provided (Jason's description).

We need to identify the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \), the marginal likelihood of Jason’s description.

First, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is simply the proportion of computer science professors in our sample.

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, the prior probability \( P(A^c) \), that Jason is a humanities professor, is:

\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods. This involves some subjectivity in interpreting the description. Based on Jason’s traits, we can make educated guesses about:
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given the description:
- Jason is creative and imaginative but not particularly technical. 
- Jason's traits might be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let’s assign reasonable numbers:
- \( P(B|A) \) might be lower, perhaps 0.2.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) might be higher, perhaps 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
