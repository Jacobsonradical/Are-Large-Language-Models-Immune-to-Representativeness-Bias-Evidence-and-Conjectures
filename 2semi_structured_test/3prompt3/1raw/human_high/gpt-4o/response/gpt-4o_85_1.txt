Firstly, let's establish the prior probabilities for each group. Given that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we examine the given description of Jason. The description suggests that Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, traits that seem more stereotypically aligned with the humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

For the sake of argument, letâ€™s suppose these traits are quite strongly indicative of someone being in the humanities versus computer science. Specifically, let us consider:

\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \]

These are not exact probabilities derived from the study but are reasonable assumptions for the purpose of Bayesian updating given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our beliefs. We want to calculate \( P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where,

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

So,

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Thus,

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately \( 0.4286 \).

Thus, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
