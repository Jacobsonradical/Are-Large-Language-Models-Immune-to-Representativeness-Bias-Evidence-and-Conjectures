To solve this, we start by considering the base rates of the two groups in the sample and then evaluate the description's likelihood under each group.

1. **Base Rates:**
   - Probability that a description belongs to a computer science (CS) professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a description belongs to a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The description portrays Jason as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical. This description might suggest a higher likelihood of fitting a humanities professor rather than a CS professor. 

However, to fully address this, weâ€™d generally require a numerical likelihood assessment for how well the description matches professors from each discipline. Although we might intuitively expect a higher match for humanities than computer science based on qualitative interpretation, let's denote:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = L_\text{CS} \)
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = L_\text{Humanities} \)

For simplicity, let's assume that Jason's typical traits fit a humanities professor three times as well as they do a computer science professor. Thus:
   - \( L_\text{CS} = 1 \)
   - \( L_\text{Humanities} = 3 \)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**

Using Bayes' Theorem to find the updated probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description:
\[ 
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} 
\]

where \( P(\text{description}) \) takes into account the description probability over both groups:
\[ 
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) 
\]

Thus:
\[ 
P(\text{description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.75 = 1.5 
\]

Finally:
\[ 
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1.5} = \frac{0.75}{1.5} = 0.5 
\]

Given the assumptions and qualitative interpretation made:

{"probability": "0.5"}
