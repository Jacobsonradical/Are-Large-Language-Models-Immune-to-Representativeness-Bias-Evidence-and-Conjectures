To determine the posterior that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- \( n_{\text{CS}} = 75 \) (number of computer science professors)
- \( n_{\text{Humanities}} = 25 \) (number of humanities professors)
- Total number of professors \( n_{\text{Total}} = 100 \)

Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the given description for each type of professor. However, since the description suggests traits that are more aligned with humanities (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring) and less with computer science (e.g., "not particularly technical"), we can reasonably assume that the probability of the description given the professor is from humanities is higher than the probability of the description given the professor is from computer science.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) as the probability of the description if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) as the probability of the description if the professor is from humanities.

We will assume (based on the description's characteristics) the following likelihoods for simplicity:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we update our belief:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

So:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \left\{ "probability": "0.43" \right\} \]
