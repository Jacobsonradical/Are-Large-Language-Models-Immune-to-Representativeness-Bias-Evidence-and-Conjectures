To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the information given by the description.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 
   \]
   Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   We need to assess how likely this description would be for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the description:
   - Jason is creative, imaginative, often emotionally driven, and enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
   - He is not particularly technical.

Given these traits:
   - The description aligns more strongly with typical traits associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors as mentioned (creativity, emotional drive, non-technical nature, interest in reading and exploring).

Letâ€™s denote the likelihood of this description given that the professor is from computer science as \( P(D \mid CS) \) and given that the professor is from humanities as \( P(D \mid H) \).
   - We will assume \( P(D \mid CS) \) is relatively low because the traits described are less aligned with a typical computer science professor.
   - In contrast, \( P(D \mid H) \) is relatively high as these traits align more with humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's quantify these likelinesses:
   \[
   P(D \mid CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{(a low probability because of mismatch in traits)}
   \]
   \[
   P(D \mid H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(a high probability because of good match in traits)}
   \]

3. **Bayesian Updating:**
   Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \):
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where 
   \[
   P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   So,
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) 
         = 0.15 + 0.2
         = 0.35
   \]

   Now, calculating \( P(CS \mid D) \):
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} 
                 = \frac{0.15}{0.35} 
                 = \frac{15}{35} 
                 = \frac{3}{7} 
                 \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\{"probability": "0.4286"\}
