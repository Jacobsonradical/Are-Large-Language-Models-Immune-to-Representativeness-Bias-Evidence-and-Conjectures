To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being Jason’s if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

From the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) describe how likely Jason’s description is given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given the provided description, Jason appears more aligned with typical characteristics common in the humanities (creative, imaginative, etc.). Let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \) (10% chance that a computer science professor fits this description).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.7 \) (70% chance that a humanities professor fits this description).

Now, using the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|\neg A) * P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 * 0.75) + (0.7 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 * 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is 0.3 or 30%.

Here is the requested format:
