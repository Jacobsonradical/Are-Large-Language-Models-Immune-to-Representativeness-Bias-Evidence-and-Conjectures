First, let's establish the base rates given in the problem:
- 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, let's analyze the description to look at how likely it is that a professor with the given traits belongs to either group. 

Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, and being gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more closely with common stereotypes of professors in the humanities rather than computer science, since humanities often emphasize creativity and emotional engagement, whereas computer science might be seen as more technical.

To use Bayes' Theorem to update the probabilities in light of this information, we need to estimate the likelihoods of Jason's traits given that he is from computer science or humanities. Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = p_1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = p_2 \)

Assume:
- \( p_1 \) is significantly lower than \( p_2 \), since Jason's traits are less typical for computer science professors.
- For illustration, let's assign \( p_1 = 0.1 \) and \( p_2 = 0.9 \).

Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

We can compute \( P(\text{Description}) \) as:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
\]
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Now calculate the posterior probability:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{(0.1 \times 0.75)}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
