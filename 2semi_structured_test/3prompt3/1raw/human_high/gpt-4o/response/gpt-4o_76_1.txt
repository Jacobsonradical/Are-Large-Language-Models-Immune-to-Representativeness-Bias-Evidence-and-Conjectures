To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( A \), and the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( B \). We seek \( P(A|D) \), where \( D \) is the description given.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) P(B)}{P(D)} \]

We need the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), and the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \). First, we know that:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description fits humanities professors better, we estimate:
\[ P(D|A) \approx 0.1 \] (assuming Jason’s description is less likely for a computer science professor)
\[ P(D|B) \approx 0.7 \] (assuming Jason’s description is more likely for a humanities professor)

Using the law of total probability, we find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) P(A) + P(D|B) P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1)(0.75) + (0.7)(0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Substituting back:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{(0.1)(0.75)}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
