To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, compute the prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The complement, \( P(A^c) \):
\[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assign subjective probabilities for Jason's description being typical in each field (computer science and humanities). Given that Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," it seems more typical for a humanities professor than for a computer science professor. Hence, we can estimate:

- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability of description given he is a computer science professor (subjectively lower, e.g., 0.2)
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = Probability of description given he is a humanities professor (subjectively higher, e.g., 0.8)

Now calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429.
