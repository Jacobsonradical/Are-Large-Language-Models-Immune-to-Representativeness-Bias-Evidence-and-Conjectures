To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates the prior probability and the likelihood of the description fitting each group.

First, assign the prior probabilities based on the given sample sizes:
- Probability \((P(CS))\) Jason is a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability \((P(Hum))\) Jason is a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we must consider how likely the description fits each group. The description suggests traits more commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate) rather than with computer science professors (which we might expect to be more technically oriented).

Let's denote:
- \( P(Desc|CS) \) as the probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(Desc|Hum) \) as the probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Given the description seems more suited to humanities, we can estimate:
- \( P(Desc|CS) \) to be relatively low, say around 0.2.
- \( P(Desc|Hum) \) to be relatively high, say around 0.8.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS|Desc) \)):

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

By substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.43"}
