To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( Hum \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) can be determined by the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description is picked at random, and it aligns more closely with traits typically associated with humanities (i.e., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we might estimate:
- \( P(D|CS) \) could be relatively low.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) could be relatively high.

However, without exact probabilities, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.9 \)

Now we need to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
