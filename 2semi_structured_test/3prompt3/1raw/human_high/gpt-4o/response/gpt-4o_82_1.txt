To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \):
     \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:** These are the probabilities of observing the description of Jason given that he is from either computer science or humanities.
   - Since Jason has traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading) that are more stereotypically aligned with the humanities than with computer science professors, we'll denote these likelihoods as:
     - \( P(D | CS) = \text{low} \)
     - \( P(D | H) = \text{high} \)

   While we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we make a reasonable assumption based on the description. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   
   Where:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values we get:
   \[
   P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25
   \]

   \[
   P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
   \]

   Now, calculate the posterior:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
   \]

\[
\boxed{\text{{probability}}: {"0.25"}}
\]
