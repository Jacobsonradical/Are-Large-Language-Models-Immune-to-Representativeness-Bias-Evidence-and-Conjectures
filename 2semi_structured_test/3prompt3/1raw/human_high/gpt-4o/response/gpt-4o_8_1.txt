To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probabilities we need to consider are:

- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\))
  \[P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(HS)\))
  \[P(HS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

We also need to consider the likelihood of the description given the two categories (computer science and humanities). Given the description provided, Jason seems to have traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, not being particularly technical which may be more indicative of a humanities professor. 

Let's denote:
- \(D\): Jason's description

Now, we need an estimate for:
- \(P(D | CS)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \(P(D | HS)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor

Assume that since Jason is described as not particularly technical, the probability \(P(D | HS)\) is higher than \(P(D | CS)\). For simplicity, let's assume:
- \(P(D | CS) = 0.2\)
- \(P(D | HS) = 0.8\)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \(P(CS | D)\):
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \(P(D)\) (total probability of the description) is given by:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HS) \cdot P(HS)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35
\]

So,
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the final answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
