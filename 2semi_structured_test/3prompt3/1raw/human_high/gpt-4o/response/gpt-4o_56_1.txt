To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's find the prior probability \( P(CS) \):

\[
P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is:

\[
P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both CS and humanities and can be expressed as:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Next, based on the description given, it seems more likely that Jason is a humanities professor because the traits described (imaginative, creative, emotionally driven, non-technical) align more closely with common stereotypes of humanities professors than computer science professors (who might typically be seen as more technical and analytical). Let's assume:

\[
P(D|CS) = 0.2
\]

and

\[
P(D|H) = 0.8
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.4286, which rounds to 0.43.

\[
{"probability": "0.43"}
\]
