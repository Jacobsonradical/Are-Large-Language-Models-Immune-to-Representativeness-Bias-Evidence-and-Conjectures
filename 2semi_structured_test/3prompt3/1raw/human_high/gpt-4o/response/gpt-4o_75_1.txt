To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We need to break down each component:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor: there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven (traits often more associated with humanities than technical fields), let's assume this probability is lower. For the sake of the example, let's assign a subjective likelihood of, say, 0.1 (10%).

- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. Since the described traits align more closely with humanities, letâ€™s assume a higher probability, say, 0.6 (60%).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.6 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.33 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.33"}
