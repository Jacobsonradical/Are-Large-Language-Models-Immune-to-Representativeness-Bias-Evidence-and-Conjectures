To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, we should outline the relevant probabilities:
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) or humanities (P(H)).
- The likelihood of the description being given for a computer science professor (P(D|CS)) and for a humanities professor (P(D|H)).

Our prior probabilities, based on the numbers given, are:
- P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

To assign likelihoods, we have to make assumptions based on the given description of Jason. He is described as "not particularly technical," which might be less common in computer science and more common in the humanities. However, these assumptions are subjective. For the purposes of this exercise, let's hypothesize the likelihoods as follows:
- P(D|CS) = 0.2 (since "not particularly technical" is less likely but still possible in CS with traits like creativity and imagination)
- P(D|H) = 0.8 (since these traits might be more common among humanities professors)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(CS|D) = (P(D|CS) * P(CS)) / (P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H))

Substituting the assumed values:

P(CS|D) = (0.2 * 0.75) / (0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25)
         = (0.15) / (0.15 + 0.2)
         = 0.15 / 0.35
         â‰ˆ 0.4286

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
