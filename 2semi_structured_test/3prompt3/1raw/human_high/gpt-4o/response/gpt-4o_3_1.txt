Let's start by using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's set the priors and the likelihoods based on the description and the provided sample sizes:

1. **Prior Probability:**

- Probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(75/100 = 0.75\)
- Probability that Jason is a Humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(25/100 = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood:**

For illustrative purposes, suppose the likelihoods of the description fitting a professor from each group are subjective and set to reflect common beliefs about the fit given the description. We assume:

- \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\) (The description seems less common for a typical computer science professor)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.8\) (The description seems more common for a humanities professor)

3. **Compute the Posterior:**

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

\[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(CS) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.25 \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{(0.15) + (0.20)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286, rounded to four decimal places.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
