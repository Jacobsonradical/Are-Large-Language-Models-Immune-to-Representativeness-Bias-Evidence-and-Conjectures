Let's break down the information:

1. **Base Rates:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, prior probability that a randomly chosen description is for a computer science professor \((P(CS))\) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen description is for a humanities professor \((P(Hum))\) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood Based on Description:**
   - The description given for Jason suggests traits that are more commonly associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical).

Given Jason's description appears to align more closely with the typical traits attributed to humanities professors, it suggests he is more likely to be one.

To quantify this, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

While we don't have exact probabilities for \(P(Description|CS)\) and \(P(Description|Hum)\), we can make the following qualitative assessment:
- \(P(Description|CS)\) is likely low because Jason has traits that are atypical for computer science professors.
- \(P(Description|Hum)\) is higher because Jason's traits are more aligned with humanities professors.

Given the qualitative nature of the problem, let's assume:
- \( P(Description|CS) \) = 0.2
- \( P(Description|Hum) \) = 0.8

Then the probability of the description for Jason being observed:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

\[P(Description) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35\]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{(0.2 \times 0.75)}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
