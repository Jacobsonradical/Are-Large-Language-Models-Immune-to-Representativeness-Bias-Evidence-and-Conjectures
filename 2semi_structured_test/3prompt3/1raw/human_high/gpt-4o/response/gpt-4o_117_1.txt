To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that hypothesis A (Jason is a computer science professor) is true given evidence B (Jason's description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of evidence B given hypothesis A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of evidence B.

In this context:
- A = Jason is a computer science professor
- B = Jason's description

Let's break down each component:

1. \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Out of 100 professors, 75 are in computer science, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. This is not explicitly given, but we can assume it’s relatively low because the description emphasizes creativity, emotional-driven nature, and lack of technicality, which are typically less associated with the stereotype of computer science professors. Let's assume it’s a small probability, say 0.2.

4. \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. This is assumed to be higher due to the stereotype alignment. Let’s assume it’s relatively high, say 0.8.

5. \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description, which we can get using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Using the required format:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
