To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description in the entire sample.

First, let's define the events:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor
- B: Jason's description as given

We start with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors total, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Since the description of Jason suggests he is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, not particularly technical, these traits might be more aligned with typical humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \): There might be some computer science professors like Jason, but they are relatively fewer.
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \): Humanities professors with Jason's description are more common.

Now, we use these probabilities to compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

\[ {"probability": "0.4286"} \]
