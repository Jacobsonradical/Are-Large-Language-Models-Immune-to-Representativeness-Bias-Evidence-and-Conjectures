To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we set our priors:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Let's consider the likelihoods. Based on the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate but not particularly technical, it seems more stereotypically aligned with humanities characteristics than computer science characteristics.

Given that the description aligns more closely with humanities traits, we can set the likelihoods hypothetically (as actual empirical data is not provided):
- \( P(D|CS) \) could be low, let's say \( 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) \) could be higher, let's say \( 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus,
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.4286"}} \]
