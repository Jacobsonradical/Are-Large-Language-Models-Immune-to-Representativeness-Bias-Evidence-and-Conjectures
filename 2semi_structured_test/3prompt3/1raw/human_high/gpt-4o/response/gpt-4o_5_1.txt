To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - Probability that the description is of a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - Probability that the description is of a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
    - \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, these traits might be more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's assume the likelihoods based on typical personality trait distributions (Note: These should ideally be based on empirical data, but we'll approximate here):

    - Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (less likely among CS professors)
    - \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (more likely among humanities professors)

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)

First, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Then, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.4286 \).
