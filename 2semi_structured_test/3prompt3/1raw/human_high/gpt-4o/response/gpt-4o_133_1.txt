To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's establish the prior probabilities and other relevant information:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The initial (prior) probability of a professor being from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The initial (prior) probability of a professor being from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we'll need to consider how likely the given description (let's denote it as \(D\)) is to be describing a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Let's assume the description of Jason is more consistent with the traits commonly found in humanities professors rather than computer science professors. For the sake of calculation, let's assume the following:

- The likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason’s description (\(P(D|CS)\)) is low, say 0.2.
- The likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason’s description (\(P(D|Hum)\)) is high, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS|D)\)):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we calculate \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description \(D\):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \times P(Hum)
\]

Plugging in the numbers we assumed:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, we use this to find the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286. Therefore, in the format requested:

\{ "probability": "0.4286" \}
