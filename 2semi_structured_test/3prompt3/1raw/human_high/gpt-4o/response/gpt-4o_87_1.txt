Given the description provided for Jason, we need to update our prior beliefs about which group (computer science or humanities) he belongs to. Here's a step-by-step Bayesian reasoning approach to calculate the posterior probability:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Priors for computer science professors (\( P(CS) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Priors for humanities professors (\( P(H) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Likelihood that a computer science professor matches the description (\( P(D|CS) \)): This requires assessing how characteristic the description of Jason is for a computer science professor. Given terms like "not particularly technical," the likelihood might be low, say \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \).
   - Likelihood that a humanities professor matches the description (\( P(D|H) \)): The description fits the stereotypical view of someone in the humanities better due to attributes like "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical". Let's say \( P(D|H) = 0.6 \).

3. **Normalizing Constant**:
   - \( P(D) \) = \( P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) \) = \( 0.1 \times 0.75 + 0.6 \times 0.25 \)
   - \( P(D) \) = \( 0.075 + 0.15 \)
   - \( P(D) \) = \( 0.225 \)

4. **Posterior Calculation**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem, \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.225} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = 0.333 \)

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.333"}
