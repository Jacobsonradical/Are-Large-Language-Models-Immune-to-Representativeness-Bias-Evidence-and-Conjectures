First, we start by noting the base rates provided by the study: out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. This gives us an initial (prior) probability of being a computer science professor of 0.75.

\[
P(CS) = 0.75
\]
\[
P(Hum) = 0.25
\]

Next, let's consider the provided description of Jason. The description emphasizes traits such as creativity, imagination, emotional drive, enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring, which are intuitively more common attributes among humanities professors than among computer science professors. The description also mentions that Jason is "not particularly technical," which further suggests he might fit better in the humanities rather than a heavily technical field like computer science.

To incorporate this descriptive evidence alongside the base rates, we apply Bayes' theorem. Although we don't have exact likelihoods, we can infer relative likeliness. Let's assume:

\[
P(description | CS) << 1
\]
\[
P(description | Hum) >> P(description | CS)
\]

This is because the description matches typical profiles more aligned with humanities.

Therefore, if the likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(description | Hum)}{P(description | CS)} \) is very high, our posterior probability \( P(CS | description) \) will be much lower than the prior \( P(CS) \).

Assuming the relative weight of this description is considerable, let's say it's 10 times more likely given a humanities professor than a computer science professor:

\[
\frac{P(description | Hum)}{P(description | CS)} \approx 10
\]

Using an informal approximation of Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(Hum | description) \approx \frac{P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) + P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}
\]

Substituting \( X \) for \( P(description | CS) \):

\[
P(Hum | description) \approx \frac{10X \cdot 0.25}{10X \cdot 0.25 + X \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(Hum | description) \approx \frac{2.5X}{2.5X + 0.75X} \approx \frac{2.5}{2.5 + 0.75} \approx \frac{2.5}{3.25} \approx 0.77
\]

Then,

\[
P(CS | description) = 1 - P(Hum | description) \approx 1 - 0.77 \approx 0.23
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.23.
