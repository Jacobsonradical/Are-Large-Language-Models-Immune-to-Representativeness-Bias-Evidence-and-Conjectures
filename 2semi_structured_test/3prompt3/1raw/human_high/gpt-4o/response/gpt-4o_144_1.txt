To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start with the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description fitting the profile of either the computer science professors or the humanities professors.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

Next, we consider the likelihood of the description given each category. The description of Jason suggests he is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys reading, and not particularly technical. These characteristics seem more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors.

Given that, we could reasonably assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) = 0.1 \) (likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor)
- \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.9 \) (likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.225} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
