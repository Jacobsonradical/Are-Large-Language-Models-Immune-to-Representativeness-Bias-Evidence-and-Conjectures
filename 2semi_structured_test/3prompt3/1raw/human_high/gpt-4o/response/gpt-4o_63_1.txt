To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description fits computer science and humanities professors.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**: 
   \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(B|A))**:
   We need to subjectively estimate how well Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given the description of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical:
   - It seems more aligned with a humanities profile than a typical computer science profile.

Let's assign rough likelihoods for the sake of calculation:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Overall Probability (P(B))**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayesâ€™ Theorem**:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.428 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.428.
