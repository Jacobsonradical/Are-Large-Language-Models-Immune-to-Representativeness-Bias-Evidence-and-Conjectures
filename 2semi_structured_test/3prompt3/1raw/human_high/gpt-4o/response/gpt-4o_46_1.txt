To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The steps involve calculating the prior probabilities, the likelihood of the description given the professions, and then combining these to get the posterior probability.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood (or the probability) of having the given description if Jason is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)).
   - The likelihood (or the probability) of having the given description if Jason is a humanities professor (P(D|H)).

Given Jason's description, he seems to fit the stereotype of a humanities professor more than a computer science professor based on characteristics such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Let's assume some approximate likelihoods:
   - P(D|CS) = 0.2 (since the description matches less with the typical computer science professor)
   - P(D|H) = 0.8 (since the description matches more with the typical humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)}
     \]

   Substituting the values:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25}
     \]

     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
     \]

     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
     \]

     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
     \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   \text{{"probability": "0.4286"}}
   \]

So the final answer in the desired format is: 
\{
"probability": "0.4286"
\}
