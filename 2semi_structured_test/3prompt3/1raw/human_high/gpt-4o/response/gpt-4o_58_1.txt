To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should utilize Bayes' Theorem. 

We know the following:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- A description of one professor is chosen at random.

Bayes' Theorem can be represented as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the description \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the given description:

- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with those in the humanities than in computer science.

Assuming that \( P(D|CS) \) (the probability of the description given a computer science professor) is relatively low, say \( 0.2 \), and \( P(D|H) \) (the probability of the description given a humanities professor) is relatively high, say \( 0.8 \):

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.
