To solve this problem, we will apply Bayes' Theorem to update the probability based on the given description.

First, let's denote the following:
- \( H_{CS} \) : Hypothesis that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H_{Hum} \) : Hypothesis that Jason is one of the humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are given by the proportion of each group in the sample:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods of the given description under each hypothesis. However, without specific data on the probability distribution of personality traits, we have to rely on intuition based on typical characteristics.

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys travel and reading, and not particularly technical. These traits may be more aligned with stereotypical humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let's approximate:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \) (low likelihood for computer science given the non-technical and emotionally driven description)
- \( P(E|H_{Hum}) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood for humanities given the creative and imaginative traits)

We can now apply Bayes' Theorem to update the probabilities.

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly for humanities:

\[ P(H_{Hum}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum})}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is just a normalization factor, and considering the relative likelihoods:

\[ \frac{P(H_{CS}|E)}{P(H_{Hum}|E)} = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E|H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum})} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \frac{P(H_{CS}|E)}{P(H_{Hum}|E)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} = 0.75 \]

Let:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.75x \]
\[ P(H_{Hum}|E) = x \]

Given that \( P(H_{CS}|E) + P(H_{Hum}|E) = 1 \):

\[ 0.75x + x = 1 \]
\[ 1.75x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{1.75} \]
\[ x \approx 0.571 \]

So:

\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = 0.75 \times 0.571 \approx 0.428 \]
\[ P(H_{Hum}|E) = 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.428.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.428"}
