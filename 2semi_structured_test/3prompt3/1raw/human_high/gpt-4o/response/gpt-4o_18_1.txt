To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to make use of Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines our prior knowledge (base rates) with new evidence to give us the posterior probability.

Here, our prior information:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

This results in a base rate probability:
- P(CS) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25 / (75 + 25) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Now, the given description of Jason appears to be more likely for a humanities professor than a computer science professor given that he is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, and not particularly technical.

Let's denote:
- E as the evidence (the description of Jason)
- P(E|CS) as the probability of the evidence given CS professor
- P(E|H) as the probability of the evidence given Humanities professor

Since the description fits more closely with a humanities professor, let's assume:
- P(E|CS) ≈ 0.2 (He could still be a CS professor but it seems less likely)
- P(E|H) ≈ 0.8 (This seems more fitting for a humanities professor)

We can now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|E) ≈ 0.4286 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer should be formatted as:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
