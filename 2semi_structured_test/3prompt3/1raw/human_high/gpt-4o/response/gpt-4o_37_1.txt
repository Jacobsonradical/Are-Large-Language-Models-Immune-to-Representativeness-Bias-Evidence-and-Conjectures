To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem incorporates prior probabilities (base rates) and the likelihood of the observed evidence under each hypothesis.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are based on the proportions of professors in each field:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor \( = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor \( = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we consider the likelihood of the evidence (Jason's description) for each field:

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical), it seems he fits more closely with typical traits associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. We need to assign plausible likelihoods for these traits:

- \( P(\text{Description} \mid A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid B) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

For the sake of simplicity, consider:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid A) \) to be low, say 0.2 (indicating that computer science professors are less likely to match this description).
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid B) \) to be high, say 0.8 (indicating that humanities professors are more likely to match this description).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(B \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is a normalizing constant, we can simplify to:
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{Description} \mid B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.20} \]
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) â‰ˆ 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately \(0.43\).
