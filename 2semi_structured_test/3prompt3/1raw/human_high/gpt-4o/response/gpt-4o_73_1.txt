To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (as opposed to a humanities professor), we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

Step 1: Determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which can be calculated from the sample sizes: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Step 2: Estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, these traits might be less common in computer science, where technical skills play a significant role. We might subjectively estimate this probability as lower. Let’s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. These traits are stereotypically more aligned with the humanities. Let’s assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \).

Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability.
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Step 4: Apply Bayes' Theorem.
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is \( P(A|B) = 0.3 \), or 30%.
