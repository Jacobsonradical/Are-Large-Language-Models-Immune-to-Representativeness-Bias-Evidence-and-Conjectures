To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his described characteristics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
    - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)): This requires judgment based on the description. Given the description emphasizing creativity, emotional drive, and lack of technical focus, it's reasonable to assume this is less likely for a computer science professor and more likely for a humanities professor.
    - Let's assign \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\) (a lower probability considering the mismatch with typical traits of technical fields).
    - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)): Given the alignment with traits typically found in humanities, let's assign \(P(D|H) = 0.9\).

3. **Normalizing constant (total probability of the description)**:
    - \(P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25)\)
    - \(P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3\)

4. **Bayes' theorem**:
    - The posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) is given by:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]
    - Substituting the values:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
