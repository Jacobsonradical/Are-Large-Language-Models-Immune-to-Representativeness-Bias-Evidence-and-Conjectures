To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors given his description, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the base rates (priors) and the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor vs. a humanities professor.

First, the priors:
- The prior probability of being a CS professor (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)) is 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given being a CS professor (P(Description|CS)) versus a humanities professor (P(Description|H)). Based on Jason's description, it seems more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, not technical).

Let's assume the following likelihoods:
- P(Description|CS) is low, say 0.2
- P(Description|H) is high, say 0.8

Now using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.4286.
