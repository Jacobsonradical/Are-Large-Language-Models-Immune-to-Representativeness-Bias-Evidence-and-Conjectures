To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider both the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches our expectations for computer science professors vs. humanities professors.

First, letâ€™s look at the base rates. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Thus, the base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

and the base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a humanities professor is:

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess how likely this description fits each group. The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, non-technical focus, and interests aligned more closely with humanities. This makes the description seem more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, we'll need to formalize this intuition.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the event of the given description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description fits humanities better, we can reasonably assume that:

\[ P(D|CS) < P(D|Hum) \]

For simplicity, to make a concrete estimation:
- Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (meaning this description is not very typical for a computer science professor).
- And \( P(D|Hum) = 0.9 \) (meaning this description is fairly typical for a humanities professor).

We now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

Now, the posterior probability is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
