To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities (\( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \)):**
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (Probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

2. **Probability of the description given computer science or humanities (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)):**
   - Based on the description of Jason as an "imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical person," it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.
   - Let’s assume that the probability of this description fitting a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)) is 0.2.
   - Let’s assume that the probability of this description fitting a humanities professor (\( P(B|\neg A) \)) is 0.8.

3. **Total probability of the description (\( P(B) \)):**
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \)

4. **Application of Bayes' theorem:**
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{(0.2 \times 0.75)}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.
