To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a professor from each group. Based on the description provided (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical), it may seem to more closely align with the typical traits we might stereotypically associate with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) as the probability of the description given it’s a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) as the probability of the description given it’s a humanities professor.

Without specific numbers, we can heuristically assert that the description is more likely for a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Suppose we believe that the description fits a humanities professor twice as likely as it fits a computer science professor:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 0.6 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.6 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.6.
