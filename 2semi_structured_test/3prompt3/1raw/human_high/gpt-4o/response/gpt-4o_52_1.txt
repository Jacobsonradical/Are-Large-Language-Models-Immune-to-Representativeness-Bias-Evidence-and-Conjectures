First, let's consider the base rates (prior probabilities) for Jason being a professor in each group:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) of a random professor being a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75.
- The prior probability \( P(\text{H}) \) of a random professor being a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25.

Next, let's consider which group Jason's description aligns with more closely.

Jason is described as:
- Creative and imaginative
- Often emotionally driven
- Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
- Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.

These traits seem more aligned with the humanities than with computer science. Therefore, let us assign probabilities to the likelihood of a computer science professor or a humanities professor having these traits. 

You can make some reasonable assumptions:
- Letâ€™s assume the likelihood of a humanities professor having these traits is fairly high, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \) = 0.9.
- Whereas, the likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits may be lower, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \times P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.375 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.4 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.4"}} \]
