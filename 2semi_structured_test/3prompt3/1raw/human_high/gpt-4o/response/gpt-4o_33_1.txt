To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, let's outline the initial probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \) (the probability of this description given that the professor is in computer science)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) (the probability of this description given that the professor is in the humanities)

Given the description of Jason:
- Creative and imaginative.
- Emotionally driven.
- Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
- Gifted, passionate, not particularly technical.

This description seems to align more with typical traits expected from someone in the humanities rather than in computer science, where one might expect more technical focus. Therefore, we might consider the likelihoods as follows:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \) might be lower, say 0.3.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) might be higher, say 0.7.

3. **Normalizing Constant**:
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.175 = 0.4 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = 0.5625 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5625. 

In the required format:

{"probability": "0.5625"}
