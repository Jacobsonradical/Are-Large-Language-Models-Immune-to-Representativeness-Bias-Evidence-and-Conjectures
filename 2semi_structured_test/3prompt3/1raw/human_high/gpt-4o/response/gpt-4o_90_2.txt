Given the details provided, we need to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. We start by using Bayes' theorem. The probability of Jason being a computer science professor given his description can be calculated as follows:

1. **Prior probabilities**: 

   - Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100, so \( P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).
   - Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100, so \( P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:

   Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jasonâ€™s description given that he is a computer science professor and \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of his description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given that Jason's description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, interest in traveling, reading, and non-technical nature, these traits might be less common, on average, among computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, without exact likelihood values, we can make a reasoned estimate:

   - Assume \( P(D|CS) \) is low, given the typical stereotype of computer science professors: let's approximate it at, say, 0.2.
   - Assume \( P(D|H) \) is higher, given the trait description: let's approximate it at 0.8.

3. **Posterior probability** using Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.20} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.429
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is approximately 0.43.
