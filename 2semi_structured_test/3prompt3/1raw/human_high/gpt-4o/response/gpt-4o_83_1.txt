To assess the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- C: Jason is a computer science professor
- H: Jason is a humanities professor

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

First, let's use the given probabilities:
- Base rate for computer science professors: \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Base rate for humanities professors: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the description \( D \) given each profession. Since Jason's description highlights traits like creativity and being emotionally driven (traits more commonly associated with the humanities), we might reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|C) \) (likelihood of description given Jason is a computer science professor) is relatively low.
- \( P(D|H) \) (likelihood of description given Jason is a humanities professor) is relatively high.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286. Given the required format:
