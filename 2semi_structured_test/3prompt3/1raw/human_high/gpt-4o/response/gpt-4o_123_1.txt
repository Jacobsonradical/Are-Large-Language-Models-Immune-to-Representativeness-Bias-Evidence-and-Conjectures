To determine the probability (posterior) that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the necessary information and steps:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): 75 out of 100 \(\implies 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(Hum) \)): 25 out of 100 \(\implies 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(D | Hum) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given the description of Jason – creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and not particularly technical – these traits seem to align more with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume:

   - \( P(D | CS) \) is likely to be lower.
   - \( P(D | Hum) \) is likely to be higher.

For simplicity, let's assign:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (hypothetical value indicating these traits are less common among computer science professors),
   - \( P(D | Hum) = 0.8 \) (hypothetical value indicating these traits are more common among humanities professors).

3. **Total probability of the description \( P(D) \):**
   We can find \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ = 0.35 \]

4. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Plugging the values in:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided is approximately 0.4286.
