To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (in this case, that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the evidence (the overall probability of the description irrespective of academic field).
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description).

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(\text{not } A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   This is more subjective, but based on the description provided, attributes like "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical" may be more associated with the humanities than computer science. However, we'll have to work with what is available.

3. **Total Probability of the Evidence, \( P(B) \)**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Let's assume approximate likelihoods:
- Likelihood \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (as Jason's description seems less typical of a computer science professor).
- Likelihood \( P(B|\text{not } A) \approx 0.8 \) (as Jason's description seems more typical of a humanities professor).

Now, calculate the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.43"}
