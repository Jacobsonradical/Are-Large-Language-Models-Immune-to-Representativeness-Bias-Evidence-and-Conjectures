{"probability": "0.2"}

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Base Rates**: Initially, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), and the probability that he is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**: We need to consider the likelihood of the description given Jason's group (computer science or humanities). 

    - Jason is described as creative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is not particularly technical.
    - These characteristics might be more strongly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, given common stereotypes and descriptions.

    Let's denote:
    - \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is in computer science.
    - \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is in humanities.

    If we assume:
    - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \), since the description is less typical of computer science professors.
    - \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.7 \), since it’s more typical of humanities professors.

3. **Calculating Posterior using Bayes’ Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   
   We need \( P(D) \) (the overall probability of the description). Using the law of total probability,
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25
   \]
   Now, using Bayes' Theorem,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3
   \]
   
After considering the possible numbers for likelihoods and stereotypes, I adjust to:
\[
P(CS|D) = 0.2
\]

Therefore,
\[
\text{"probability": "0.2"}
\]
