To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to define the prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the study:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given Jason's description, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of observing someone with Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of observing someone with Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical. These traits might be more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Assuming the description is more likely for humanities professors than for computer science professors, we can qualitatively say:
- \( P(D|C) \) is likely lower than \( P(D|H) \).

For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (since not particularly technical traits are less common among CS professors).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (since these traits are more common among humanities professors).

Now apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D|C) P(C) + P(D|H) P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.2 \times 0.75 + 0.8 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.4286 \).
