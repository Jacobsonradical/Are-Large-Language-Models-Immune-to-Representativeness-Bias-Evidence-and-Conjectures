To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \(C\) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \(H\) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

We are given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\), the prior probability that a randomly picked professor is from computer science.
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), the prior probability that a randomly picked professor is from the humanities.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(D\) is the description given for Jason.

However, to find \(P(C|D)\) and thus the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science, we need the likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\):

- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description being from a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\) is the likelihood of the description being from a humanities professor.

Given the description, Jason's characteristics (creative, imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) align more with the humanities based on common stereotypes and known personality traits associated with these fields.

Assuming:
- \(P(D|C)\) is relatively low, say around 0.1, because the description does not fit the stereotypical technical traits often associated with computer science professors.
- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively high, say around 0.9, because the description fits well with traits often associated with humanities professors.

We calculate the normalization factor \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

Then,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
