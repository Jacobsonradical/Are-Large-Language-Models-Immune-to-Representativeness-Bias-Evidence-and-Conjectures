To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we will use Bayes' theorem. The prior probabilities are based on the distribution of the sample (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors).

**Step 1: Define the prior probabilities:**

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

**Step 2: Define the likelihoods:**

Based on the description, Jason appears more aligned with traits common to humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Letâ€™s assume these likelihoods based on stereotypical characteristics (since exact values from the study are not provided):

- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (less likely to have these traits in CS professors)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) = 0.8 \) (more likely to have these traits in humanities professors)

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, we calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.75)}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.
