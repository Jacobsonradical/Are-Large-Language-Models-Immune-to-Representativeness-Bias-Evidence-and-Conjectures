To approach this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the evidence provided in the description.

First, let's denote:
- \( C \) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as Jason being a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) \) = prior probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability that a randomly selected professor is in the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \) = probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, these traits might be more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors. However, without specific probabilities for these likelihoods, we're still able to reason qualitatively.

Assuming the description fits better with humanities professors:
- Let's assume \( P(D|C) \) is low, say 0.1.
- Let's assume \( P(D|H) \) is higher, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

To find \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Putting the numbers in:

\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625
\]

Now, calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\text{{probability}}: 0.04
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

\{"probability": "0.04"\}
