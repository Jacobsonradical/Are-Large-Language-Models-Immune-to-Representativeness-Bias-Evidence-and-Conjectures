To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's break it down:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

- For the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we need to make an assumption based on the description provided. Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with the traits typically associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors, though this is subjective. 

Suppose we estimate:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (low likelihood for computer science)
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.5 \] (higher likelihood for humanities)

Now we calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.375 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.0625 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0625.
