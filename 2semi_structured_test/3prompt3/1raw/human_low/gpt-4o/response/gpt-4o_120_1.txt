To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason’s description.

Let's start with the known quantities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science. There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate:
3. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason’s description, whether he is a computer science or humanities professor.

Since Jason's description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, these traits might be more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors. Without specific data about the likelihoods, a reasonable assumption would be that:
- \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively high.

Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) and \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|\neg A) * P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.7 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) ≈ 0.0455 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0455.
