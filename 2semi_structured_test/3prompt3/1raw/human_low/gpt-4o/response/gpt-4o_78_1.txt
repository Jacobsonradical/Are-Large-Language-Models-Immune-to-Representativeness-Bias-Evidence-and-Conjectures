To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll need to apply Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or description given.

Let's define the terms specifically for this problem:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description occurring.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A)):** There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Probability (P(\neg A)):** The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A) and P(B|\neg A)):** We need to assess how likely the description is for computer science professors and humanities professors. Given that the description seems to align more with typical traits associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical), we might estimate the likelihoods as follows:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.9 \]

4. **Total Probability (P(B)):** This accounts for the description across both groups.
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

5. **Posterior Probability (P(A|B)):**
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
