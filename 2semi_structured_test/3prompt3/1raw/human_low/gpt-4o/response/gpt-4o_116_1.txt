To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here are the given numbers:
- The number of computer science professors: 25
- The number of humanities professors: 75
- The total number of professors: 100

We'll use the following steps:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Hum}) \)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Assess the likelihood of Jason’s description given the type of professor. Jason’s description doesn’t strongly align with technical skills but does emphasize creativity and imagination, which are commonly associated with the humanities.

   - Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|\text{CS})\)): Let's assume this is low, e.g., 0.1
   - Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(D|\text{Hum})\)): Let's assume this is higher, e.g., 0.8

3. Use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
   \]

Substitute the probabilities into the formula:
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625
\]

Then,
\[
P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04
\]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.04.

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.04"}
