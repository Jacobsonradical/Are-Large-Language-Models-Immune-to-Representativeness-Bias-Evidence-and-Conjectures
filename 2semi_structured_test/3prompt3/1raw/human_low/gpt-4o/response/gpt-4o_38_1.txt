Let's start by considering the base rates given in the problem. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:

P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given the description of Jason, we need to update these probabilities. We must consider which traits fit better with each of the two professions. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical. These characteristics seem to align more closely with a humanities professor than a computer science professor who might be expected to be more technical.

However, without quantitative data on the likelihood of these traits in each group, we have to make a qualitative judgment. We qualitatively judge that the description of Jason fits more with typical traits of someone in the humanities rather than computer science.

So let's denote:
P(Description | CS) = Low (assign an arbitrary low value)
P(Description | Hum) = High (assign an arbitrary high value)

In a Bayesian update, we need to calculate the posterior probabilities. Since the chosen description seems to align better with humanities professors, we can intuitively assume the likelihood P(Description | Hum) is higher than P(Description | CS).

Given P(Hum) is also higher to begin with, we'll have a lower posterior for P(CS | Description).

Using Bayesian reasoning without exact figures:
P(CS | Description) < P(Hum | Description)

Given our initial base rates and the qualitative judgment of likelihoods, we might estimate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor as significantly lower than the base rate. 

A reasonable estimate given the qualitative judgment would be:

{"probability": "0.1"}
