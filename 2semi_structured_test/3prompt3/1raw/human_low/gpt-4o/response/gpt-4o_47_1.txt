To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

We need to consider:
1. The prior probability \( P(A) \).
2. The probability \( P(B|A) \).
3. The probability \( P(B) \).

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):**
   The proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Probability of the Description Given CS Professor (\( P(B|A) \)):**
   This requires interpretive judgement about how likely a computer science professor fits the description. Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical), the description seems less typical for a computer science professor. Let’s subjectively assign:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \]

3. **Probability of the Description (\( P(B) \)):**
   This is a weighted average of the description probability over both groups:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   Where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

   \( P(\neg A) = 0.75 \) and subjectively, let’s assume:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.5 \]

   So,
   \[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.0625"}
