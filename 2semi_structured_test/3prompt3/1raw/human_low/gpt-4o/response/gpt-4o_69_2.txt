To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is 0.25 (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science).
   - The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is 0.75 (since 75 out of 100 professors are in humanities).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)).
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)).

To proceed further accurately, one would typically need detailed likelihood values (\(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|Hum)\)) based on the specific traits of the described personality. Nonetheless, given the general description provided, Jason being characterized as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" fits more stereotypically with humanities professors than with computer science professors (who might be expected to lean more towards technical traits).

Given this contextual information, let's make a reasonable assumption:

- Assume \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\)
- Assume \(P(D|Hum) = 0.8\)

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description appearing in either group:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, calculate \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac(0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is approximately 0.077.
