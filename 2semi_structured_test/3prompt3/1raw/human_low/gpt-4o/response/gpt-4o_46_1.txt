To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step overview:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (P(D | CS)).
    - The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (P(D | H)).

Based on Jason's description as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical, we can make educated guesses about these likelihoods:
- P(D | CS): Jason's description does not strongly match typical stereotypes of computer science professors, who might be expected to be more technical. So, this likelihood could be relatively low.
- P(D | H): Jason's description aligns more with humanities professors, who may be more expected to be creative and imaginative. Therefore, this likelihood can be higher.

However, without specific numerical data for P(D | CS) and P(D | H), we can qualitatively state:
- P(D | CS) < P(D | H).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{Posterior probability} (P(CS | D)) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since P(D | CS) < P(D | H):
- Assume P(D | CS) = 0.1 (low probability as the description does not fit the stereotypical computer science professor).
- Assume P(D | H) = 0.9 (high probability as the description fits typical humanities professor traits).

Now, calculate:
\[ \text{Posterior probability} (P(CS | D)) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
