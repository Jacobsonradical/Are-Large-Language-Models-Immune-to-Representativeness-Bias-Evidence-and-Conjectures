First, let's establish the prior probabilities (priors) for Jason being a computer science (CS) professor or a humanities professor. There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors, so the priors are:

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's profile fitting each category. The description provided suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits may be more commonly associated with humanities professors than with CS professors.

For simplicity, let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) as the likelihood of a CS professor having the provided description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) as the likelihood of a humanities professor having the provided description.

It's reasonable to assume that the likelihood of a humanities professor having these traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical) is higher than a CS professor having these traits.

Let's assign subjective probabilities for these likelihoods based on the description:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update our belief given the description:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring in the overall population:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Finally, we calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: \text{"0.036"}
\]

Therefore:
{"probability": "0.036"}
