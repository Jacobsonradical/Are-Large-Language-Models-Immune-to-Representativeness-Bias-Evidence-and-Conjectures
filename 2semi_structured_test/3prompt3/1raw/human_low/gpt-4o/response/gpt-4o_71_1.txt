To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here is the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probability \( P(A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, assume a simplified approach for the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) given the qualitative description:
- The description provided does not particularly sound technical but rather fits creative and imaginative traits which might be more common in humanities.
  - We'll estimate \( P(B|A) \), the probability of this description being that of a computer science professor, as relatively low, say 0.1 for the sake of argument.
  - We'll estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of this description being that of a humanities professor, as relatively high, say 0.7 for the sake of argument.

Finally, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0455 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.0455"} \]
