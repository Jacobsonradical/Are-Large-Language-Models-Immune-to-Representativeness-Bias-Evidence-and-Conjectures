To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, our prior beliefs include:

1. The fraction of computer science professors in the sample.
2. The likelihood of a professor fitting Jason's description given their field.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(Humanities) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description provided is more typical for a humanities professor than a computer science professor (given that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, etc.), let's denote:

- \( P(description | CS) \) as the probability of the description for a CS professor.
- \( P(description | Humanities) \) as the probability of the description for a humanities professor.

Without exact probabilities, we make an educated guess here. Let's assume that:
- \( P(description | CS) = 0.1 \) (low because the description is not typical for CS professors).
- \( P(description | Humanities) = 0.9 \) (high because the description fits humanities professors well).

Bayes' theorem formula for posterior probability \( P(CS | description) \):

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description under both fields:

\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.7 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.036"} \]
