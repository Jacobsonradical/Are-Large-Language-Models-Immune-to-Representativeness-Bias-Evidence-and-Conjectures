To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:

- \( C \) for the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( H \) for the event that Jason is a humanities professor,
- \( D \) for the description given.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the descriptions given the two categories.

1. The prior probabilities:
   - \( P(C) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. Next, we'll make some assumptions about the likelihoods based on the description:
   - Typical descriptions of humanities professors are more aligned with being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven while not being particularly technical.
   - Typical descriptions of computer science professors might be more inclined towards technical skills and logical reasoning rather than emotional and creative expressions.

Given the description provided, it seems more likely to match a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Let's assume:

   - \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor, is quite high, say \( 0.9 \) (or 90%).
   - \( P(D|C) \), the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor, is lower, say \( 0.2 \) (or 20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) can be found by the law of total probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Now, plug in the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.05 + 0.675
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.725
\]

Finally, calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.725}
\]

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.725}
\]

\[
P(C|D) \approx 0.069
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.069.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.069"}}
\]
