To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we must apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description \( D \).

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Similarly, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Based on the description, Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." This suggests characteristics more aligned with the humanities rather than computer science.
   - Therefore, the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) is expected to be higher than \( P(D|C) \).
   - Let's denote \( P(D|C) = x \) and \( P(D|H) = y \). Since it's more likely that Jason is a humanities professor, we assume \( y > x \).

3. **Marginal Probability:**
   - \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = x \cdot 0.25 + y \cdot 0.75 \)

Let's assume specific values for illustration purposes, for example, \( x = 0.1 \) and \( y = 0.8 \):

\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
