To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll need to apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided of Jason.

We know that:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A = \text{CS professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A = \text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To compute \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we'll need to make some assumptions based on the description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and gifted but not particularly technical. These traits seem more typical for a humanities professor than a computer science professor, who we might think of as more technical.

Assuming:
- \( P(B|A = \text{CS professor}) = 0.1 \) (as these traits are less typical for CS professors)
- \( P(B|\neg A = \text{Humanities professor}) = 0.9 \) (as these traits are more typical for humanities professors)

Now, we need the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.036"} \]
