To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being written about a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- The probability that one of the professors chosen at random is a computer science professor (\(P(A)\)) is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
- The probability that one of the professors chosen at random is a humanities professor is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

Next, we consider the likelihoods:
- The description indicates that Jason is more aligned with humanities professors than with technical fields like computer science.
- Let's assume that the probability of a humanities professor fitting this description (\(P(B | \text{humanities})\)) is higher than for a computer science professor (\(P(B | \text{CS})\)).

Given the indication in the description, let's say:
- \( P(B | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \) (it is rare for a computer science professor to fit this description)
- \( P(B | \text{humanities}) = 0.9 \) (it is common for a humanities professor to fit this description)

Finally, \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B | \text{humanities}) \cdot P(\text{humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357 or 3.57%.

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.0357"}
