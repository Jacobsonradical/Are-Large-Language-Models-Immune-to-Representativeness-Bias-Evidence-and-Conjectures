To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. Let's define the following:

- \( P(C | D) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | C) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the numbers from the problem:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

To compute the posterior, we also need to consider the likelihoods \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
- \( P(D | C) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that he aligns with traits typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven). Thus, we can make a qualitative assumption that Jason fits better with the profile of a humanities professor.

However, without precise numerical values for these likelihoods, we must make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume that:
- \( P(D | C) \): The probability that such a description fits a computer science professor, let's say it is low, around 0.1.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability that such a description fits a humanities professor, is higher, let's say around 0.9.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
Where
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(C | D) \):
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
