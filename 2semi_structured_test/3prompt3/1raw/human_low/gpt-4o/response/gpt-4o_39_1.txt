To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( S_{CS} \): The event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( S_{H} \): The event that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(S_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | S_{CS}) P(S_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate each term:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(S_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors).
   - \( P(S_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(D | S_{CS}) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | S_{H}) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description states Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring" and "not particularly technical," it is more likely that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

We can make a subjective estimate based on the given description:

- Let's assume \( P(D | S_{CS}) \) is low because the description does not fit the typical technical profile of a computer science professor. We will assign a low value, say \( 0.2 \).
- Let's assume \( P(D | S_{H}) \) is higher because the description fits more closely with a humanities professor. We will assign a higher value, say \( 0.8 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | S_{CS}) P(S_{CS}) + P(D | S_{H}) P(S_{H}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Using these values in Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(S_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | S_{CS}) P(S_{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(S_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(S_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(S_{CS} | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
