To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability Jason is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Without loss of generality, let us make a simplifying assumption that the description's likelihood for computer science and humanities professors can be estimated.

Given the description:
- Jason does not appear to fit the stereotypical profile of a highly technical and logical individual that might be more common in computer science.
- Jason's creative, imaginative, and emotional attributes align more closely with the typical profile of a humanities professor.

Based on this qualitative judgment, let's use the following likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor, which might be considered relatively low, say 0.2.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, which might be considered relatively high, say 0.8.

Now we can calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
