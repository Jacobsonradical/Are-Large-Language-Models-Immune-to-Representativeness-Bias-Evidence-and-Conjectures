To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(\mathrm{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\mathrm{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(\mathrm{Description}| \mathrm{CS}) \)
   - \( P(\mathrm{Description}| \mathrm{Humanities}) \)
   
Given Jason's description, we should assess how likely such a description would be for professors in each field. The description given suggests creative, imaginative, emotionally driven traits which might slightly lean towards humanities professors.

While we do not have exact likelihood values, we can reasonably assume that such descriptions are less common for computer science professors and more common for humanities professors.

For the sake of this solution, let's assign subjective likelihood values:
   - \( P(\mathrm{Description}| \mathrm{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(\mathrm{Description}| \mathrm{Humanities}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Posterior Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(\mathrm{CS} | \mathrm{Description}) = \frac{P(\mathrm{Description} | \mathrm{CS}) \cdot P(\mathrm{CS})}{P(\mathrm{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\mathrm{Description}) = P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{CS}) \cdot P(\mathrm{CS}) + P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{Humanities}) \cdot P(\mathrm{Humanities}) \]

Let's calculate:
\[ P(\mathrm{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Thus,
\[ P(\mathrm{CS} | \mathrm{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ \text{{{"probability": "0.036"}}} \]
