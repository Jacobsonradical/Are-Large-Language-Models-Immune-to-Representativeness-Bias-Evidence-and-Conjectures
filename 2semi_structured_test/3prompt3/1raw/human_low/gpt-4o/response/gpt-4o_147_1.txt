Given the provided description and the initial set-up of the problem, let's calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.

First, we need to outline the relevant probabilities:

1. The prior probability of picking a computer science professor (CS) out of the whole sample:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   
2. The prior probability of picking a humanities professor (H) out of the whole sample:
   \[
   P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \), which involve some subjective judgment based on the given description.

- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, attributes that might be more commonly associated with humanities professors.

For the sake of estimation, let's assign the likelihoods as follows:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) = 0.1 (since the description is less likely for a computer science professor based on the detailed personality traits)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \) = 0.9 (since the description is more likely for a humanities professor given the creativity and emotional aspect)

Finally, we'll apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \(P(\text{Description})\) is calculated as:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
\]

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)
\]

\[
P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Then the posterior probability is:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately \( 0.0357 \).

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.0357"}
