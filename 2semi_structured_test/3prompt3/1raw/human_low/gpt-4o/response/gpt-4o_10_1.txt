To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) = Description matches Jason.

We want to find \( P(C | D) \).

Starting with Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to compare the probabilities of the description matching a computer science professor versus a humanities professor using the following steps:

1. **Base Rates (Prior Probabilities)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(C) \) (the probability of choosing a computer science professor without any description) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) (the probability of choosing a humanities professor without any description) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D | C) \): the probability that we observe the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | H) \): the probability that we observe the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description provided:
- "Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" traits are more stereotypically aligned with humanities professors.
- "Not particularly technical" suggests less likelihood of being a computer science professor.

Assuming that the description matches a humanities professor more closely than it matches a computer science professor, let's make reasonable estimations of the likelihoods:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.2 \) (a moderately low likelihood).
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (a high likelihood).

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(C | D) \):
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.077 \).

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.077"}
