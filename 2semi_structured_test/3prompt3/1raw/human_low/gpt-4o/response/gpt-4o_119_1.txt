To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Given the prior probabilities:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the marginal probability of the description, which is a weighted sum of the likelihoods across both groups: \(P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)\).

The crucial part here is estimating \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\):

Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate but not particularly technical), this fits more commonly with humanities professors based on typical stereotypes. So, we assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\): The probability that this description fits a computer science professor can be assumed to be lower, e.g., around 0.1.
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability that this description fits a humanities professor can be higher, e.g., around 0.9.

Using these estimates:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
