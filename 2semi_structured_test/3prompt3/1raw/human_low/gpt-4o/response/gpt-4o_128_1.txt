To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**:
   Given the sample, there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability of Humanities Professors \(P(A')\)**:
   Similarly, there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so:
   \[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)**:
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason does not appear to have technical traits commonly associated with computer science professors and aligns more with traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring) that might be more typical in humanities. So, we might assume a lower probability for this, say:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \]

4. **Likelihood \(P(B|A')\)**:
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. The description seems more fitting of a humanities professor, thus:
   \[ P(B|A') = 0.9 \]

5. **Total Probability \(P(B)\)**:
   The law of total probability gives us:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A')
   \]
   Substituting the numbers in, we get:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

6. **Posterior Probability \(P(A|B)\)**:
   Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
