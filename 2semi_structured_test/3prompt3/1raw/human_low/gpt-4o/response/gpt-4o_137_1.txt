To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we note the following probabilities:
- Prior probability \( P(C) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \), we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given the description of Jason, it emphasizes creativity, imagination, and being emotionally driven, which are typically more associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Therefore:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. This is likely low.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. This is likely high.

For the sake of estimation:
- Assume \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \)
- Assume \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \)

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.0357 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
