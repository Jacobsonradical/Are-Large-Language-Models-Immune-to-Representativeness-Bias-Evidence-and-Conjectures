To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. The information given provides us with certain prior probabilities and likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   Since 25 out of the 100 professors are from computer science, this probability is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability (P(H))**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   Since 75 out of the 100 professors are from the humanities, this probability is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood of Jason's Description for CS Professor (P(D|CS))**: This is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. 

4. **Likelihood of Jason's Description for Humanities Professor (P(D|H))**: This is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." These traits seem more aligned with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

For the purpose of calculating the posterior probability, let's make some reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods:

- Assume the likelihood of Jason fitting the description, given he is a humanities professor, is high, say \(P(D|H) = 0.8\).
- Assume the likelihood of Jason fitting the description, given he is a computer science professor, is low, say \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of observing Jason's description regardless of his field. This can be calculated as:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.625
\]

So now we can calculate \(P(CS|D)\):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = 0.04
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
