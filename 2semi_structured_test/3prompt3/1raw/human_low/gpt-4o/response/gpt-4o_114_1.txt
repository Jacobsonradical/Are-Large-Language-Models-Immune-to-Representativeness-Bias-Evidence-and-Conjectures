This is a problem of conditional probability, where we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his described traits.

We use Bayes' Theorem to solve this:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description \(D\) given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description \(D\).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We don't have exact likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), but we can infer based on the description which aligns more with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical).

Assuming:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\) (low because traits are less typical of CS)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) (high because traits are more typical of humanities)

The overall probability \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
