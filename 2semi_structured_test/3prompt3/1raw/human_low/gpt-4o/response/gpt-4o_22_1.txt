To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - The total number of professors is 100.

   The prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

   The prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to assess the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) and a humanities professor (P(Description | H)).

   Based on the description, it seems more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and not particularly technical. These traits are stereotypically more common in the humanities than in computer science.

   For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
   \[
   P(Description | CS) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(Description | H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \(P(CS | Description)\):

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Similarly, \(P(H | Description)\):

   \[
   P(H | Description) = \frac{P(Description | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   We also need \(P(Description)\):

   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   \[
   P(Description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Now plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.0357"}}
\]
