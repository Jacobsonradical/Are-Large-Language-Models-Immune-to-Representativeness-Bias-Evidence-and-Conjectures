To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

Given the setup, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \(P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Without detailed information on the exact likelihoods, we have to make a subjective estimate based on the description. The description of Jason suggests traits that might be relatively rare among computer science professors and more common among humanities professors. However, let's continue using probabilities.

Assuming:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor) might be low, say 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) might be higher, say 0.9.

We can calculate \( P(B) \) as follows:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Thus, the answer is:
