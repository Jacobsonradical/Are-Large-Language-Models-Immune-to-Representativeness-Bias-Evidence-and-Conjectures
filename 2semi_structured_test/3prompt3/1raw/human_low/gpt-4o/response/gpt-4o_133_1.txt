To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's assign probabilities to our terms:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). 

Given the description's details, it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) than a computer science professor. 

So, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (assuming that such a description is less likely, but not impossible, for a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \) (such a description is much more likely for a humanities professor)

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description is approximately 0.0357.
