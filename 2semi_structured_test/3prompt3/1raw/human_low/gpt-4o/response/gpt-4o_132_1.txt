To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the given description.

Given:
- P(A): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- P(not A): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|not A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a computer science professor matches Jason’s description.
- \( P(B|not A) \): The probability that a humanities professor matches Jason’s description.

The description of Jason suggests characteristics (creative, imaginative, passionate, non-technical) that might be more common in humanities professors. Therefore, lets roughly assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|not A) = 0.9 \)

Now we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|not A) \cdot P(not A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.036.
