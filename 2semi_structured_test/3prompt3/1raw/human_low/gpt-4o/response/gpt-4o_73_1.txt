To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Here’s the structure:

Bayes' theorem is stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let’s define the terms:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) = Description given

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

Step 1: Identify prior probabilities (\( P(A) \) and \( P(A^C) \)):
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of being a computer science professor = 25/(25+75) = 0.25
- \( P(A^C) \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor = 75/(25+75) = 0.75

Step 2: Assess the likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \)):
- The description suggests someone who "is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring... gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.” These traits are presumably more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.
- Let’s estimate: \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) and \( P(B|A^C) = 0.6 \). (Note that these are subjective and hypothetical as we don’t have the actual numbers from the study).

Step 3: Calculate the evidence (\( P(B) \)):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^C) \cdot P(A^C) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.45 = 0.475 \]

Step 4: Apply Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.0526" \]
