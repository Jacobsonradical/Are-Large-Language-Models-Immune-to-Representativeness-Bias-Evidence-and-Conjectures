To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates (priors) of the two groups of professors and the likelihood of Jason's description fitting each group.

1. Base rate probability of selecting a computer science professor:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Base rate probability of selecting a humanities professor:
   \[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the given description, Jason appears to have traits more commonly associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical).

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our priors to posteriors:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]
\[
P(Hum|D) = \frac{P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(D)}
\]

However, we need some estimates for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). Since Jason's description fits humanities traits strongly, we might reasonably estimate:
\[
P(D|CS) = 0.1 \quad \text{(Jason has a 10% chance of fitting the description if he is in CS)}
\]
\[
P(D|Hum) = 0.7 \quad \text{(Jason has a 70% chance of fitting the description if he is in humanities)}
\]

Finally, the total probability of the description, \( P(D) \), can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55
\]

Now, we can compute the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.0455 \approx 0.046 \text{(rounded to three decimal places)}
\]

So, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.046"\} \]
