To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines the prior probability with the likelihood of the observed evidence under each hypothesis. 

Let's define the relevant quantities:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the observed description of Jason.

We need \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

To simplify our calculations, we first need some logical estimates:
- The prior probability \( P(C) \) is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
  \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The total probability \( P(D) \) is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description of Jason and the typical traits of computer science and humanities professors, we need to assess the likelihoods:
- The traits described align more closely with typical humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, estimate:
  \[ P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \]
  \[ P(D|H) \approx 0.5 \]

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.375 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.4 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.0625 \]

So, my posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
{"probability": "0.0625"}
