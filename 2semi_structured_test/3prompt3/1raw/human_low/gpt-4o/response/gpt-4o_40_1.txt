To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods. Although we don't have exact values, we can make a reasoned judgment given the description:
- The description suggests qualities more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

Since we don't have precise values for likelihoods, we'll assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is somewhat low because the description seems less typical of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is higher because the description seems more typical of a humanities professor.

Let's assume reasonable likelihoods for illustrative purposes:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can apply these values to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
