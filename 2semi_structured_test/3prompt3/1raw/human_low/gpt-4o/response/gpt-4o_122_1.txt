To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

where:  
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).  
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.  
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in computer science.  
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.  
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in humanities.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:  
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.  
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.  

So:  
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]  
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description of Jason, he does not seem particularly technical, and his interests and personality traits align more closely with someone in the humanities. We can reasonably assume that \( P(D|CS) \) might be lower compared to \( P(D|H) \).

Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (a somewhat lower probability since the description does not fit the typical technical profile), and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (a higher probability since the description fits the humanities profile well).

We can now plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:  

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.0769"} \]
