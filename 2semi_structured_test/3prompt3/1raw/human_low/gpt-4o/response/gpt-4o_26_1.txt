To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\(A_1\)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\(A_2\)).

Thus:
\[ P(A_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate \( P(B|A_1) \) and \( P(B|A_2) \), the probabilities of the description given the respective categories.

Given Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical), these seem more characteristic of humanities professors than of computer science professors. Thus, while this is a subjective assessment, it's reasonable to assume:
\[ P(B|A_1) \text{ (computer science)} \] is small, let's estimate: \( 0.2 \)
\[ P(B|A_2) \text{ (humanities)} \] is larger, let's estimate: \( 0.8 \)

We also need the normalization constant \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.05) + (0.6) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now we can calculate:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.077"\}} \]
