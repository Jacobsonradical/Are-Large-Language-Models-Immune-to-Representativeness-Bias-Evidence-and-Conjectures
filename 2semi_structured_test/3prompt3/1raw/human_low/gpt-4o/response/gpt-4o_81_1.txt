To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's define the prior probabilities and relevant likelihoods based on the sample:
- The prior probability \( P(C) \) that Jason is a computer science professor:
  \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
  
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:
  \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), which are the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science or a humanities professor, respectively. The description of Jason seems to align more with traits stereotypically associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not particularly technical).

For simplicity, let's assume that:
- \( P(D \mid C) = 0.1 \) since the description fits less with what we might expect from a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.9 \) since the description fits more with what we might expect from a humanities professor.

The marginal likelihood \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
