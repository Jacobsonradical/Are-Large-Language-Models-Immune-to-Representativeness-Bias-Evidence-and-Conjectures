To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Here's the breakdown of each term:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from humanities, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \):
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \): the probability that a randomly chosen computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \): the probability that a randomly chosen humanities professor fits Jason's description.

Given Jason's characteristics, such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate (but not particularly technical), these traits seem more aligned with the typical description of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.

Thus, we might infer:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is low.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) is high.

Qualitatively, let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \) (an estimate based on the given traits not typically aligning with a CS professor).
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \).

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1) \cdot (0.25) + (0.9) \cdot (0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.25)}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.036"} \]
