First, let's apply Bayes' theorem to update our probability based on the given description. Bayes' theorem is given as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of the description.

We start with the priori probabilities:
- \(P(A)\): probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The complementary probability \(P(A^c)\): probability of Jason being one of the humanities professors = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \(P(B|A)\): the likelihood of this description being for a computer science professor
- \(P(B|A^c)\): the likelihood of this description being for a humanities professor

Given the description, it sounds more probable that Jason is a humanities professor because the traits ("creative and imaginative", "emotionally driven", "not particularly technical‚Äù) seem to align more with the humanities than with computer science, where technical skills are typically emphasized.

To quantify:
- Let's assume \(P(B|A)\) is low compared to \(P(B|A^c)\). Arbitrarily setting:
  - \(P(B|A)\) = 0.2 (reflects low probability though not absolutely negligible)
  - \(P(B|A^c)\) = 0.8 (reflects higher probability due to alignment of the description with humanities)

Now, we can calculate \(P(B)\) using the law of total probability:
\[P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)\]
\[P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75\]
\[P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65\]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:

{"probability": "0.077"}
