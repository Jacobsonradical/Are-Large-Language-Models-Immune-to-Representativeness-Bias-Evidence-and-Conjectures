To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is stated mathematically as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis A given the evidence B (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of evidence B given hypothesis A (the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis A (the initial probability that Jason is a computer science professor without any given description).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the evidence B (the overall probability of the description).

Let's define the hypotheses:
- \( H_{cs} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{hum} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(H_{cs}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(H_{hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate \( P(B|H_{cs}) \) and \( P(B|H_{hum}) \):
- \( P(B|H_{cs}) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|H_{hum}) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, "creative, imaginative, passionate, and not particularly technical" aligns more with common stereotypes of humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, we might estimate the probabilities:

Let's say that:
- \( P(B|H_{cs}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|H_{hum}) \approx 0.9 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{cs}|B) = \frac{P(B|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) = P(B|H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(B|H_{hum}) \cdot P(H_{hum}) \):

\[
P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(H_{cs}|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Rounding to four decimal places:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
