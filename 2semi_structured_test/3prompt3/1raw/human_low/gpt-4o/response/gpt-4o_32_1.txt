Given the description of Jason, we need to update our belief about the probability that he is a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor using Bayesian reasoning.

Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that he is a humanities professor. We want to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

First, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

From the problem, we know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, out of a total of 100 professors:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we assess \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Based on the description of Jason, it seems less likely that he is a technical individual. His traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) are more typically associated with humanities professors. This suggests:

- \( P(D \mid C) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is relatively high.

Since we are not given exact probabilities for \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we can make educated guesses based on the characterization.

Let's say \( P(D \mid C) = 0.1 \) (10%) given the less technical and more creative nature, and \( P(D \mid H) = 0.9 \) (90%).

Now we calculate the total probability of the description \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
