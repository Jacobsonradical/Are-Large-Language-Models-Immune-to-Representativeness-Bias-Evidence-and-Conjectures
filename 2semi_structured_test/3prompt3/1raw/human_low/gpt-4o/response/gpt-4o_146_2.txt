To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).

Next, we need to approximate the likelihood \( P(B|A) \). Let's assume:

- \( P(B|CS) \) is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|Hum) \) is the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Since the description highlights creativity, imagination, and emotional drive and states that Jason is not particularly technical, it aligns more closely with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood due to less alignment with typical computer science traits).
- \( P(B|Hum) \approx 0.8 \) (higher likelihood due to more alignment with humanities traits).

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
