To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to define our variables and their respective probabilities:
1. \( P(CS) \) - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|CS) \) - The probability of the given description (D) given that the professor is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \) - The probability of the given description (D) given that the professor is a humanities professor.

From the problem:
- 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- 75 out of 100 professors are from the humanities, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to determine \( P(D) \), the overall probability of the description D, which is given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

And we need \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description D, which is given by Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given the description mentions traits such as creativity, imaginative tendencies, emotional drive, and passion, it suggests that Jason might fit more with the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. We can reasonably assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) \), the probability of this description among computer science professors, is quite low due to the description not fitting the typical stereotype of a technical professor.
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability of this description among humanities professors, is higher because humanities academics are often associated with creativity and passion.

Let's assign reasonable probabilities to these subjective assessments:
- Assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) - a low but non-zero probability for computer science.
- Assume \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \) - a high probability for humanities.

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.045 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
