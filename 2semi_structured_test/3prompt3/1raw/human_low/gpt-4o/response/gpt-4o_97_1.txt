To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing Jason's description regardless of his field.

Here’s how we can apply these steps:

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complement Prior Probability (\(P(A')\))**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A) and P(B|A'))**:
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description if he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A') \) is the probability of Jason’s description if he is a humanities professor.

In practice, detailed information of how typical the description is for either group might be given by the distributions from the personality tests, but let’s assume a few simple scenarios for these probabilities based on common stereotypes and the description provided:
   - Let’s assume Jason fits better with the humanities profile given his creative and emotionally driven traits and that this type of description is more common among humanities professors.
   - For simplicity, we might assume:
     - \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (since these traits are less common in computer science).
     - \( P(B|A') = 0.5 \) (since these traits are more common in humanities).

4. **Total Probability (P(B))**:
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4 \)

5. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' formula:
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625 \)

Therefore,
