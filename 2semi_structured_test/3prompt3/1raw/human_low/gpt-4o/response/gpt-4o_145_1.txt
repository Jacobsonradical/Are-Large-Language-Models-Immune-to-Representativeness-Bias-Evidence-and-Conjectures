To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the relevant terms:

- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) = probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) = probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor
- \( P(CS|D) \) = posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description

We have:

- \( P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \)

Since the description suggests traits that are more common among humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we can reasonably assume that:

- \( P(D|H) \) is higher than \( P(D|CS) \)

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (conservatively low given the description is not typical for a CS professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (conservatively high given the description matches typical humanities traits)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.036"}
