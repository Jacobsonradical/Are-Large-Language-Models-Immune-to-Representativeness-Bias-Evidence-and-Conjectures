To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given data:
1. There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
2. There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
3. The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) (being in humanities) are:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\( P(D) \), the overall probability of the description, is a weighted sum of the likelihoods for computer science and humanities:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assumptions (based on the description):
- Jason's described traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.) are more typical for humanities professors than computer science professors.
- For simplicity, let's assign some reasonable likelihood values based on the description: 
  - \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (low, because the description doesn't match typical CS traits)
  - \( P(D|H) = 0.4 \) (higher, because it matches common humanities traits)

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.325 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem to get \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

So, we can conclude that the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.077, or 7.7%.

Here is the final answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.077"}
