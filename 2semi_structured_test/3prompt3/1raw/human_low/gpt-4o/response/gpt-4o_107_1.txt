To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This involves updating our prior beliefs (the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample) with the likelihood of the description given that he belongs to each group.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates):**
   - Probability of computer science professor (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of humanities professor (H): \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - While we haven't been given exact probabilities (likelihoods) for the description fitting computer science versus humanities professors, we can make a reasonable assumption based on common stereotypes or typical characteristics. Jason's description emphasizes creativity, emotional drive, and lack of technical interest, which might be more commonly associated with the humanities than with computer science.

    Let's assume the following likelihoods based on the description:
   - Likelihood of the description if CS professor: \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (since not particularly technical seems less likely for a CS prof)
   - Likelihood of the description if H professor: \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \) (since creativity and emotional drive are more aligned with humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

   Now, calculating the posterior probability:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.036, or 3.6%.

Following the specified format:
{"probability": "0.036"}
