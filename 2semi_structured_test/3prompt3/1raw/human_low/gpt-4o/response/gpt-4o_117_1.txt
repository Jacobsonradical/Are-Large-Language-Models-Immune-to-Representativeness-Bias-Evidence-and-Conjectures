To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

From the information provided:
- There are 100 professors in total.
- 25 are computer science professors, and 75 are humanities professors.

Let's assign:
- \( A_{CS} \) to the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{H} \) to the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We have:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need an estimate for \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \), the likelihoods of the description given Jason's field.

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with the common stereotype of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's make an informed estimate:
- Assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.2 \), a relatively low likelihood as the description doesn't fit the typical technical profile of a computer science professor.
- Assume \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0.8 \), a higher likelihood as the description fits well with typical humanities profiles.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now compute \( P(A_{CS}|B) \):
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.0769.
