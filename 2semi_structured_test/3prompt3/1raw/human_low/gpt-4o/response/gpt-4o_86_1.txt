To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We are looking for \( P(C | D) \). According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine the following:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \)**:
   - The number of computer science professors: 25
   - The number of humanities professors: 75
   - Total number of professors: 100

   Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \)**:
   - This involves how likely the description of Jason fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   - The description mentions traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and not being particularly technical. These traits are generally more stereotypically aligned with humanities professors.

   While we don't have exact numbers, we can reason that:
   \[ P(D | H) > P(D | C) \]

3. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(D) \)**: 
   - This is the total probability of the description, Jason fitting either a computer science or a humanities professor.
   \[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | H) \) is higher than \( P(D | C) \), and considering \( P(H) \) is also larger than \( P(C) \), the overall probability that Jason is a humanities professor is likely higher.

However, without precise values for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we can only make a qualitative estimate. Given the substantial leaning of the description towards characteristics that are more likely found in humanities professors, we can assign a lower, but non-zero probability to Jason being a computer science professor.

Let's assume a typical ratio seen in such cases could lean heavily towards humanities, say \( P(D | C) \approx 0.1 \) and \( P(D | H) \approx 0.9 \) as subjective placeholders for strong artistic and non-technical inclination.

Finally, combining all the information:

\[ P(C | D) \approx \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \approx 0.036 \]

So, in the required format:

{"probability": "0.036"}
