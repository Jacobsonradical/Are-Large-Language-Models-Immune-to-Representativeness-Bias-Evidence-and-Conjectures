To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability:** 
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (prior), \( P(CS) \): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (prior), \( P(H) \): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood:** 
   - The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \)
   - The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \)

Since we don't have explicit likelihood values from the study, we'll make an educated guess based on the description. Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.) tend to align more with the typical humanities profile than computer science. Therefore:

   - Let's assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) 
   - Let's assume \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** 
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.
