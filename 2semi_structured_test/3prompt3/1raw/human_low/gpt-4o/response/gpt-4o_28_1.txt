To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Prior probability**: Initially, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
and the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**: We need to evaluate how likely it is that Jason's personality description fits a CS professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the description provided, Jason appears to be more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying reading and exploring, not particularly technical).

3. **Posterior probability**: Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

Given that Jason’s description aligns more with traits associated with humanities professors, this suggests that:
\[ P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) < P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \]

We can simplify this by noting that the overall posterior probability is influenced by how much weight we give to Jason's fit with humanities traits versus CS traits.

For simplicity, assume:
\[ P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \approx 0.9 \]

Now, let’s calculate the denominator \( P(\text{Jason's description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = 0.7 \]

Now calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.0357, or about 3.57%.

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.0357"\}} \]
