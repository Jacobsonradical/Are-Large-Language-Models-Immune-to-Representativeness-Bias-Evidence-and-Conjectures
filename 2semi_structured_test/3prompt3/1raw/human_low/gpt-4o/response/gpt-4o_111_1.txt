To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(H_{CS}\) be the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_{Hum}\) be the hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(E\) be the evidence provided by Jason's description.

We need to calculate \(P(H_{CS}|E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H_{CS})\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E|H_{CS})\) is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And \( P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, consider the likelihoods:
- Given Jason's description, it is more likely that he is a humanities professor due to his interests and traits (creative, imaginative, exploratory, emotional, non-technical).
- Let's assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (low probability since the description doesn't match typical traits of computer science professors).
- And \( P(E|H_{Hum}) = 0.6 \) (higher probability since the description better matches typical traits of humanities professors).

Now, calculate the total probability of observing the description \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.45 = 0.475 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
