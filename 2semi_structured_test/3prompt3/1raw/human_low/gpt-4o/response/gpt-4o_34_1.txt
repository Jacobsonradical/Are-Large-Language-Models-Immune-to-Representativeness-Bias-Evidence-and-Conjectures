To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We start with some given information:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We have a random description of Jason, whose traits are creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted, and passionate, but not particularly technical.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is from each of the two groups. Since Jason is described as "not particularly technical," which is relatively more characteristic of humanities professors compared to computer science professors, we expect:

- The likelihood \( P(description | CS) \) to be low for computer science professors.
- The likelihood \( P(description | H) \) to be higher for humanities professors.

Let's say, based on a subjective estimation, the likelihoods might be:
- \( P(description | CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(description | H) = 0.9 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

We need the denominator \( P(description) \):
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | description) â‰ˆ 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on his description, is approximately:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.04"}} \]

(Note: Approximating to two decimal places for simplicity in reporting.)
