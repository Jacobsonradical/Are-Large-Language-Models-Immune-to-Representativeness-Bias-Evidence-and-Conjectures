To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a computer science professor and the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a typical computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

### Base Rate (Prior Probability)
There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

### Likelihood
Next, we evaluate how likely Jason's description fits each group.

Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.‚Äù These characteristics seem more aligned with someone in the humanities than in computer science.

Let's denote:
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})\) as the probability Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})\) as the probability Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1
\]

\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9
\]

### Posterior Calculation
Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \(P(\text{Description})\) can be obtained by:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]

\[
P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.0357"
\]
