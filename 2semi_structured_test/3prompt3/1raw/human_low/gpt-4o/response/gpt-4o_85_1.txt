To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our goal).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's outline the given information and make reasonable assumptions:
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(B|C) \) and \( P(B|H) \), which are the probabilities of the description for both computer science and humanities professors respectively.

The description provided does not appear to be highly technical and highlights creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, which are often more associated with humanities. Therefore, let's assume plausible probabilities:

- \( P(B|C) \), the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor, is likely low, given the less technical and more creative attributes. We might assume it to be around 0.1.
- \( P(B|H) \), the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor, is likely higher. We might assume it to be around 0.7.

To calculate \( P(B) \), the probability of the description in general, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[
P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55
\]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C|B) = \frac{P(B|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.045
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.045.
