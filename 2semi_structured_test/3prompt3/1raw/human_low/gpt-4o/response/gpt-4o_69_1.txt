To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem connects the prior probability with the likelihood of the observed evidence under different hypotheses. Here are the relevant steps and numbers:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that the randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that the randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H) is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given each hypothesis:
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \): The likelihood that a computer science professor fits the given description.
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \): The likelihood that a humanities professor fits the given description.

Based on the description, it seems more fitting of the typical characteristics associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate but not particularly technical). We can intuitively assign:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \) a lower value, say 0.2 (less likely for CS professors).
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \) a higher value, say 0.8 (more likely for humanities professors).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Plugging into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.077" \]
