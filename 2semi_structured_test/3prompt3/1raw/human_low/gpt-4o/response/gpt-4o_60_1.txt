To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we are trying to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality description.

Let's define our events:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: Jason is a humanities professor.

We're provided with the following information:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(B) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

Let's denote:
- D: Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven...").

We want to find P(A|D), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we have for the humanities professors:

\[ P(B|D) = \frac{P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(D)} \]

We need some assumptions because we don't have the exact probabilities of P(D|A) and P(D|B) in the problem statement.

Based on the description, Jason seems to have characteristics more typical of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring). These traits might be less common among computer science professors, who might be more technical and analytical.

Without exact probabilities, let's assume:
- P(D|A) = 0.2 (relatively low, reflecting that these traits are less typical for computer science professors)
- P(D|B) = 0.8 (relatively high, reflecting that these traits are more typical for humanities professors)

We calculate P(D) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]

So,

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|D):

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.077.

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
