To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Initial Probabilities (Prior)**:
   - Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)).
   - The likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)).

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical, it seems to align more with common stereotypes of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Thus, \(P(D|H)\) would logically be higher than \(P(D|CS)\).

Assuming a plausible likelihood ratio considering the description aligns more with stereotypes of humanities professors (subjectively), let's estimate:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\): a low but non-zero probability.
- \(P(D|H) = 0.5\): a reasonable probability given the description fits better.

3. **Normalization (Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem)**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of observing the description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.0625"
\]

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.0625"}}
\]
