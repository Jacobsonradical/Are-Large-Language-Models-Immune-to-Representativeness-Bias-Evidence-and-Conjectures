To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor

From the problem, we know the following priors:
- \( P(C) \) = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = 75/100 = 0.75

We'll need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \) = Probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor

Given Jason's characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems more likely these traits align more with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, without specific values, we will need to make an educated guess.

Let's assume that:
- \( P(D|C) \) = 0.2 (a low probability, since Jason does not fit the typical traits of a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \) = 0.8 (a higher probability, since Jason's traits are more aligned with professors in the humanities)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \) is calculated as:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Calculating \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now, calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0769.
