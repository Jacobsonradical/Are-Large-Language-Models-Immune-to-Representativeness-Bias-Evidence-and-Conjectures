To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here's how we can set it up:

- **Prior probability for a computer science professor (P(CS))**: There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- **Prior probability for a humanities professor (P(Hum))**: There are 75 humanities professors and 100 professors in total.
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- **Likelihood of the description given the professor is in computer science (P(Description | CS))**: This is subjective, but given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems less likely for a typical computer science professor. Let's assume a low value, such as 0.1.

- **Likelihood of the description given the professor is in humanities (P(Description | Hum))**: These traits seem to align more with the humanities. Let's assume a higher value, for instance, 0.9.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (P(CS | Description)):

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Substituting in our assumed values:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675}
\]

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}
\]

\[
P(CS | Description) \approx 0.0357
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.

The answer in the requested format is:
{"probability": "0.0357"}
