To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is provided.

First, let's define our terms:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

We also need some relevant figures:
- Number of computer science professors (\( CS \)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\( Hum \)): 75
- Total number of professors: \( 100 \)

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can infer that Jason’s description (creative, imaginative, not very technical) is more common among humanities professors. Therefore, let’s assume:

\[ P(D|Hum) > P(D|CS) \]

For simplicity, let’s assign some hypothetical probabilities based on Jason's description fitting more with humanities:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.05 \)
- \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.20 \)

The overall probability of the description \( P(D) \) is estimated by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.05 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.0125 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1625 \]

Now, substituting these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.1625} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.0125}{0.1625} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.077"} \]
