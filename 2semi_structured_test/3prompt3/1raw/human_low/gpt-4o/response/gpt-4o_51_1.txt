To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the terms:

- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(Hum)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \(P(D | CS)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \(P(D | Hum)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \(P(CS | D)\): The posterior probability that the professor is from computer science given the description.
- \(P(Hum | D)\): The posterior probability that the professor is from the humanities given the description.

Given the setup:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- So, \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) 
- \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Now, based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits that are less common in the field of computer science (e.g., not particularly technical) and more aligned with the humanities (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven).

Intuitively, we could say that \(P(D | CS)\) should be lower and \(P(D | Hum)\) should be higher, but let's assume reasonable estimations:
- Assume \(P(D | CS) = 0.1\) (a lower likelihood because Jason's description is less typical for computer science professors)
- Assume \(P(D | Hum) = 0.9\) (a higher likelihood because Jason's description is more typical for humanities professors)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description occurring, which can be calculated as:

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.036"}
