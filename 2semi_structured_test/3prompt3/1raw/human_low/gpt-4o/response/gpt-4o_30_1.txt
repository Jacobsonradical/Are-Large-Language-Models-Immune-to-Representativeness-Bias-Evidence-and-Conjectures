To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be simplified as follows:

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (Hum) = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

Bayes’ Theorem: 

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

Since we are given the description of Jason and need to determine whether he is a computer science professor based on his personality traits, we can reason that the description of "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" is more aligned with humanities professors than with computer science professors. 

The specific probabilities of the description fitting a professor from each field (\( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Hum) \)) are not given explicitly, but intuitively based on common stereotypes and expectations:

- \( P(Description | CS) \) is likely lower because the described traits are not typically associated with computer science professors.
- \( P(Description | Hum) \) is likely higher because the described traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors.

For the sake of calculation, let's make rough estimations:

- \( P(Description | CS) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(Description | Hum) \approx 0.8 \)

Using these estimations:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Applying Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
