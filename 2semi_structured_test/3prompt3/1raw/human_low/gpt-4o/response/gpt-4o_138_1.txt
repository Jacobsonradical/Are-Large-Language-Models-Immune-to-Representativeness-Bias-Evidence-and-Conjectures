To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Define the prior probabilities:**
   - The number of computer science professors, \(\text{P(A)}\), in the study is 25 out of 100.
     \[ \text{P(A)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - The number of humanities professors, \(\text{P(B)}\), in the study is 75 out of 100.
     \[ \text{P(B)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Estimate the likelihoods based on the description:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood that a description like Jason's would fit a computer science professor, \(\text{P(D|A)}\). Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might be less typical for the technical nature of computer science. We might estimate this to be relatively low. Let’s assume \(\text{P(D|A)} = 0.1\).
   - Similarly, we need to estimate the likelihood that a description like Jason’s would fit a humanities professor, \(\text{P(D|B)}\). Based on the description, it seems more aligned with the humanities. Let’s assume \(\text{P(D|B)} = 0.4\).

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   - We want to find \(\text{P(A|D)}\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
     \[ \text{P(A|D)} = \frac{\text{P(D|A)} \times \text{P(A)}}{\text{P(D|A)} \times \text{P(A)} + \text{P(D|B)} \times \text{P(B)}} \]

4. **Substitute the values:**
   \[ \text{P(A|D)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \]
   \[ \text{P(A|D)} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.3} \]
   \[ \text{P(A|D)} = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
   \[ \text{P(A|D)} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.077.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
