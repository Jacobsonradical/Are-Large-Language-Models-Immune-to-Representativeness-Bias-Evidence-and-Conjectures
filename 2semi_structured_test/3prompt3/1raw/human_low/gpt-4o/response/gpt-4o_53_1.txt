To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason's description.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \):**
   - We have 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(\neg A) \):**
   - The probability that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor).
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given the two groups.
   - Jason is described as emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, not particularly technical, and enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
   - These traits may be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.

4. **Posterior probability calculation:**
   - To estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) informally, let's assume:
     - \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood of description for a computer science professor): Suppose 0.1 (Jason's traits are less typical for computer science professors).
     - \( P(B|\neg A) \) (likelihood of description for a humanities professor): Suppose 0.9 (Jason's traits are more typical for humanities professors).

Using these assumptions and applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.036 \]
