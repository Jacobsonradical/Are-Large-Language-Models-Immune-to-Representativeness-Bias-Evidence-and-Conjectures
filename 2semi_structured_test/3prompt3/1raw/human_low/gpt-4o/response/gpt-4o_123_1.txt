Given the problem, we need to update our prior belief about Jason's profession based on the description provided. This involves applying Bayes' Theorem.

Initially, let's set up the problem's base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 (computer science professor)
- P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75 (humanities professor)

The description given doesn't sound particularly technical, which may suggest that Jason is less likely to be a computer science professor. We'll need to consider the likelihoods:
- P(Description | CS): The probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- P(Description | Hum): The probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.

Though exact numbers for these likelihoods are not provided, we can estimate them based on typical attributes related to both fields. Humanities professors are often more associated with creativity, emotional drive, and non-technical capabilities.

Assuming:
- P(Description | CS) = 0.1 (somewhat low probability because computer science professors are more likely to be technical)
- P(Description | Hum) = 0.4 (higher probability because humanities professors are more likely to fit this description)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.4 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors after considering the description is about 0.077 or 7.7%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
