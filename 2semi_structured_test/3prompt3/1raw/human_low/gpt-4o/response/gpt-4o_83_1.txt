To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem can be formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description (i.e., the overall probability of the description).

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability, \( P(A') \):**
   There are 75 humanities professors out of the 100 total professors.
   
   \[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):**
   From the description, Jason does not seem particularly technical and is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven - traits more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume the likelihood of randomly getting such a description for a computer science professor is lower than for a humanities professor. Suppose we estimate \( P(B|A) \) as 0.2.

4. **Complement Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \):**
   Jason's description fits the stereotypical profile of someone in the humanities. Therefore, we estimate this likelihood as relatively high, say 0.8.

5. **Marginal Likelihood, \( P(B) \):**
   This is the overall probability of getting such a description from any professor in the study. We compute this as:
   
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   
   Substituting the estimated values:
   
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
   
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
   
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.

The final answer in the prescribed format is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
