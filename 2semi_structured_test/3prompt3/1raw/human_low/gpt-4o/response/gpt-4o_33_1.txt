To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|X) \), where \( X \) represents being a humanities professor, can be inferred from the description.

While the description seems to align more with personality traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), Bayesian thinking involves considering the prior probabilities and how strongly the description changes those priors. Weâ€™ll need a reasonable way to assess these likelihoods given qualitative data. 

Since the description aligns more with humanities traits, let's assign some rough likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (since it's less likely this description matches a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|X) \approx 0.8 \) (since it's more likely this description matches a humanities professor).

Now, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|X)P(X) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
