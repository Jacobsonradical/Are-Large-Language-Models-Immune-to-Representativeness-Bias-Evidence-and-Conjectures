To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Breaking this down:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have quantitative measures for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we need to rely on the description. Jason's characteristics — creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical — are more stereotypically aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors.

So, let us assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.2 \] (a conservative estimate for computer science)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \] (a conservative estimate for humanities)

We also have:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
