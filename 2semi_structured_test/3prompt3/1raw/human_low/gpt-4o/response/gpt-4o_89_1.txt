To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his personality description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's personality description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's personality description overall.

Given:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|¬A) \) (where ¬A denotes that Jason is not a computer science professor, i.e., he is a humanities professor). 

Since Jason's description is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," such traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors, we can make a rough estimation:
- Assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low, say 0.1 (as creative and emotionally driven traits are less likely in computer science).
- Assume \( P(B|¬A) \) is relatively high, say 0.6 (as those traits are more likely in humanities).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.475 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his personality description is approximately 0.0526.
