We are given a prior distribution and a description that fits Jason, and we are asked to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's establish the prior probability, which simply reflects the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider how well Jason's personality description matches typical profiles of computer science professors versus humanities professors. For this purpose, let's denote the following probabilities:
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is in humanities.

Without exact statistics on these probabilities, we will rely on norms and intuitions:
- The description suggests traits like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which intuitively seem more aligned with humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

Now, let's make a rough estimation:
- Suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \): A small probability that the description matches a computer science professor.
- Suppose \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \): A high probability that the description matches a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- \( P(CS) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \)

Calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.0357"} \]
