To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update prior beliefs with new evidence.

Given:
- The total sample size is 100 professors (25 computer science, 75 humanities).
- The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and not particularly technical.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event corresponding to Jason's description.

We are interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to estimate:
1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D|CS) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

**1. Prior Probability \( P(CS) \):**
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

**2. Likelihood \( P(D|CS) \):**
Given the description, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor because his interests and traits (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical) align more with humanities. Suppose the likelihood is low, say around 0.2.

**3. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**4. Likelihood \( P(D|H) \):**
Given the description, it is more likely that Jason is a humanities professor. Suppose the likelihood is higher, say around 0.8.

**5. Overall Probability \( P(D) \):**
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.25)}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769, or about 7.7%.
