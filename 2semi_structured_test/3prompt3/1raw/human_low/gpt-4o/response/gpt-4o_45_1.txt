To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's outline the problem:

**Bayes' theorem formula**:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability we want to find, i.e., the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( n_{CS} = 25 \)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( n_{H} = 75 \)).
- The total number of professors is 100 (\( n_{Total} = 100 \)).

Therefore:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without specific information about the exact probabilities of the description given each type of professor (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \)), we typically rely on general intuition about the context. 

Jason's description seems to align more with traits commonly associated with humanities professors (e.g., creativity, imagination, emotional drive) rather than computer science professors (who might be seen as more technically focused).

Thus, though not quantified exactly, we might intuitively consider that the likelihood of a humanities professor having Jasonâ€™s description is higher than that of a computer science professor, represented as \( P(B|A^c) > P(B|A) \).

Let's define:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (a rough estimate reflecting Jason's traits not being highly representative of computer science professors).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \) (a rough estimate reflecting Jason's traits being more representative of humanities professors).

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.08" \]
