To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's denote the description as \( D \).

   We need to estimate:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) \): The probability of describing a computer science professor in the manner described.
   - \( P(D \mid Hum) \): The probability of describing a humanities professor in the manner described.

   Based on the given description of Jason:
   - "Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven": These traits are typically more associated with humanities than with computer science.
   - "Not particularly technical": This aligns more with humanities, as technical proficiency is a core aspect of computer science.

   Although we do not have exact numerical values for \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid Hum) \), we can qualitatively conclude that \( P(D \mid Hum) \) is likely higher than \( P(D \mid CS) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \).

Given the nature of the description, we assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.1 \) (low, since traits are less common for CS)
- \( P(D \mid Hum) \approx 0.9 \) (high, since traits are more common for humanities)

Substituting these into Bayes' formula:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.036.

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.036"}
```
