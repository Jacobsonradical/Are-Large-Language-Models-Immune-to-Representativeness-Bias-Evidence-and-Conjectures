To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C \mid E) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( E \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description \( E \), which can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

From the description provided, Jason seems to be more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, not particularly technical). Thus, if we assume:

- \( P(E \mid C) \) is relatively low
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is relatively high

Although exact probabilities for \( P(E \mid C) \) and \( P(E \mid H) \) are not provided, we can qualitatively assess the values based on the description alignment:

Let's assume for the sake of calculation:
- \( P(E \mid C) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood Jason is a computer science professor given his description)
- \( P(E \mid H) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood Jason is a humanities professor given his description)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: 0.036 \]

So the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
