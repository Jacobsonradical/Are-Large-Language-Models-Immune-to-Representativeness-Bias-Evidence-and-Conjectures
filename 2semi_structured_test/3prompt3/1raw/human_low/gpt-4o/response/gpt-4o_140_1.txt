To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one from the humanities, we use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.

   Thus, the prior probabilities are:
   - P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We need to evaluate the likelihood of observing Jason's description if he were a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 

Since Jason is described as "not particularly technical," "creative and imaginative," and is passionate about activities typically associated with the humanities, the description seems to better match common stereotypes of humanities professors over computer science professors.

Let’s assign rough likelihoods based on these interpretations:
   - P(Description | CS) ≈ 0.1 (Jason is less likely to be described this way if he's in computer science)
   - P(Description | Hum) ≈ 0.9 (Jason is more likely to fit this description if he's in the humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability (using Bayes' Theorem):**

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

Now compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
