To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(A)\))**:
   The prior probability is the probability that the professor is from computer science, which is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Probability of the Description (\(P(B)\))**:
   We need to consider that the description can apply to both computer science and humanities professors. Given that we don't have numerical details on how many in each category match the description, weâ€™ll assume that the descriptions are equally likely from either group because no additional information suggests otherwise.

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B | A) \))**:
   - If the description equally applies to computer scientists and humanists (a neutral assumption given the lack of specific likelihood data), then the likelihood \( P(B | A) \) is not explicitly given. 

Given the problem setup, we assume the descriptions were generated in a way that doesn't inherently bias one discipline over the other.

4. **Total Probability (\(P(B)\))**:
   This is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the description among both disciplines.
   \[ P(B) = P(B | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(B | \text{Humanities}) P(\text{Humanities}) \]
   \[ P(B) = P(B | \text{CS}) 0.25 + P(B | \text{Humanities}) 0.75 \]

Given no additional information about the different likelihoods between humanities and computer science descriptions, we can assume \( P(B | \text{CS}) \) roughly equals \( P(B | \text{Humanities}) \).

Therefore, Bayes' theorem simplifies because \( P(B | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(B | \text{Humanities}) \) cancel out:
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{(0.25 + 0.75)} = 0.25 \]

Thus the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \boxed{0.25} \]
