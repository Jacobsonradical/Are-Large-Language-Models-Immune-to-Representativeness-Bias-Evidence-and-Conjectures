To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. We start with the prior probabilities and then adjust based on the likelihood of the observed description given each category (computer science and humanities).

First, let's denote the prior probabilities:
- Let \( P(\text{CS}) \) be the prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- Let \( P(\text{Hum}) \) be the prior probability that a professor is from the humanities.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

So,
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description given each category:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|\text{Hum}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given the description of Jason being imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, and passionate, it seems more consistent with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

While numerical values for these likelihoods aren't provided, we'll use a heuristic approach. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|\text{Hum}) = 0.9 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})}{P(D)} \]

The total probability of the description (\( P(D) \)) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
