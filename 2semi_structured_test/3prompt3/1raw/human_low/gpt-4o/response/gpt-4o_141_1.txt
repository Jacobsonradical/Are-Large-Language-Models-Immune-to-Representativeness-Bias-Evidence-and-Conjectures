To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we employ Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities. We know there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) of being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability \( P(H) \) of being a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider how likely it is to get Jason's description if he were a computer science professor versus if he were a humanities professor. Based on Jason's description, he is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, but not particularly technical. These characteristics seem to align more with the typical profile of someone in the humanities rather than computer science.

Let’s denote the likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor by \( P(D|CS) \), and the likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor by \( P(D|H) \). Although precise numerical values for these likelihoods are not given, based on common stereotypes, it is reasonable to assume:

\[ P(D|CS) \ll P(D|H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(D|CS) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.9 \]

Bayes' Theorem then tells us:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the assumed values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Hence, the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.0357.

Therefore, your answer should be formatted as:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
