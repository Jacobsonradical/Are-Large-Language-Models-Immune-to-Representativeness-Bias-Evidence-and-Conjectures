To address the question, we use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the new evidence provided by Jason's description.

First, we need the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
\( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
\( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \) versus a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \). The description suggests traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a lack of technical focus, which are more likely associated with humanities professors.

Suppose we consider the probabilities of these descriptions as follows:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (relatively low, given that such descriptions are less common among computer science professors)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (relatively high, as these descriptions are more common in humanities)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Let's compute this step-by-step:

1. Calculating \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.7
\]

2. Calculating \( P(CS|D) \):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = 0.0357
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.0357\), or about 3.57%.

Therefore, the probability is:

\{"probability": "0.0357"\}
