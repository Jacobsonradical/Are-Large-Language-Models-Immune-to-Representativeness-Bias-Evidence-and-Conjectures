To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:

- Probability (Jason is a computer science professor) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability (Jason is a humanities professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description given each category. From the description, Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) seem to align more with common stereotypes associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

While it's challenging to quantify this without additional data on how traits correspond to the two groups, we can reasonably infer that this description is more likely typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

For simplicity in this context, let's assign a likelihood ratio based on this intuition:

- Likelihood (Description | Computer Science) = 0.2
- Likelihood (Description | Humanities) = 0.8

Now we use Bayes' theorem to update the posterior probability.

Posterior (Computer Science | Description) = [ P(Description | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science) ] / P(Description)

- P(Description | Computer Science) = 0.2
- P(Computer Science) = 0.25
- P(Description | Humanities) = 0.8
- P(Humanities) = 0.75

P(Description) = [P(Description | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science)] + [P(Description | Humanities) * P(Humanities)]

P(Description) = (0.2 * 0.25) + (0.8 * 0.75)
P(Description) = 0.05 + 0.6
P(Description) = 0.65

Thus,

Posterior (Computer Science | Description) = (0.2 * 0.25) / 0.65
Posterior (Computer Science | Description) = 0.05 / 0.65
Posterior (Computer Science | Description) â‰ˆ 0.0769

Thus, our posterior probability is approximately 0.077, or 7.7%.
