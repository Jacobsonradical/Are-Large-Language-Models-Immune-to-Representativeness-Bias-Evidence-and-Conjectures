To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \):
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(\text{humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\text{humanities}) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\text{humanities}) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason seems more aligned with typical traits of humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) rather than those typically associated with computer science professors (e.g., technical orientation). For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (low probability given he is in computer science).
- \( P(B|\text{humanities}) = 0.9 \) (high probability given he is in humanities).

Now, we can calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{humanities}) \cdot P(\text{humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
