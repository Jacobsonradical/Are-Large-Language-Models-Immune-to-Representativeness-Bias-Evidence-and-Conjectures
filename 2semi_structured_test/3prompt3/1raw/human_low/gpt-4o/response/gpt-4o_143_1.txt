To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, and in this case, will help us update our belief based on the description of Jason.

We need the following information:
- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D | CS)\): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

First, let's calculate the priors:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{number \, of \, computer \, science \, professors}{total \, number \, of \, professors} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{number \, of \, humanities \, professors}{total \, number \, of \, professors} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, but not particularly technical. This set of traits might be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.

- \(P(D | CS)\): This is likely to be relatively low since the description does not emphasize technical skills.
- \(P(D | H)\): This is likely to be relatively high since the description fits well with common stereotypes of humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's make rough estimates:
- \(P(D | CS) = 0.1\) (likelihood of such a descriptive match for a computer science professor)
- \(P(D | H) = 0.9\) (likelihood of such a descriptive match for a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)}\]
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75}\]
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675}\]
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}\]
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
