To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given personality description.

First, we need to establish the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Let's start identifying each of these probabilities step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**
   Assessing personality traits, adjectives like "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical" seem to align more with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Therefore,
   \[
   P(B|A) \text{ (Probability the description fits a CS professor)} \quad \text{may be relatively low}.
   \]
   For simplicity, assume:
   \[
   P(B|A) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(B|\neg A) \text{ (Probability the description fits a humanities professor)} \quad \text{may be relatively high}.
   \]
   Assume:
   \[
   P(B|\neg A) = 0.7
   \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**
   The Law of Total Probability tells us:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**
   Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.045
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.045"\}}
\]
