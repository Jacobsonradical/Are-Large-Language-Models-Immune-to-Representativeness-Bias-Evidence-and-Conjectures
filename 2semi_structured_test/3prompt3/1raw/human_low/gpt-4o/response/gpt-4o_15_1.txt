To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Let’s break down the problem step by step.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We must consider how likely it is that Jason’s description matches typical traits of professors in each field. Based on the description, Jason:
   - Is creative and imaginative
   - Is emotionally driven
   - Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
   - Is not particularly technical

   Generally, these traits might be more common in humanities professors. We'll assume some generalized likelihoods based on this description:

   - Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(description | CS)\)):
     Let’s estimate this might be lower, say around \(P(description | CS) = 0.1\).

   - Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(description | H)\)):
     This is likely higher, say around \(P(description | H) = 0.9\).

3. **Posterior probability** (using Bayes' Theorem):

   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   
   Where \(P(description)\) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
   
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | H) \times P(H)
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   P(description) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(description) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculate the posterior probability:

   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0357.
