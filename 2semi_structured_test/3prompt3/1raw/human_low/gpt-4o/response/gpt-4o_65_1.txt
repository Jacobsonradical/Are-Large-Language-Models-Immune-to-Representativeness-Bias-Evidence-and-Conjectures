To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS) given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities, \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \] (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science)
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \] (since 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities)

Next, consider the likelihoods, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the description, Jason appears to exhibit traits more commonly associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, but not particularly technical). Thus, heuristically, it seems more likely that Jason is a humanities professor.

Let's estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of a computer science professor having these traits might be lower, let's say around 0.1 (this is a subjective estimate based on the description leaning more towards humanities traits).
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of a humanities professor having these traits is presumably higher, let's say around 0.7 (again, a subjective estimate).

Now we can find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.7 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0455 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
