To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches.

First, let's identify the priors:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor. Given there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description matching if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description matching if he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description is more typical of someone in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical), we can assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is low, let’s assume a value like 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher, let’s assume a value like 0.5.

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of Jason's description. Using the law of total probability, we get:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.0625"}
