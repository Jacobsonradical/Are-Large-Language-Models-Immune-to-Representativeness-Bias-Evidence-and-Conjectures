To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote the events:
- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \) : The description of Jason

We know from the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not very technical):
- This description seems more aligned with typical humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \) (since the description doesn't strongly fit a typical computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \) (since the description strongly fits a typical humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
