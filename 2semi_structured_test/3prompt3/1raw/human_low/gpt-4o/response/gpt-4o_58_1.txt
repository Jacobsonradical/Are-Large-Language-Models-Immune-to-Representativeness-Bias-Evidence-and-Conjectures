Let's start by considering the prior probabilities. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods. The description of Jason includes traits such as being creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, being gifted and passionate but not particularly technical. These traits seem more stereotypically aligned with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the event that Jason has the given description.
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) as the probability that a computer science professor has the given description.
- \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) as the probability that a humanities professor has the given description.

Based on the description, we might reasonably assess that:
\[ P(D|\text{CS}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.9 \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
