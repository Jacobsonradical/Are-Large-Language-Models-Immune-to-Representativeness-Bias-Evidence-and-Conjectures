To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc \mid CS) \): The likelihood of observing Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc \mid H) \): The likelihood of observing Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \): The overall probability of observing Jason's description.

**Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{P(Desc \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

First, we need the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's make intuitive estimates of the likelihoods:
Given Jason's description, it seems to lean towards traits more commonly associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical). We can reasonably assume:
\[ P(Desc \mid CS) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(Desc \mid H) \approx 0.9 \]

Using these estimates, we can find \( P(Desc) \):

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{P(Desc \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Desc) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description is approximately:
