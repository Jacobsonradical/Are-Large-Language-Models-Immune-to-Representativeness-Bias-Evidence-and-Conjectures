To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the prior probability of an event to the likelihood of the event given new evidence.

First, some definitions and given numbers:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of Jason's description.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\( N_{CS} \)) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (\( N_{Hum} \)) = 75

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, using the description, let's make some reasonable assumptions:

Given the description of Jason as someone who is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical," it seems less likely that he is a computer science professor and more likely that he is a humanities professor. We need to set some assumed probabilities for simplicity:

- Assuming \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood of such traits in a computer science professor given the stereotype)
- Assuming \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.6 \) (higher likelihood of such traits in a humanities professor given the stereotype)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in our numbers:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.6 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0526.

In the requested format:
\[ {"probability": "0.0526"} \]
