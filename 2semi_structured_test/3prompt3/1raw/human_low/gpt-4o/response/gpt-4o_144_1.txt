To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

The given priors are:
- Number of computer science professors (\(P(CS)\)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\(P(Hum)\)): 75
- Total professors: 100

Given these priors, the initial (prior) probabilities that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor are:
\(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
\(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need to estimate how likely a given professor (computer science or humanities) fits Jason's description. Let's denote the probability of the description given the professor's field of expertise as follows:
- \(P(Desc | CS)\): Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason’s description
- \(P(Desc | Hum)\): Probability that a humanities professor matches Jason’s description

Since no specific data or detailed breakdown of these probabilities is provided, it is reasonable to assume a higher probability of fitting Jason's description as a humanities professor, based on the description which emphasizes creativity, imagination, and lack of technicality. This assumption is qualitative, so for calculations, let's assume:

\(P(Desc | CS) = 0.1\) (lower due to the description being less typical for computer science)
\(P(Desc | Hum) = 0.9\) (higher due to the description being more typical for humanities)

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]
\[
P(Desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(Desc) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now calculate \(P(CS | Desc)\):
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0357.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
