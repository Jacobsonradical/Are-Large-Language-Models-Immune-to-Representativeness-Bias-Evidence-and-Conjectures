To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process summarized:

1. **Prior probabilities (base rates)**:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 25/100 = 0.25.
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75/100 = 0.75.

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to consider how likely this description fits a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description suggests a person who is:
   - Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven
   - Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
   - Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical

   Generally, these traits might be more common in humanities professors compared to computer science professors, who might tend to be more technically focused.

   Let's denote:
   - P(description | CS) as the likelihood of a computer science professor having this description.
   - P(description | H) as the likelihood of a humanities professor having this description.

   For argument's sake, let's assume:
   - P(description | CS) = 0.1 (purely illustrative and based on assumed lower likelihood due to less emphasis on technicality)
   - P(description | H) = 0.9 (purely illustrative and based on assumed higher likelihood due to creativity and emotional drive)

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem**:
   ```
   P(CS | description) = [P(description | CS) * P(CS)] / [P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | H) * P(H)]
   ```
   Plugging in the numbers:
   ```
   P(CS | description) = [0.1 * 0.25] / [0.1 * 0.25 + 0.9 * 0.75]
                       = 0.025 / (0.025 + 0.675)
                       = 0.025 / 0.7
                       = 0.0357 (approximately)
   ```

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
```json
{"probability": "0.036"}
```
