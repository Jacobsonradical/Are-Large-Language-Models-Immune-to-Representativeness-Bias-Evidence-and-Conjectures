To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his personality description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine these probabilities:

1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of \( D \) occurring.

Given the sample sizes, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we have to make reasonable assumptions based on the provided description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits seem to be more aligned with the humanities than with computer science. Therefore, we can infer that:

\[ P(D|C) \) is likely low (let's assume a reasonable estimate, e.g., 0.1). \]
\[ P(D|H) \) is likely higher (let's assume a reasonable estimate, e.g., 0.7). \]

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0455 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
