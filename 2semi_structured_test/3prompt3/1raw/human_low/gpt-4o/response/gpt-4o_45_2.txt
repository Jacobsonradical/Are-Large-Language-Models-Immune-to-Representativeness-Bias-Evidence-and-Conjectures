To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- \( P(A) \): Probability Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Probability Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|A) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we're equally likely to pick any description from the 100, our prior beliefs are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given Jason’s description is more associated with traits often found in humanities professors, we can hypothesize:
- \( P(D|A) \): A lower probability estimate, because "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical" are traits less typical for computer science, let’s assume 0.1.
- \( P(D|B) \): A higher probability estimate, let's assume 0.9.

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
