Given the provided description and the sample sizes of professors, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, we need to identify and use the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): 
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): 
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \))
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \))

Given the description, it seems more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). However, we don't have exact numbers for these likelihoods. For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{(less likely for a CS professor)}
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(more likely for a humanities professor)}
   \]

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem:**
Bayes' theorem formula:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.

\[
{"probability": "0.077"}
\]
