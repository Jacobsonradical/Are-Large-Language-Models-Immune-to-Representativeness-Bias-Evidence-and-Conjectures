To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define our terms:

- \(P(CS)\): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D \mid CS)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D \mid H)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): Overall probability of the description.

We need to find \(P(CS \mid D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]

Here:
- \(P(CS)\) = 25/100 = 0.25 (because there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors)
- \(P(H)\) = 75/100 = 0.75 (because there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors)
- Since we have no specific likelihoods provided, we assume \(P(D \mid CS)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\) based on the description's fit:

Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical") seems more aligned with typical characteristics associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Assuming we subjectively estimate based on typical profiles:
Let's assume:
- \(P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(D \mid H) \approx 0.9\)

Next, calculate \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:
\[P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)\]
\[P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675\]
\[P(D) = 0.7\]

Now, calculate \(P(CS \mid D)\):
\[P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7}\]
\[P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}\]
\[P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.0357\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
