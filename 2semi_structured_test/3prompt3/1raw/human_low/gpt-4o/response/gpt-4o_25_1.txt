To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to take into account the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability of a professor being from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of a professor being from humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science (\( P(D | CS) \)) and given that the professor is from the humanities (\( P(D | Hum) \)).
   - Based on the description provided (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not particularly technical), it seems more consistent with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

   We can subjectively estimate:
   - \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood since the description doesn't align well with the typical traits of computer science professors).
   - \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood since the description aligns well with the typical traits of humanities professors).

3. **Posterior Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
   
   Bayes' theorem formula:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Plugging in the estimated values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, we calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
