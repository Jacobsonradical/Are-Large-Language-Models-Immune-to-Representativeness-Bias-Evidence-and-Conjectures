To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) is the description given of Jason.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability ( \( P(A) \) )**:
   We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability ( \( P(A') \) )**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood ( \( P(B|A) \) )**:
   This is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason seems more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, exploring). Therefore, \( P(B|A) \) might be relatively low. Let’s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \).

4. **Complementary Likelihood ( \( P(B|A') \) )**:
   This is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Since the description fits closely with common traits of humanities professors, let’s assume \( P(B|A') = 0.9 \).

5. **Total Probability of Description ( \( P(B) \) )**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357. In the required format:
