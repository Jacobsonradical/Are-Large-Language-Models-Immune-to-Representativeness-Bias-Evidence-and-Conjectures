Based on the given description of Jason, certain personality traits and interests (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate but not particularly technical) appear to align more closely with the stereotypical attributes of professors in the humanities rather than those typically associated with computer science professors. However, to determine the posterior probability, we must consider both the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood informed by the description provided.

1. Base rates (prior probabilities):
   - Probability of choosing a computer science professor (Pc): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of choosing a humanities professor (Ph): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Likelihoods (conditional probabilities given the description):
   - Given the description, it seems more likely (though subjective to some degree) that Jason is in the humanities.

Let's quantify this subjectively:
   - Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\( P(D|C) \)): Let's assign it a lower probability, say \( 0.2 \).
   - Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)): Let’s assign it a higher probability, say \( 0.8 \).

Using Bayes’ Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) (the overall probability of the description) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.05) + (0.6) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
