To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(H)):** The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
   \[
   P(\text{H}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(D|CS) and P(D|H)):**
   We need to estimate the likelihood of having the description provided (D) given that Jason is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)) and given that Jason is a humanities professor (P(D|H)).
   
   Given the description of Jason being emotionally driven, creative, imaginative and not particularly technical, it seems more consistent with the stereotypes of humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:
   \[
   P(D|\text{H}) \gg P(D|\text{CS})
   \]
   
   Let's suppose \(P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.1\) and \(P(D|\text{H}) = 0.9\) in line with these stereotypes (these are hypothetical values for the sake of calculation).

4. **Posterior Probability using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}
   \]
   
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75}
   \]
   
   Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]
   
   Finally:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036. 

Therefore, my answer is as follows:
```json
{"probability": "0.036"}
