To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant steps:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Assess the likelihood of Jason's description given each group:
   - Let \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{H}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Considering Jason's description, he seems to exhibit traits more commonly associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical).

For simplification, let's assign arbitrary but reasonable estimates to these likelihoods:
   - \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{H}) \approx 0.8 \)

3. Calculate the total probability of Jason's description, \(P(\text{Desc})\):
   \[
   P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) 
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Desc}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Desc}) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

4. Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.
