To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, begin by using Bayes' Theorem. We need to weigh both the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, and the likelihood that a professor with Jason's traits would fall into each category.

The base rates from the study are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

This gives prior probabilities of:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (for computer science)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (for humanities)

Given the description of Jason, we need to determine how likely it is that a professor with his traits is from either category. 

Assume:
- \( P(traits|CS) \) - Likelihood of Jason's traits among computer science professors
- \( P(traits|Hum) \) - Likelihood of Jason's traits among humanities professors

Since specific likelihood values for a given personality profile are not provided, we perform an intuitive assessment based on the description provided:
- Descriptions of creativity, imagination, and emotional drives are potentially more aligned with humanities than the technical field of computer science.

Hypothetically estimating likelihoods:
- \( P(traits|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(traits|Hum) = 0.8 \)

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|traits) = \frac{P(traits|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(traits)}
\]

Note that \( P(traits) \) is a normalizing constant calculated as:

\[
P(traits) = P(traits|CS) \times P(CS) + P(traits|Hum) \times P(Hum) 
\]

\[
P(traits) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Finally:

\[
P(CS|traits) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
