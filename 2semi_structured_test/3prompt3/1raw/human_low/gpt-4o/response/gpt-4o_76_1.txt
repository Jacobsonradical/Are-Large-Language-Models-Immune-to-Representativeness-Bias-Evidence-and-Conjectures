To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A_1 \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_2 \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided for Jason.

We are given:
- \( P(A_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D | A_1) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | A_2) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate but not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Therefore, we can reasonably estimate:
- \( P(D | A_1) \) to be lower (let’s assume \( 0.1 \) as humanities professors are more likely to have these traits).
- \( P(D | A_2) \) to be higher (let’s assume \( 0.9 \) for the same reason).

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1 | D) = \frac{P(D | A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(D | A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now calculate \( P(A_1 | D) \):
\[ P(A_1 | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_1 | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_1 | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
\[ P(A_1 | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the probability is:
