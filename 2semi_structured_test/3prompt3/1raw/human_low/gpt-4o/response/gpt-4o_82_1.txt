To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to conduct a Bayesian update, starting with the prior probabilities based on the initial sample sizes and adjusting them with the likelihood of Jason's description fitting the profiles for each group.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   To update these priors, we need the likelihoods that a computer science professor and a humanities professor would match Jason's description. Generally, the described traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical) are more characteristic of humanities professors. We can assign arbitrary but reasonable values based on this assumption:
   - Probability that Jason’s description matches the profile of a computer science professor (\(P(Desc | CS)\)): Let's say it is \(0.1\).
   - Probability that Jason’s description matches the profile of a humanities professor (\(P(Desc | Hum)\)): Let’s say it is \(0.8\).

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   We use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   
   Where the overall probability of the description is:
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   
   So, calculating \(P(Desc)\):
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625
   \]

   Now, the posterior probability is:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{\ "probability": "0.04" }
