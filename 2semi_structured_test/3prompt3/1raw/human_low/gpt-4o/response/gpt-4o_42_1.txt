To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

The prior probability (\(P(CS)\)) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability (\(P(H)\)) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Let \( D \) be the event that the description matches Jason's profile. We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To compute \( P(CS|D) \), we need \( P(D|CS) \), \( P(D|H) \), and \( P(D) \). 

Since we don't have the exact distributions \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), let's use reasonable assumptions based on the description. Jason's description suggests he is more aligned with characteristics typical of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotional, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical) rather than a computer science professor.

Assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \): There's a relatively small chance that a computer science professor fits this description.
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.3 \): There's a higher chance that a humanities professor fits this description.

Now, the total probability of the description \( P(D) \) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.1 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
