To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(H)\): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Assess how well the personality description fits each group:** 
   Jason’s description emphasizes creativity, emotional drive, reading, and exploring, which might more likely be associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. But we need to assign probabilities for these fits:
   - Probability of the given description given Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(D|CS)\): let's estimate this as low, say 0.2.
   - Probability of the given description given Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(D|H)\): let's estimate this as high, say 0.8.

3. **Calculate the evidence, \(P(D)\):**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes’ theorem to find the requested posterior probability:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is about 0.0769. 

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
