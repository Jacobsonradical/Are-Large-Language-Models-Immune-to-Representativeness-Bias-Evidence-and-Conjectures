To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we should consider both prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description for both groups (computer science professors and humanities professors). 

First, let’s consider the base rates or priors for each group:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
Therefore, the probability of randomly picking a computer science professor, \(P(\text{CS})\), is 0.25 and the probability of picking a humanities professor, \(P(\text{Hum})\), is 0.75.

Next, we evaluate how typical this description is for professors in each field. Based on the description, Jason seems more in line with traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, not particularly technical) that could be stereotypically more common among humanities professors rather than computer science professors who might be more inclined towards technical attributes.

Let’s denote:
- \(P(D|\text{CS})\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \(P(D|\text{Hum})\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

Given the competitive advantage of the description leaning towards humanities traits, let's assume:
- \(P(D|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(D|\text{Hum}) \approx 0.8\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{5}{65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
