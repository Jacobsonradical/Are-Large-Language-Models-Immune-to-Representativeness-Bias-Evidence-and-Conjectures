To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this formula:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of getting Jason's description.

Let's break it down:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(A) \) (prior that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) (prior that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

For \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description given the two groups. Since we don't have exact data, let's make some reasoned estimates based on the provided description:
- Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical."
- This description might align more with the traits typically associated with humanities than computer science.

While these traits could be present in a computer scientist, they are generally more common and emphasized in humanities fields. Hence, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor, is relatively low, say 0.2.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of the description if he is a humanities professor, is relatively high, say 0.8.

Now using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{13} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on this description is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.0769"}} \]
