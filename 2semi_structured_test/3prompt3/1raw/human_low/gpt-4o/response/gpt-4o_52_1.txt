Let's start by determining the base rate probability (i.e., the prior probability) of selecting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor from the sample.

In the study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

So, the prior probability of picking a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability of picking a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the given description of Jason and how likely it is to match a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. 

These traits seem more stereotypically aligned with humanities than with computer science, although there are certainly creative and imaginative individuals in computer science as well. However, since "not particularly technical" stands out, it further suggests humanities over computer science.

To formalize this, let's denote:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \) as the probability of this description given Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) as the probability of this description given Jason is a humanities professor

Since the description seems to align more closely with humanities professors, we might hypothesize:

\[ P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.8 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description. This can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.65 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus:

\[ \text{Posterior probability} = 0.077 \]

So the response in the requested format is:

```json
{"probability": "0.077"}
