To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the description that was given.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem gives us this formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

1. **\( P(A) \)**: Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
   Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **\( P(B|A) \)**: Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   Here, we analyze the description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, passionate but not particularly technical. These traits are more stereotypically aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors. So, we might assign a lower probability to this description fitting a computer science professor, let's estimate it as \( 0.2 \).

3. **\( P(\neg A) \)**: Probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

4. **\( P(B|\neg A) \)**: Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
   Jason's traits align well with typical traits expected in the humanities. We might assign a higher probability, say \( 0.8 \).

5. **\( P(B) \)**: Total probability of the description.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Using these values in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.0769"}
