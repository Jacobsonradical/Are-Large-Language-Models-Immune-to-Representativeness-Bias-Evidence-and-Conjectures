To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we start with the base rates and use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Base Rates:**
   - Number of computer science professors = 25
   - Number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 100

   Hence, P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 and P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We have to determine how likely Jason's profile fits with being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical."

   Typically, these traits might be considered more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors, given the general stereotypes of these fields.

   Let's assume:
   - P(Description | CS) = Likelihood that a computer science professor fits this description.
   - P(Description | Hum) = Likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description.

   Although we don’t have exact values, based on the description:
   - P(Description | Hum) is likely higher than P(Description | CS).

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   We use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs: 

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Where \(P(Description)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)
   \]

   Since we’re focusing on relative likelihoods without exact values, and knowing that the description fits better with humanities, we recognize P(Description | Hum) > P(Description | CS).

   Therefore, \(P(CS | Description)\) is going to be smaller than the prior probability, P(CS) = 0.25.

Given the description fits more with the humanities and stereotypes associated:

\[
\text{Conservatively, let's take an example relative likelihood comparison:} \\
P(Description | CS) = 0.1 \quad \text{(unlikely)}, \quad P(Description | Hum) = 0.9 \quad \text{(more likely)}
\]

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{(0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036
\]

This gives approximately:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.04"}
\]
