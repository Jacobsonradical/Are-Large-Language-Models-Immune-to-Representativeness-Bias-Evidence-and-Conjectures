To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Firstly, we need to determine:
1. The prior probability of selecting a professor from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) and the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) and a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)). Based on the description that Jason is not particularly technical but is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor. 

Let's assign subjective values to these likelihoods:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.1 \] (small because Jason’s traits are not typical of a computer science professor)
\[ P(D|Hum) = 0.9 \] (high because Jason’s traits are typical of a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS|D)\)) is calculated as follows:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plug in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.
