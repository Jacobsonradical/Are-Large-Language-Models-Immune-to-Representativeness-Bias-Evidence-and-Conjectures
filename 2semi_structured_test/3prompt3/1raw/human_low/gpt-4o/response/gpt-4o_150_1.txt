Firstly, let's use Bayes' Theorem for this problem. We need to determine the probability \(P(CS|D)\), where \(CS\) denotes that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(D\) is the given description.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(CS)\)**:
The probability \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, we have:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
The probability \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100, we have:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\)**:
From the description, Jason is emotionally driven, creative, and not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more closely with what might be stereotypically associated with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, a precise likelihood would ideally come from detailed statistical data observed in the study, which isn't provided here. 

In the absence of precise data, we can make a reasoned estimate:
- Let's estimate that the likelihood of a description like Jason's (emotionally driven, creative, not particularly technical) being a computer science professor is relatively low, say \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\).
- Similarly, let's estimate that the likelihood of such a description for a humanities professor is relatively higher, say \(P(D|H) = 0.7\).

4. **Total Probability \(P(D)\)**:
The total probability \(P(D)\) is the weighted average of the likelihoods over all professors:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

5. **Posterior Probability \(P(CS|D)\)**:
Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.045 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is approximately 0.045.

Therefore, the answer is:
