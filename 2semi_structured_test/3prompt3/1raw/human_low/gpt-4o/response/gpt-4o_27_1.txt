To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step method to solve it:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The prior probability \(P(\text{Humanities})\) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Determine the likelihood of the description given the professorâ€™s field:**
   - Let's denote the event "Jason's description" by \(D\).
   - We need to estimate \(P(D|\text{CS})\) and \(P(D|\text{Humanities})\), i.e., the probability of Jason's description given he is a CS professor or a Humanities professor.

Given the description, it contains features such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying travel, reading, exploring, and not being particularly technical. Such traits are more commonly associated with humanities than with computer science.

- While it's not strictly quantifiable without more data, we can assume:
  - \(P(D|\text{CS})\) (likelihood of the description if Jason is a CS professor) is relatively low. Let's assume \(P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.1\).
  - \(P(D|\text{Humanities})\) (likelihood of the description if Jason is a Humanities professor) is relatively high. Let's assume \(P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 0.9\).

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}{P(D)}
   \]

   To find \(P(D)\), we use the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities})\cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculate \(P(\text{CS}|D)\):
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

   Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
