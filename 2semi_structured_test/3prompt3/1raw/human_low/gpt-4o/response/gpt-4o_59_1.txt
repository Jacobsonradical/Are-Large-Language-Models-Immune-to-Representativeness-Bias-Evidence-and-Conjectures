To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is used to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. Below is the step-by-step process we will follow to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

1. Define the relevant probabilities:
   - Let \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

2. Priors \(P(CS)\) and \(P(H)\):
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - And, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. Likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\):
   - Since Jason's description suggests he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical", it seems to align more closely with humanities traits rather than computer science traits.
   - Let's assume that the likelihood of a humanities professor fitting this description is much higher than for a computer science professor. For illustration, assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \).

4. Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of observing the description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]
   Substituting our values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

5. Compute the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077, or 7.7%.

Here's the final answer in the requested format:
