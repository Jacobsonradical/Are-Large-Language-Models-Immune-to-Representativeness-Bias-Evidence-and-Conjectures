To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   Let's denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( A_{\text{CS}} \) and the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( A_{\text{H}} \).

   \[
   P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(A_{\text{H}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   This is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \((P(D | A_{\text{CS}}))\) or a humanities professor \((P(D | A_{\text{H}}))\). Jason's description shows traits that seem more aligned with a humanities professor (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). We'll make an educated estimate:
   
   - \( P(D | A_{\text{CS}}) \): Let's estimate this to be relatively low, say 0.2.
   - \( P(D | A_{\text{H}}) \): Let's estimate this to be relatively high, say 0.8.
   
3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(A_{\text{CS}} | D) = \frac{P(D | A_{\text{CS}}) \times P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(D)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability of the Description (Normalizing Factor):**

   \[
   P(D) = P(D | A_{\text{CS}}) \times P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(D | A_{\text{H}}) \times P(A_{\text{H}})
   \]
   
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

5. **Calculating the Posterior Probability:**

   \[
   P(A_{\text{CS}} | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.077"}}
\]
