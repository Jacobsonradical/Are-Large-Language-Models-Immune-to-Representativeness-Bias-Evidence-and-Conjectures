To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We need to assess how likely Jason's personality description would fit within each group.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) be the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) be the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) be the overall probability of Jason's description.

From the information given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since the information about how probable Jasonâ€™s description fits within each discipline was not given explicitly, we will have to make an assumption based on the description provided. Jason's description suggests traits such as creativity, a preference for emotional expression, and a lack of technical inclination, which generally align more with humanities than computer science.

Assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively low (e.g., 0.1) because Jason's description doesn't fit the typical profile of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively high (e.g., 0.9) because Jason's description fits well with the typical profile of a humanities professor.

First, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\( \boxed{P(CS | D) \approx 0.036} \)

Thus, the probability in proper format is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
