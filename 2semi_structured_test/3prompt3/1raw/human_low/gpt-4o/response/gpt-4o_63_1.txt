To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the process step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability**: We start with the prior probabilities of Jason being in each group:
   - The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (P(CS)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors (P(H)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood**: Next, we need to determine the likelihood, which is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he belongs to each group. Since we're not given specific probabilities for Jason's traits in each group, we'll need to make an educated guess based on common stereotypes and the given description.
   - The likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) might be considered lower because Jason is described as not particularly technical and more creatively inclined.
   - The likelihood of Jason being a humanities professor (P(Description | H)) might be considered higher because his traits align more with stereotypes of humanities professors who are often perceived as more creatively and emotionally driven.

3. **Posterior Probability**: Bayes' Theorem tells us that the posterior probability is proportional to the likelihood times the prior:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   However, since Jason's description is the same regardless of his group, we can simplify to comparing the relative likelihoods and priors:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)
   \]
   \[
   P(H | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Given educated guesses:
   - Assume \(P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.2\) (low because Jason is not technical),
   - Assume \(P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.8\) (high because Jason's traits are more aligned with the humanities).

4. Now, normalize to find the posterior probabilities:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
