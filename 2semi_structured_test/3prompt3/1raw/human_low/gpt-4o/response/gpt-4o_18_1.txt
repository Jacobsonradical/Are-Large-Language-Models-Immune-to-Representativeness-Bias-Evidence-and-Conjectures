To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**: The initial probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(Humanities))**: The initial probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(Humanities) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(Description|CS))**: The probability of the given description being one of a computer science professor. Based on the description, phrases like "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" do not typically align with stereotypes of computer science professors who might generally be considered more technical. Let's assume that P(Description|CS) is low, say 0.1.

4. **Likelihood (P(Description|Humanities))**: The probability of the given description being one of a humanities professor. The description aligns well with the stereotypes of humanities professors. Let's assume that P(Description|Humanities) is high, say 0.9.

5. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(CS|Description).
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

6. **Total Probability of Description (P(Description))**: This can be computed as:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|Humanities) \times P(Humanities)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

7. **Calculating Posterior Probability**:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.036"
\]
\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.036"}}
\]
