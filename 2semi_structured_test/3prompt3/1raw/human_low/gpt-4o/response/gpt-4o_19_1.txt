To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of our approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor out of the 100 professors (P(CS)) is 25/100 = 0.25.
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor out of the 100 professors (P(Hum)) is 75/100 = 0.75.

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description if he were a computer science professor (P(D|CS)).
   - We also need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description if he were a humanities professor (P(D|Hum)).

Given Jason's description:
- He is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven.
- Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
- Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.

Based on common stereotypes:
- **For humanities professors:** These traits seem more in line with personality traits often associated with humanities, which include creativity, passion, and less emphasis on technical skills.
- **For computer science professors:** Computer scientists might tend to be more technical and perhaps less focused on the creative, emotionally driven aspects in a professional context (though these traits can certainly be present, they might be less emphasized).

With this in mind, we might reasonably assume that P(D|Hum) > P(D|CS).

Since we do not have exact values for P(D|CS) and P(D|Hum), we will assume P(D|CS) is relatively lower than P(D|Hum). For concreteness, we'll assume:
- P(D|CS) = 0.1
- P(D|Hum) = 0.9

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where P(D) is the total probability of the description, which can be computed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the given description, is approximately 0.0357.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
