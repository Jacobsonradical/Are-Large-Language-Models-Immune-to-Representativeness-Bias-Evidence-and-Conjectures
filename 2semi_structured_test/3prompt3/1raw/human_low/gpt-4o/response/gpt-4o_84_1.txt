In order to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the given description.

First, let's define the components:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**: This is the initial probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability, \( P(A') \)**: Probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
   \[ P(A') = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**: Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Since we don't have specific information, we have to rely on typical assumptions:
   - Assume that computer science professors might be less likely to fit this "creative and imaginative" profile. Let's estimate this probability to be lower, say \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \).

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \)**: Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Humanities professors are often associated with being creative and imaginative:
   - Let's estimate this probability to be higher, say \( P(B|A') = 0.8 \).

5. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \)**: This is the probability of observing the description, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.077.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.077"}
