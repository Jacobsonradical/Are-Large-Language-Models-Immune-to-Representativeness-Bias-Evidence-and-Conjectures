Given the description of Jason, let's formally evaluate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

To do this, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We want to find:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) \]
where \(\text{CS}\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(D\) is the description provided.

1. **Prior probability:** 
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods:** 
   Based on the description, Jason appears to fit the stereotype of a humanities professor more than a computer science professor. Let's denote:

   \[ P(D \mid \text{CS}) \]
   \[ P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) \]

   Without specific information, we assume a humanities professor fits this description better than a computer science professor. So, we might hypothesize:

   \[ P(D \mid \text{CS}) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Normalization constant:**
   \[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) P(\text{Humanities}) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus:

{"probability": "0.077"}
