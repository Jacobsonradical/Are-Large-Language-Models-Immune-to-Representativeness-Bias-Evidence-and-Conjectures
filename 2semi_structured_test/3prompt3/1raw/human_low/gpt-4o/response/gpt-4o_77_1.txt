To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an individual is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the description if the individual is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the description.

First, let's identify the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- \( P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS professor}) \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities professor}) \)

Based on Jason's description, he seems to fit the profile of a humanities professor after considering traits like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, and not particularly technical. This fits more closely with typical humanities professor stereotypes than those of computer science professors. 

However, let's assign some probabilities to these likelihoods. Suppose:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS professor}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities professor}) = 0.9 \)

Total probability of observing the description (\( P(B) \)):
\[ P(B) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities professor}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS professor} |\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor} |\text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor} |\text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor} |\text{Description}) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability is approximately 0.036.
