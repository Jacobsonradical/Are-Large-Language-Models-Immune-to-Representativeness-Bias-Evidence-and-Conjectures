To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the terms for Bayes' Theorem in this context:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): Probability of the description given a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \): Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(Hum|D) \): Posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

From the problem statement:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) based on the description provided for Jason. From the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which may seem to fit less with the stereotypical traits of computer science professors and more with those of humanities professors.

For simplicity's sake, let's assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (reasonable guess given the description seems less fitting for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|Hum) = 0.8 \) (reasonable guess given the description seems more fitting for a humanities professor)

Now, let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{5}{65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{13} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0769.
