Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate but not particularly technical, we need to assess the likelihood that he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 

We start by determining the prior odds based on the sample sizes: 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The next step is to incorporate the description provided, which fits more closely with typical humanities traits rather than those of computer science, especially noting that Jason is "not particularly technical."

Given this description, we can reasonably assume the likelihood (the likelihood ratio) of this description being of a humanities professor is higher than it being of a computer science professor. Although exact numbers for these likelihoods are not given, it is reasonable to assume based on stereotypical descriptions that humanities professors are more likely to share the described traits compared to computer science professors.

Let's assume this likelihood ratio is in favor of the humanities professors. Let's denote the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor as \( L(\text{description}|\text{H}) \) and the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor as \( L(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \).

Since we only have prior probabilities and strong qualitative indications, we can multiply the priors by an estimated likelihood ratio that favors humanities traits significantly over computer science traits.

Assume a conservative likelihood ratio of 1:2 in favor of humanities professors. This is because the description vastly fits the stereotype of a humanities professor.

Now updating our probabilities:

\[ \text{Posterior probability (CS)} = \frac{P(\text{CS}) \cdot L(\text{description}|\text{CS})}{ P(\text{CS}) \cdot L(\text{description}|\text{CS}) + P(\text{H}) \cdot L(\text{description}|\text{H}) } \]

Given our prior probabilities and the assumed likelihood ratio:
\[ L(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = 1 \]
\[ L(\text{description}|\text{H}) = 2 \]

So:
\[ \text{Posterior probability (CS)} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 1}{0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot 2} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 1.5} = \frac{0.25}{1.75} \approx 0.143 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.143.

The final answer is structured as requested:

{"probability": "0.143"}
