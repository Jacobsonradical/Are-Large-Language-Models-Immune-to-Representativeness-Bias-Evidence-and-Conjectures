To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need the following probabilities:

1. **Prior probability**: The proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
2. **Likelihoods**: The probability of observing Jason's description given he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Given:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability is:
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate the likelihoods:

- Given Jason's description, which emphasizes creativity, imagination, and a lack of technical inclination, it seems more aligned with the traits typically associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Let's assume the probabilities for the sake of calculation:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.7 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Therefore:

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.7 \times 0.75) = (0.025) + (0.525) = 0.55 \]

Now we can compute:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.045 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description is approximately 0.045.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.045"}
