To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information given:

- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a professor from each field. Based on the description provided:

- Jason is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. 

These traits are generally more associated with the humanities but not exclusive.

Let's denote:
- P(description|CS) = Probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor.
- P(description|H) = Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description aligns more closely with traits often associated with humanities professors, we can reasonably assume:
- P(description|CS) = 0.2 (low probability)
- P(description|H) = 0.8 (high probability)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

To find P(description), the total probability of the description, we use:

\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.65 \]

Now, Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:
