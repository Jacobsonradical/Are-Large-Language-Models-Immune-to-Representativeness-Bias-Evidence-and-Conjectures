Given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

We need to find \( P(C | \text{Jason's description}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

To find \( P(\text{Jason's description}) \), we recognize that it is the sum of the probabilities of the description given each group, weighted by the prior probabilities of each group:
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = P(\text{Jason's description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we estimate \( P(\text{Jason's description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \).

From the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, but not technical.
These traits appear to more closely align with typical humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Jason's description} | C) = 0.1 \) (low, since Jason is not particularly technical)
- \( P(\text{Jason's description} | H) = 0.9 \) (high, since Jason's traits fit well with humanities)

Now, calculating the denominator:
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{Jason's description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
