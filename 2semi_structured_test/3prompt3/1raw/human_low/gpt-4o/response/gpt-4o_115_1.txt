To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(A|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

where:

- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|A)\) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the marginal probability of Jason's description.

First, let's compute the prior probability, \(P(A)\):

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- Similarly, \(P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

To proceed, we need to estimate \(P(D|A)\) and \(P(D|B)\). Given that Jason's description includes traits like being emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, these traits may be less common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors. Therefore:

- We assume \(P(D|A)\) is relatively low. Let's assign an arbitrary probability, say \(P(D|A) = 0.1\).
- We assume \(P(D|B)\) is relatively high. Let's assign an arbitrary probability, say \(P(D|B) = 0.8\).

Now we calculate \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Finally, we can find the posterior probability, \(P(A|D)\):

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|D) = 0.04 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is 0.04.

Therefore, the answer is:
