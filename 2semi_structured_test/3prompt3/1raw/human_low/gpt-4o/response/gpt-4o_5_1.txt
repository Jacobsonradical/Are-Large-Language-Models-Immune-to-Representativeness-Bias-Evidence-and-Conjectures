To assess the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (our goal).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description across all professors.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \):
   Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample:
   \[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \):
   This is the tricky part. We need to estimate the likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's description. Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and not particularly technical, these traits are less typical for a stereotype of a computer science professor and more typical for someone in the humanities. Therefore, we might estimate:

   \[ P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \] is relatively low.

3. **Total Probability** \( P(B) \):
   This is the weighted sum of the probabilities of Jason's description across both groups:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]

   Since Jason's description is more typical of a humanities professor:
   \[ P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) \] is relatively high.

For simplicity, we'll assume:
\[ P(B|\text{CS Professor}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) = 0.9 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

The approximate posterior probability is:
