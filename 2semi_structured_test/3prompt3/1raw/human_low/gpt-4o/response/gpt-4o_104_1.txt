To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' Theorem. We need the following components:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability that a random professor is from Computer Science.
   - \( P(\text{H}) \): Probability that a random professor is from Humanities.
   
   Since there are 25 Computer Science professors and 75 Humanities professors:
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a Computer Science professor.
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a Humanities professor.

   Based on the description provided ("creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate but not technical"), it seems more indicative of someone from the Humanities than from Computer Science. For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) = 0.9 \)
   
3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - We are interested in \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Calculating \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now, use this to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
