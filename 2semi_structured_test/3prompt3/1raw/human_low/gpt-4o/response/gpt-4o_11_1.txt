To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which will allow us to update our prior beliefs based on the new evidence provided by the description of Jason.

Let's define the following:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): Evidence provided by the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | E) = \frac{P(E | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(C | E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence. 

### Step 1: Determine Priors
1. **Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(C) \)):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100.
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)):**
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100.
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

### Step 2: Determine Likelihoods

We need the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis:

1. **Likelihood of the evidence given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(E | C) \)):**
   - Given the description seems more aligned with traits typically expected in humanities based on creativity, emotional drive, and non-technical nature, let's assume a lower probability for computer science. For the sake of argument, letâ€™s say this is \( P(E | C) = 0.1 \).

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(E | H) \)):**
   - The description fits well with traits often associated with humanities professors. Let's assign a higher probability here, say \( P(E | H) = 0.7 \).

### Step 3: Calculate Marginal Likelihood

\[ P(E) = P(E | C) \cdot P(C) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.7 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Theorem

\[ P(C | E) = \frac{P(E | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C | E) \approx 0.0455 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is roughly 0.0455.

Therefore, the answer would be:

```json
{"probability": "0.0455"}
