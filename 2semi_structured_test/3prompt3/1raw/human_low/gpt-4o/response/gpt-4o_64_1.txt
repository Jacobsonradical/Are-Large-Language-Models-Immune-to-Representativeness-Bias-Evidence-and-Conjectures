To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D) \). Since we only have qualitative data about the traits, an illustrative approach would be to make reasonable assumptions based on common stereotypes and descriptions typical for those fields:

- The given description of Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not technical might stereotypically align more with the humanities than computer science. Let's assume:
  - \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (assuming a low probability but not zero)
  - \( P(D | H) = 0.4 \) (assuming a higher relative probability for humanities)

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.3 = 0.325 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]

\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
