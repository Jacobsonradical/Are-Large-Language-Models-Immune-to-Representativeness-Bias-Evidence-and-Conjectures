Based on the description of Jason, I'll apply Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability given the evidence provided. Here's a structured approach to determining the posterior probability:

1. **Prior Probability**: The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (CS) versus humanities (H) is derived from the sample sizes. There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the given description if the professor is from CS or humanities.
   - Jason's description does not align strongly with the stereotypical traits associated with computer science professors (technical, analytical). Thus, we might estimate the likelihood to be lower for CS than for humanities. 
   - For humanities, the traits like creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical resonate more. 

Letâ€™s assign rough likelihood values:
   - \( P(description \mid CS) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(description \mid H) = 0.5 \)

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS \mid description) \):
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4
   \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\{
    "probability": "0.0625"
\}
\]
