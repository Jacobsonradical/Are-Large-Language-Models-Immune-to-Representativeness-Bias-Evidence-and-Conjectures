Given the description of Jason and the details about the sample, we aim to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, letâ€™s denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of Jason's description occurring.

From the provided information:
- The number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (H) = 75

The priors are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \).

Given the description of Jason, it suggests he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical." These traits tend to be more frequently associated with humanities professors. So, we might assume:
\[ P(D | H) \gg P(D | CS) \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \), we adjust this as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given the qualitative nature, even without precise numerical values, we believe \( P(D | CS) \) is much lower compared to \( P(D | H) \).

So, in conclusion, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the provided qualitative description and the relative sizes of the groups, would likely be low.

Estimating numerically, we might say:
\[ \left( \text{assuming} \ P(D | CS) \ \text{is much smaller than} \ P(D | H) \right) \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx \frac{0.25 \times \text{small value}}{0.25 \times \text{small value} + 0.75 \times \text{large value}} \]

For the sake of estimation, we might approximate this posterior as:
\[ \approx \frac{0.25 \times 0.1}{0.25 \times 0.1 + 0.75 \times 0.9} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus:
