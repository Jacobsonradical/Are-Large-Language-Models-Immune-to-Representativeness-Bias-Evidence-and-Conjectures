To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{H}) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \)).
   - The complementary likelihood is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \)).

Given Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and other traits, which seem more stereotypically aligned with computer science, it's reasonable to assume that these likelihoods have significant weight towards the computer science professors. However, since exact likelihoods are not given, we need to make an educated assessment based on the description itself. 

For simplicity and based on the traits described, we can assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \). Let’s assume:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Calculation:**

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Similarly:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus,
