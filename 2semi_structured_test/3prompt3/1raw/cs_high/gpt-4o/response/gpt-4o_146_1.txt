To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the formulation of Bayes' theorem for this problem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description being associated with a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

We start with the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- The total number of professors is 100. 
- 75 are in computer science (CS) and 25 in the humanities (H).

So, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
Similarly, \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we consider the likelihoods. The description of Jason mentions several attributes, such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are stereotypically more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

Given these details, we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \) is higher, let’s say around 0.9 (indicative of a strong correlation with the traits of a typical computer science professor).
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{H}) \) is lower, let’s say around 0.1 (indicative of a weaker correlation with the traits of a typical humanities professor).

To find \( P(\text{description}) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.675) + (0.025) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
