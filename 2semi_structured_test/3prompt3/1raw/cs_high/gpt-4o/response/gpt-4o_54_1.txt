To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- \( P(A_{\text{H}}) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we'll need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) = Probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \) = Probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor because his interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not in drawing or writing) align more closely with what one might expect from a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) = 0.1 \)

Now, we can calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{H}}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \):
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.
