To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of observing the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of observing the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS | D) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(H | D) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description \( D \).

The priors are given by the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) P(H)}{P(D)} \]

To find \( P(D) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) P(CS) + P(D | H) P(H) \]

Given the description of Jason, it seems much more aligned with characteristics typical of someone in computer science due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles and his disinterest in drawing or writing. However, specific probabilities are not provided. We'll assume that the description aligns better with a computer science professor; thus, \( P(D | CS) \) is likely higher than \( P(D | H) \).

Assuming:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \]

Substituting these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Then we find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
