To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to consider how likely it is for a person with Jason's characteristics to belong to each group. Based on the given description, Jason seems more aligned with a computer science professor due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, we need a more quantitative assessment.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of a computer science professor fitting Jason's description.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of a humanities professor fitting Jason's description.

Given Jason's clear leaning towards activities typically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles), we might estimate:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

So the answer is: \{"probability": "0.964"\}
