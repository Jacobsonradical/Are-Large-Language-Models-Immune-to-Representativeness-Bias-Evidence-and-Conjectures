To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our event of interest:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given the prior probabilities:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Let \(D\) represent the description provided. We are interested in \(P(C|D)\).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

The denominator \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\) occurring:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors. Assuming the description fits more closely with common traits of computer science professors, let's make the following reasonable assumptions:
- \(P(D|C) = 0.9\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.2\)

Now we can compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, calculate \(P(C|D)\):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) â‰ˆ 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.931.
