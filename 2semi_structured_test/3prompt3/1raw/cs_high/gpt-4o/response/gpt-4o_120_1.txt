To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors among 100 professors in total, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The remaining 25 are humanities professors, so \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(B | A) \)) and that he is a humanities professor (\( P(B | A^c) \)).

Given Jasonâ€™s enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are activities more typical of a computer science professor, we can assume that:
  - \( P(B | A) \) is relatively high. Let's estimate it at around 0.8.
  - Conversely, \( P(B | A^c) \) is likely low. Let's estimate it at around 0.1.

3. **Total probability of the description:**
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.025 = 0.625 \]

4. **Posterior probability:**
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]

\[ P(A | B) = 0.96 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
