To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps to update the probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{HU} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): The description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(H_{CS} | E) \), i.e., the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) is the probability of the description \( E \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the description \( E \).

First, we assign the priors based on the number of professors in each group:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(H_{CS}) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(H_{HU}) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{HU}) \).

Given Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing), it seems more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assume:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \): High, say 0.9 (since coding and mathematical puzzles are typically associated with computer science).
- \( P(E | H_{HU}) \): Low, say 0.1 (since humanities professors are less likely to have these specific interests).

\( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description \( E \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{HU}) \cdot P(H_{HU}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.75)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
