To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The application of Bayes' theorem in this context requires considering both the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description fitting the profiles for each group (computer science versus humanities professors).

1. **Prior Probability:**
   The number of computer science professors is 75 out of a total of 100 professors:

   \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

   The number of humanities professors is 25 out of a total of 100 professors:

   \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \), can be reasonably considered higher because his interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) align more closely with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor.

   The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \), would be considered lower because his description does not closely align with a stereotypical humanities professor who might have more interest in drawing or writing.

   Given the description, we can make a qualitative assumption that:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is much higher than \( P(D|H) \). 

   For simplicity, let's approximate these likelihoods:
   - Let's say \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
   - And \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculating \( P(CS|D) \):
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
