Given the description of Jason and the details of the study, let's consider the information provided to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

The problem lends itself to applying Bayes' theorem. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason includes several traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.
   - While exact likelihood values \(P(\text{description} | CS)\) and \(P(\text{description} | H)\) are not provided, we can reasonably assume that the likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits is higher than a humanities professor having these traits.

Given the strong alignment of Jason's interests and characteristics with those commonly found in computer science, we can infer:

- \(P(\text{description} | CS) > P(\text{description} | H)\)

For simplicity, we can consider the likelihoods provided for similar problems or make a reasonable estimate. Let's assume:

- \(P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9\) (high likelihood but not certain)
- \(P(\text{description} | H) = 0.2\) (lower likelihood since coding and mathematical puzzles are rare interests for humanities professors)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation (Using Bayes' Theorem):**
   \[
   P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description}|CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description}|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05} = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\{
   "probability": "0.93"
\}
