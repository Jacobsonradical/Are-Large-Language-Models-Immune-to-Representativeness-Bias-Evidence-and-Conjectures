Given the description of Jason and needing to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor, we apply Bayesian reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - We need to start with the prior probabilities. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that the description is of a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Similarly, the prior probability \( P(\text{Hum}) \) that the description is of a humanities professor is:
     \[
     P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood Analysis:**
   - We need to assess how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor:
     - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science. Also, traits such as being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious can be found in both fields, but the specific hobbies are more closely associated with computer science.
     - Although he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more closely related to the humanities, this does not provide strong evidence against him being a computer science professor.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
   - Applying Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     - We need to estimate \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \).
     - The description is highly indicative of a computer science professor (coding and solving mathematical puzzles). Let's assign hypothetical values:
       \[
       P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9
       \]
       \[
       P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) = 0.1
       \]
     - The total probability, \( P(\text{Description}) \), is a weighted sum:
       \[
       P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
       \]
       \[
       P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
       \]

   - Now the posterior probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
     \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.964"}}
\]
