To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event "Jason is a computer science professor".
- \( H \) as the event "Jason is a humanities professor".
- \( D \) as the given personality description.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the normalizing constant.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods, \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description suggests attributes and interests that align more with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.). Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (a higher probability since Jason's interests are strongly related to computer science).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (a lower probability since Jason's interests are less related to the humanities).

The normalizing constant \( P(D) \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
