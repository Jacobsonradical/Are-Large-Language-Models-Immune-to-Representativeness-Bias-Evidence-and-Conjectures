Given the description of Jason and the information about the study, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about whether Jason is one of the computer science professors.

To start with, let's review the numbers and prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the total 100 professors.
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's consider \( P(D|CS) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, traits more common in computer science, we might assign this a high probability. Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \).

Next, let's consider \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given that Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more common activities among humanities professors, we might assign this a lower probability. Assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

Now, let's calculate \( P(D) \), the overall probability of the description. This can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of the description occurring in each group weighted by the respective prior probabilities:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.964.
