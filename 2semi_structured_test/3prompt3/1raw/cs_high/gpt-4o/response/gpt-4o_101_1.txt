Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \): Probability that Jason is from the computer science group. This is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(A_{Hum}) \): Probability that Jason is from the humanities group. This is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, let's make reasonable assumptions based on the description provided:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. Given these hobbies, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

Hence, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor is high. We'll estimate this at approximately 0.9.
- \( P(B|A_{Hum}) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor is relatively lower. We'll estimate this at approximately 0.1.

Now we compute the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \times P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{Hum}) \times P(A_{Hum}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A_{CS}|B) \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \times P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, based on the given information and our reasonable assumptions, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
