To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here are the steps involved:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS) and P(Hum))**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science, P(CS), is 75/100 = 0.75.
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities, P(Hum), is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Likelihood (P(Desc | CS) and P(Desc | Hum))**:
   - To estimate this, we consider how typical the description is for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given the information, Jason's activities and interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it's more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. Although exact numbers are not provided, we can make a reasoned assumption:
     - Suppose the likelihood of this description for a computer science professor, P(Desc | CS), is high, for instance, 0.8.
     - Suppose the likelihood of this description for a humanities professor, P(Desc | Hum), is lower, say 0.2.

3. **Bayes' Theorem Application**:
   - We need to calculate the posterior probability P(CS | Desc) using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
     \]
   - First, calculate the total probability of the description, P(Desc):
     \[
     P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
     \]
     \[
     P(Desc) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
     \]

   - Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
     \]

Therefore, based on the steps and the given data, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
