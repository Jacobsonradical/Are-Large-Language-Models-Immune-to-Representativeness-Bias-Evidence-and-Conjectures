To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

Thus,
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's estimate the likelihoods:
\(P(B | A_{CS})\): The probability that a description like Jason's fits a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, puzzles, jogging, creativity but not in writing/drawing), it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor.

\(P(B | A_{Humanities})\): The probability that a description like Jason's fits a humanities professor. Although possible, it is relatively less likely given the typical interests and activities described (coding, puzzles).

To simplify the analysis given the context:
- Let's assume the description is quite representative for computer science professors (\(P(B | A_{CS})\)) around 0.9.
- For humanities professors, it's less typical, perhaps around 0.1 (\(P(B | A_{Humanities})\)).

Now let's calculate the normalizing constant \(P(B)\) which is:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B | A_{Humanities}) \cdot P(A_{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
