To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's outline the prior probabilities and relevant data:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (HU), which gives a prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we assess the likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which aligns more closely with typical activities of a computer science professor. However, we don't have precise likelihood values from the prompt, so we use reasonable assumptions:

- Let \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) represent the probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor. For simplicity, we assign a high likelihood, say \( 0.9 \).
- Let \( P(\text{Description} | HU) \) represent the probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor. Since the description does not closely align with typical activities of a humanities professor, we assign a lower likelihood, say \( 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we update our belief:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | HU) \times P(HU) \]

From the numbers we have:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is:
