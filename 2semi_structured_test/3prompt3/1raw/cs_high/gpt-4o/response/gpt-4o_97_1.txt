To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \( H \) as the event "Jason is a humanities professor."

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(B|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, this is likely high.
   - \( P(B|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description, this is likely lower because of Jason's strong inclination towards technical activities.

We can assume that \( P(B|CS) \) is relatively higher than \( P(B|H) \). However, we must estimate these values to proceed. Let's provide reasonable estimates:

- Assume \( P(B|CS) = 0.9 \)
- Assume \( P(B|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Total Probability**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \times P(CS) + P(B|H) \times P(H) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

4. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
