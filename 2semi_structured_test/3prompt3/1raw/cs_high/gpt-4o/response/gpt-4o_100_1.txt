To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Given the description of Jason, we want to calculate \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability:**
    \( P(\text{CS}) \) = probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science 
    \[
    P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]

    \( P(\text{Hum}) \) = probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities 
    \[
    P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

2. **Likelihood:**
    We need \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \).

    Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, along with being conservative, careful, and talented, these traits are more commonly associated with computer science professors.

    Let's assign reasonable values (these are subjective probabilities based on the description):
    \[
    P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) = 0.1
    \]

3. **Normalization Constant:**
    \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, combining both groups.
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
    \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
    \[
    P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description is approximately 0.9643.
