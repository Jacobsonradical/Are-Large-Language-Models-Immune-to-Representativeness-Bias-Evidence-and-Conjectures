To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes’ theorem. 

First, we have the prior probabilities:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given each profession:
- The description of Jason includes activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors.
- Given Jason’s activities and interests, it is natural to assume these traits are more likely in a computer science professor than in a humanities professor.

However, we need to qualitatively assess how much more likely:
- Let's assume the likelihood of such a description if Jason is a computer science professor is relatively high, let's denote this as P(Desc|CS) = 0.9.
- On the other hand, if Jason was a humanities professor, such a description would be less likely, let’s say P(Desc|H) = 0.1.

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{(0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)} \]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675 \)

Denominator: \( (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \)

So the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
