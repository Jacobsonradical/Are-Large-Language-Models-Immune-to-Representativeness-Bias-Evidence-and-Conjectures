To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We need to establish the following probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science group.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities group.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \).
   - We need to estimate the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \).

Based on Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.), it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assume the likelihoods as follows:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is high, say, 0.8.
- \( P(D|H) \) is low, say, 0.1.

3. **Normalization Constant**:
   - The total probability of observing Jason's description.
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.025 = 0.625
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} = \frac{0.6}{0.625} = 0.96
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

```json
{"probability": "0.96"}
