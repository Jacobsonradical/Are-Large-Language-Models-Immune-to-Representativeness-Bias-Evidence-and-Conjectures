To solve this problem, we need to update our initial beliefs (priors) with the new evidence provided (Bayesian updating). 

### Prior Probabilities:
- Probability that the professor is from Computer Science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that the professor is from Humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### Likelihoods:
We look at the description of Jason and evaluate how likely such a description would be for a professor in each field.

Given Jason's inclination towards coding, mathematical puzzles, and jogging, combined with his conservative and careful nature, traits like coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with a typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- Likelihood of the description given a CS professor: \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) (high because coding and mathematical puzzles are strongly indicative of CS)
- Likelihood of the description given a Humanities professor: \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (lower, as these activities are less typical for humanities professors)

### Posterior Probability:
We use Bayes' theorem to combine these.

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{(0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
