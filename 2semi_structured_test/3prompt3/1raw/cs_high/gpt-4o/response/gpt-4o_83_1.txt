To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The information we have can help us update our beliefs about the likelihood based on the given description.

Given:

- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \).

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: 
  \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

\( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of Jason being described as such given he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more with common interests in computer science.

\( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of Jason being described as such given he is a humanities professor. Given the description does not mention common interests associated with the humanities, this likelihood may be lower.

Let's approximate these likelihoods based on the description:

- \( P(D|C) \): Higher, say about 0.9
- \( P(D|H) \): Lower, say about 0.2

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.93"}
