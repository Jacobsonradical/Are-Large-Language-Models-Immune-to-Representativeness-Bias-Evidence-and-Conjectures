To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (P(Desc|CS)): This is the likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description. Given his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, this likelihood is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(Desc|CS) = 0.9 \), a typical high probability.
   - Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (P(Desc|Hum)): Given his lack of interest in writing and enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, this likelihood is relatively low. Let's assume \( P(Desc|Hum) = 0.1 \), a typical low probability.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   We use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) \) is the total probability of Jason's description under all possible categories (CS and Humanities):

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(Desc) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.7 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) \approx 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
