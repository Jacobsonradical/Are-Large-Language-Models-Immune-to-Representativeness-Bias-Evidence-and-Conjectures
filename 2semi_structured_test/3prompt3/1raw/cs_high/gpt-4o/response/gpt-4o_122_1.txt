To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here, we compare the likelihood of Jason's description fitting either a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

First, let's outline Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\).

1. **Prior Probability \(P(CS)\)**:
   - Number of computer science professors: 75.
   - Number of humanities professors: 25.
   So, the prior probability \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood \(P(D | CS)\)**:
   - Jason's description strongly aligns with typical characteristics of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.). For simplicity, let's assign a high likelihood to this, say 0.9.

3. **Likelihood \(P(D | Humanities)\)**:
   - Jason's description does not align as well with typical characteristics of humanities professors (not interested in drawing or writing, enjoys coding/math puzzles, etc.). We might assign a much lower likelihood, say 0.1.

4. **Total Probability \(P(D)\)**:
   This is a weighted average of the description's likelihood across both groups.
   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.964"}
