To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description appearing in the sample.

Let's define:
- Event \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- Event \( A' \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \), we consider the given description. The traits and interests such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being conservative and careful are more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let's assume the following likelihoods, acknowledging they are subjective but based on the given traits:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high probability, since these traits are common for a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.1 \) (low probability, since these traits are less common for a humanities professor)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
