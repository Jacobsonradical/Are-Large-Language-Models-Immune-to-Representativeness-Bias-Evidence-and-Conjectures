To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The problem provides us with the following prior probabilities and likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability of Being a Computer Science Professor (CS Prof):**
   - Number of CS professors: 75
   - Total number of professors: 100
   - Prior probability (P(CS Prof)) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Prior Probability of Being a Humanities Professor (Hum Prof):**
   - Number of Humanities professors: 25
   - Total number of professors: 100
   - Prior probability (P(Hum Prof)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the observed description ("Jason's description") given that he's a CS Professor versus a Humanities Professor. This part can be subjective, yet we can follow a logical approach.

3. **Likelihood of the Description Given CS Professor (P(Description | CS Prof))**:
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and joggingâ€”activities more common among computer science professors.
   - He does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities more common among humanities professors.
   - Therefore, this likelihood reasonably suggests a high value.

4. **Likelihood of the Description Given Humanities Professor (P(Description | Hum Prof))**:
   - Given the description, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor seems lower because his interests align more with typical attributes of a computer science professor.

Though exact values may be subjective, we'll assign reasonable likelihoods:
- P(Description | CS Prof) = 0.9 (high likelihood because his interests align with CS)
- P(Description | Hum Prof) = 0.1 (low likelihood as interests align less with Humanities)

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS Prof | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS Prof) * P(CS Prof)}{P(Description | CS Prof) * P(CS Prof) + P(Description | Hum Prof) * P(Hum Prof)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS Prof | Description) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS Prof | Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(CS Prof | Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS Prof | Description) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
