To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description of Jason that we are given.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:

- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

Given the hobbies and interests mentioned in Jason's description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and not enjoying drawing or writing), it is reasonable to assume that such preferences are more likely for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor.

Let's assume:

- \(P(D|C) \approx 0.9\) (high likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description)
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.1\) (low likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description)

Now we calculate \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(C|D)\):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
