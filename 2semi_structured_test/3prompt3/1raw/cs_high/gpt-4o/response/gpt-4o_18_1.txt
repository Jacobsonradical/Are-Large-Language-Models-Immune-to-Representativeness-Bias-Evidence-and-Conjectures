Given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, we note the prior probabilities:
- Probability (Jason is a computer science professor) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability (Jason is a humanities professor) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we assess the likelihood of the description given Jason's field. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely associated with computer science. Being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious could apply to both fields, but the specific interests of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly point towards computer science.

To keep it simple, I'll assume the likelihood ratio is significantly higher for computer science professors over humanities professors, based on Jason's interests.

Let's set:
- P(description | computer science) = 0.9 (since he enjoys coding and puzzles, which are more common in computer science)
- P(description | humanities) = 0.1 (since these interests are much less common in humanities)

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(\text{computer science} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{computer science}) \times P(\text{computer science})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{computer science}) \times P(\text{computer science}) + P(\text{description} | \text{humanities}) \times P(\text{humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]
\[ P(\text{computer science} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.964 \]

Therefore, my estimate of the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
