To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description being given.

Given the study sample, we have:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.
- A total of 100 professors.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):
- The probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(B|A) \): Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it is likely very high for a computer science professor. For estimation, let's use \( P(B|A) \approx 0.90 \).
- The probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(B|A^c) \) is likely lower considering the specific interests in coding and mathematical puzzles. For an estimate, letâ€™s use \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.20 \).

Now, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.90 \cdot 0.75) + (0.20 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.

Answer: {"probability": "0.931"}
