To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's establish the numbers involved:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability (before considering Jason's description) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)). Given Jasonâ€™s inclination towards coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume that these traits are more likely for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor. 

For the sake of this calculation, let's assume the following approximate likelihoods based on his description:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (highly likely that such a description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (unlikely that such a description fits a humanities professor)

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the response is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
