To determine the posterior probability, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) is the description fitting Jason

We are trying to find \( P(A|B) \).

First, we need to know the following:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description fitting any professor

Our given data is:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \), is \[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We now need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a computer science professor has Jason's traits. Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are highly indicative of a computer science background, this likelihood is high.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that a humanities professor has Jason's traits. Humanities professors are less likely to be characterized by an enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, making this likelihood lower.

Because Bayes' theorem also needs the total probability of the description \( P(B) \), let's calculate it as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Let's assume some reasonable probabilities given the context. Suppose \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) and \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

Thus,

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
