To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the setup:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor, and \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, both of which are more stereotypically aligned with computer science. 
- His lack of interest in drawing or writing, while being highly creative, also aligns more stereotypically with computer science than the humanities.

Letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]

Now we calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

The answer, in the specified format, is:
