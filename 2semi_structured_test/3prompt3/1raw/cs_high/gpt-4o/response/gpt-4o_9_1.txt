Alright, to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total pool consists of 100 professors (75 CS + 25 Humanities).

Bayes' Theorem can be expressed in terms of probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probability \( P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Jason being a humanities professor:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. This is more subjective, but based on the description:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are very strong indicators he is likely from computer science.
- These activities are less typical for a humanities professor.

So, it is reasonable to assume:

\[ P(D|CS) \] is relatively high, letâ€™s estimate it to be around 0.9.
\[ P(D|H) \] is relatively low, an estimate could be around 0.1.

Now, we can determine \( P(D) \) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.964 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{"probability": "0.964"\}
