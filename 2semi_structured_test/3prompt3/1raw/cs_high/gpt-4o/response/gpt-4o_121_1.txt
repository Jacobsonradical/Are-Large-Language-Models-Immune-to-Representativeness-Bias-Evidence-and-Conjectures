To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the posterior probability based on prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given evidence.

Here’s how we'll approach this:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate) Information:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(\text{CS})\), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(\text{H})\), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
   - The likelihood that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

Given Jason’s interests and attributes, which include coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is much more likely he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Let's denote these likelihoods as:
   - \(P(D|\text{CS})\), the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(D|\text{H})\), the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Due to the nature of Jason's interests and talents, the likelihood \(P(D|\text{CS})\) is higher than \(P(D|\text{H})\).

For simplicity, let's use hypothetical numbers to represent these likelihoods:
   - Assume \(P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.9\) (high likelihood given his interests are strongly aligned with computer science).
   - Assume \(P(D|\text{H}) = 0.1\) (low likelihood given his interests do not align well with typical humanities interests).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
   - We apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

\[P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}\]

\[P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})\]

\[P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)\]

\[P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025\]

\[P(D) = 0.7\]

\[P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}\]

\[P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}\]

\[P(\text{CS}|D) = 0.9643\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.9643.

In conclusion, the posterior probability is:
