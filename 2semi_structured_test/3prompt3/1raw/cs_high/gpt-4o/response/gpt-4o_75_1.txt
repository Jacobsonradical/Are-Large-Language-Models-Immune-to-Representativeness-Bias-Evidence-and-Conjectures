```{"probability": "0.75"}```

Explanation:

1. **Base Rates**: There are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. So the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor is 75/100 = 0.75, and the prior probability that he is a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Traits and Interests**: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might typically be more associated with the humanities.

Given Jason's interests and creative preferences align more closely with those typically seen in computer science rather than the humanities, it strengthens the initial prior probability.

Hence, taking both the base rates and the personality description into account, the posterior probability is maintained at around 75%, indicating that it is quite likely Jason is a computer science professor in the sample.
