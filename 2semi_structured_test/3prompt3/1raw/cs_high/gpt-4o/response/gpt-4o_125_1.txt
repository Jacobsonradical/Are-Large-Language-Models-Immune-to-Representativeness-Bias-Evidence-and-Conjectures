To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Prior Probability
First, consider the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability (P(H)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Likelihood
Next, evaluate the likelihood of the description given Jason's profession.

Based on the description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: more indicative of a computer science professor.
- Highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing: less indicative of a humanities professor.

### Step 3: Posterior Probability
We need to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let’s denote:
- D as the description provided.

We need to calculate: \( P(CS|D) \)

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the normalizing constant, which ensures the posterior probabilities sum to 1.

### Step 4: Estimating Likelihoods
Assuming:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) can mean that the description fits computer science professors very well.
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) can mean that the description fits humanities professors poorly.

### Step 5: Normalizing Constant (P(D))
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

### Step 6: Applying Bayes' Theorem
Now compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96.
