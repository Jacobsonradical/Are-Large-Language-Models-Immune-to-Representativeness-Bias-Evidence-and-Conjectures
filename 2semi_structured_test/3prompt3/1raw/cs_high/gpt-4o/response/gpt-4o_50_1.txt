To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's how we can break it down:

- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that the description matches a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

We know from the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Therefore, \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description seems to fit the profile of a computer science professor quite well due to mentions of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. Conversely, it is less aligned with typical humanities interests such as drawing or writing.

Let's make a reasonable assumption about the likelihoods:
- Assume that the likelihood of such a description for a computer science professor, \( P(B|A) \), is high. Let’s set it at 0.8.
- Assume the likelihood of such a description for a humanities professor, \( P(B|\neg A) \), is low. Let’s set it at 0.1.

Now, let's calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.625 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.96 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.96"}
