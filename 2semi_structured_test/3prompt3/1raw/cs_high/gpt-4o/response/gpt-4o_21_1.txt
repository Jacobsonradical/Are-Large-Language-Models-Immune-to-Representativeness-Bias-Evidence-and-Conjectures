To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | E) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence (the description).
- \( P(E | CS) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Firstly, letâ€™s determine the prior probability \( P(CS) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we determine \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \) where \( H \) represents the humanities professors:
- Given the description of Jason (interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, being conservative and ambitious), it seems more in line with the profile of a computer science professor.
- While we do not have exact probabilities for \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \), we can make an informed estimation that \( P(E | CS) \) (the probability of this description given Jason is a computer science professor) is higher than \( P(E | H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(E | CS) = 0.8 \) (high probability)
- \( P(E | H) = 0.2 \) (low probability)

Now, use marginal probability \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | E) \approx 0.923 \]

Thus the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

So, the final answer is: 

{"probability": "0.923"}
