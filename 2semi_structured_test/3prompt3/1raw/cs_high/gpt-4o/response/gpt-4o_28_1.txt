To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jason's description.

First, let’s determine the priors and likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \):**
   - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
     \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):**
   - Given Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) and personal description, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor.
   - While exact numbers are not provided, we assign high likelihood values. Let’s assume:
     \[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \] (high likelihood due to strong alignment with typical characteristics of a computer science professor)
     \[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \] (low likelihood due to less alignment with typical characteristics of a humanities professor)

4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \):**
   - The overall probability of observing Jason's description:
     \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964, which rounds to 0.96.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.96"}
