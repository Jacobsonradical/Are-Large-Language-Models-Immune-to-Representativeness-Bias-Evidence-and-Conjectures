To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the probabilities of the description \( P(B|A) \) if Jason is a computer science professor and \( P(B|\neg A) \) if Jason is a humanities professor:
- The description includes traits (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) that are more typical of a computer science professor.
- While exact probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are not provided, we can reasonably infer that:
  - \( P(B|A) \) is higher because the description aligns closely with the profile of a computer science professor.
  - \( P(B|\neg A) \) is lower because the matches for a humanities professor are fewer given the description.

For this example, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \)

Now, we find \( P(B) \) which is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \times 0.75)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
