Let's start by using Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the normalizing constant, which ensures the posterior probabilities sum to one.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \):**
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \):**
Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more strongly associated with computer science than with humanities. His lack of interest in drawing or writing is also more consistent with common traits of computer science professors.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is high. Let's assign a high probability here, say 0.9, recognizing that it is a subjective but reasonable estimation.

3. **Total Probability \( P(\text{description}) \):**
This can be broken down into its components:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Assuming \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) is low because the traits are less likely to describe a humanities professor, we can assign it a probability of 0.2. Therefore:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence:

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]

\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.725 \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.93"}} \]
