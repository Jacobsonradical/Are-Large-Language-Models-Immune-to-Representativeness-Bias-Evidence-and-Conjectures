Let's analyze the details given to update our posterior probability. The initial (prior) probabilities are:
- Probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to assess how likely Jason's description fits the profile of a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description highlights several traits and activities, which we will evaluate:

1. **Interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles**: These activities are much more commonly associated with computer science.
2. **High creativity but no interest in drawing/writing**: This may fit more with a computer science professor, as humanities often involves writing.
3. **Conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious**: These traits can be common in both fields, though conservativeness might lean more towards certain disciplines.

Considering Jason's interests and traits, it's reasonable to assume he's more likely a computer science professor. However, we also should respect that there is some non-zero probability he is in the humanities.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to update our probabilities. Given the description (\( D \)), we want \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

We follow a similar process for \( P(H | D) \):

\[
P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

The likelihood ratio \( P(D | CS) / P(D | H) \) needs to be assessed next. Given Jason's interest primarily aligns with characteristics of computer science professors, we could estimate:

- \( P(D | CS) \) to be relatively high
- \( P(D | H) \) to be relatively low

Without precise probabilities, let’s assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) = 0.9
- \( P(D | H) \) = 0.1

Thus:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} 
= \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} 
= \frac{0.675}{0.7} 
≈ 0.964
\]

So, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.964"}
