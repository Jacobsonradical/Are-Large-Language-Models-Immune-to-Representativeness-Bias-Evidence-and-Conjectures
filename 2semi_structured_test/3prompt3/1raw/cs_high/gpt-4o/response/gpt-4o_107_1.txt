To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem. Here is how we can proceed:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (prior):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
     \[
     P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor (P(description | CS)).
   - Similarly, we need the likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor (P(description | Humanities)).

Given the description, Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests he is more likely a computer science professor. His lack of interest in drawing or writing leans even more towards computer science over humanities.

While these likelihoods are subjective, given the strong indications toward computer science, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   
   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]
   
   Now, calculating the posterior:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
