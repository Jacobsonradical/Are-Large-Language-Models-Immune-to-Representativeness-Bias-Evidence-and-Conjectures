To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B (i.e., the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A (i.e., the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A (i.e., the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B (i.e., the probability of Jason's description from the entire sample of professors).

First, we define our parts:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We need the likelihood terms:
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging), it is more likely aligned with characteristics typical of a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \)

Then, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.923"}
