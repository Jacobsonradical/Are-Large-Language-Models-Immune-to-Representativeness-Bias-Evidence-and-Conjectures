Let's analyze the given information to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities and use Bayes' theorem. We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
- Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H) is:
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

Given Jason's description, we need to consider how likely it is for a CS professor or a humanities professor (given their general traits) to match this description. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, both activities strongly associated with computer science. This makes it much more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need to define these probabilities more formally.

Let's assume:
- The probability of a CS professor matching Jason's description is \( P(D \mid CS) \)
- The probability of a humanities professor matching Jason's description is \( P(D \mid H) \)

Due to his activities (coding, mathematical puzzles) aligning well with traits of a CS professor, we can reasonably assume that:
  \[
  P(D \mid CS) = 0.9
  \]
And since those activities aren't common in the humanities, we can assume:
  \[
  P(D \mid H) = 0.2
  \]

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:
\[
0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675
\]
\[
0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.05
\]
\[
0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725
\]

Now, the final posterior probability:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.931"}
