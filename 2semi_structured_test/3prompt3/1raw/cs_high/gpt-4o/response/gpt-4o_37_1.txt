Given the description of Jason, we need to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

To apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The base rates of the two groups: 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Assess which group is more likely to fit the description of Jason. Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these activities align more closely with the interests typical of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. Jason's other attributes, such as being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, as well as enjoying jogging, are not explicitly aligned to either group but do not contradict the CS profile.
   
3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - We assume the likelihood ratio favors the computer science professors given Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles.
   - Letâ€™s denote:
     \[
     P(\text{Description } | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description } | \text{H}) \approx 0.1
     \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]
Since:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

We plug in the values:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Thus,
\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.96"}
