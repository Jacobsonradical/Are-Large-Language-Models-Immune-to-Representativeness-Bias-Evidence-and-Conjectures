To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a breakdown of the relevant steps and calculations:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(D|CS) \): Probability that a computer science professor has Jason's description
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability that a humanities professor has Jason's description

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
   - By Bayes’ theorem:
\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac {P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)} {P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} 
\]

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely to be associated with computer science professors than humanities professors.

Assuming Jason’s interests are more common among computer science professors, we'll assign \( P(D|CS) \) a higher value than \( P(D|H) \).

Let’s assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) (as his traits and interests match more with computer science)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (as his traits and interests are less common in the humanities)

Now plugging in the values into the formula:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac {0.8 \cdot 0.75} {0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} 
\]

Calculations:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac {0.6} {0.6 + 0.05} 
       = \frac {0.6} {0.65} 
       = \frac {60} {65} 
       \approx 0.923 
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.923"}
