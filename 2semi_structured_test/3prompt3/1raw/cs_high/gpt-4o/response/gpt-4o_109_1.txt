To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define our variables:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(C) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need estimates for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description given each of the two categories. Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems highly indicative of a computer science professor. Therefore, we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability given the description matches a typical computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability given the description does not match a typical humanities professor)

Finally, \( P(D) \) is computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.964"} \]
