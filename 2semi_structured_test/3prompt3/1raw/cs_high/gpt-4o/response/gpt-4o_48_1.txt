To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason.

From the information given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, Jason exhibits traits that are more stereotypically associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. Thus, it's reasonable to assume that \( P(D|C) > P(D|H) \).

Let's make a reasonable qualitative estimate for these probabilities:
- Suppose \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (highly likely description of a computer science professor).
- Suppose \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (less likely description of a humanities professor).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
