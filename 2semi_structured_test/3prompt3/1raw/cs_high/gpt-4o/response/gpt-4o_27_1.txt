Given the description, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given all the provided details.

First, let's use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided of Jason.

### Prior Probability: \( P(A) \)

This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:

\[ 
P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 
\]

### Likelihood: \( P(B|A) \)

This is the likelihood of having the description \( B \) if Jason is a computer science professor. The key details of the description suggest an affinity for coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors.

Let's denote this likelihood as \( L_{CS} \). Since every detail aligns well with the typical interests of a computer science professor, we can assume a high likelihood. Let's assume \( L_{CS} = 0.9 \) as a reasonable estimate based on the given traits.

### Prior Probability: \( P(\neg A) \)

This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:

\[ 
P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 
\]

### Likelihood: \( P(B|\neg A) \)

This is the likelihood of having the description \( B \) if Jason is a humanities professor. The affinity for coding and solving mathematical puzzles is less common among humanities professors.

Let's denote this likelihood as \( L_{Hum} \). Since these interests are somewhat uncharacteristic for a humanities professor, we estimate a lower likelihood. Let's assume \( L_{Hum} = 0.2 \) as a reasonable estimate.

### Total Probability: \( P(B) \)

This is the total probability of the description regardless of the type of professor, calculated by weighing each likelihood with their respective prior probabilities:

\[ 
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) 
\]

So:

\[ 
P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 
\]

\[ 
P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725 
\]

### Posterior Probability: \( P(A|B) \)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} 
\]

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} 
\]

\[ 
P(A|B) \approx 0.931 
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ 
{"probability": "0.931"} 
\]
