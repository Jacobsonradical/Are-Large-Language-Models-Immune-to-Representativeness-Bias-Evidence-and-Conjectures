To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

We need to determine the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's characteristics given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason's characteristics.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\( P(A) \): The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\( P(A^c) \): The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor from the sample.
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that Jason has these characteristics given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability that Jason has these characteristics given he is a humanities professor.

Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing strongly suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor. Therefore, we will assume \( P(B|A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A^c) \). For simplicity, let's assign reasonable estimates:

Assuming:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \]

Now we use the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
