Based on the description provided, several factors align more closely with a typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities more commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, the information provided does not mention any interests or activities typical of someone in the humanities, such as a profound interest in literature, history, or arts.

The original base rate or prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) and for being a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given the description, we update the prior probability (base rate) with the likelihood of someone with Jason's profile being either a computer science or a humanities professor. The details provided strongly suggest Jason aligns more with the typical profile of a computer science professor.

Taking into consideration both the base rate and the profile:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.95 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.05 \]

Hence, the updated posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.95"}
