To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We start by defining:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

From the description, Jason seems to have traits commonly associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), which may lead us to assume \( P(D | CS) \) is high, and traits less associated with the humanities, suggesting \( P(D | H) \) is lower. Though the exact likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are not provided, we can make an educated guess.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving puzzles, traits more typical for computer science, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can calculate \( P(D) \) as follows:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, we can determine \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.964"}
