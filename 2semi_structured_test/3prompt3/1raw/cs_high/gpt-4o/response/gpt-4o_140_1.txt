To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( D \) be the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the likelihoods of the description given the two categories. 

Based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with computer science professors.
- Keywords like "conservative," "careful," "talented," "ambitious," and "highly creative" can apply to successful individuals in any field but align more with the structured and analytical nature of computer science rather than the humanities.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that:
- \( P(D|C) \) (the probability that a computer science professor matches the description) is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \).
- \( P(D|H) \) (the probability that a humanities professor matches the description) is relatively lower. Let's assume \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \).

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.923 \]

Hence, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.923.
