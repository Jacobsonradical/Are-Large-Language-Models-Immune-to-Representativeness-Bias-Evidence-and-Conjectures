To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we are looking to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100, so the prior probability, \( P(CS) \), that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The prior probability, \( P(Hum) \), that Jason is a humanities professor is:
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the observed description given the professor's field. This is more subjective and based on Jasonâ€™s interests and characteristics:
     - Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles: These are more strongly associated with computer science.
     - Conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious: Common traits but can be seen in both fields.
     - Does not enjoy drawing or writing but is highly creative: Again, points towards computer science as creativity can manifest in problem-solving and coding.

   Let's assign some rough probabilities for the description given each field, although these are subjective and serve as estimates:
   - \( P(description | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(description | Hum) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:

   Bayes' theorem for the probability \( P(CS | description) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]

   Where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description occurring:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(description) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.75)}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately:
\[
\boxed{0.9643}
\]
