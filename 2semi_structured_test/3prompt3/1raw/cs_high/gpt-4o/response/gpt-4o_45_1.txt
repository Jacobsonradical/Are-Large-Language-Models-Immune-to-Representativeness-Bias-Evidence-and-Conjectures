To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

We already know:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since Jason's interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, lack of interest in drawing or writing) seem to align more closely with those typically associated with computer science professors, we can assume that:

- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low.

Without exact values, but assuming a reasonable differential based on the given description, let's hypothesize:

- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{(0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)} \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, calculating the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
