To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence to give a posterior probability.

Here's how we can calculate it:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability of being a computer science professor (CS): P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - The probability of being a humanities professor (H): P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood** (given the description):
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of someone with Jason's traits being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on Jason's description:
     - Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging.
     - Does not enjoy drawing or writing.
   
   Given these traits, it's more likely that Jason would be a computer science professor. Let's assume some reasonable likelihoods:
   - P(description | CS): Higher, say around 0.9
   - P(description | H): Lower, say around 0.1

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
   
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where:
   
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   
   Plugging in the numbers:
   
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   So, the posterior probability is:
   
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
