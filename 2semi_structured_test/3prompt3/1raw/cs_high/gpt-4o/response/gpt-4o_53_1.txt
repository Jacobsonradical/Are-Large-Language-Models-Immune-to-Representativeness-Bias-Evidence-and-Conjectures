To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as Jason being a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's set up our priors:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the proportion of humanities professors in the sample.

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to determine:
- \( P(D | CS) \), the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \), the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Jason's interests and traits such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor. Therefore, we assume:

- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high because his description is typical for a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low because his description is less typical for a humanities professor.

Although exact values for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are not provided, we can reasonably assume the ratio between them is significantly larger than 1. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

We'll now calculate the normalizing factor \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
