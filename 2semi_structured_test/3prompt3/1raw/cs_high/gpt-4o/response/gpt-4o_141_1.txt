To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The problem provides us with the base rates (priors) and the likelihoods.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Base Rates (Priors):**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

   Given:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - And, \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): Probability of Jason's description, given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \): Probability of Jason's description, given that he is a humanities professor.

   Based on the description of Jason (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.), it seems more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Assigning reasonable likelihoods:
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood he is from CS given his interests).
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood he is from humanities given his interests).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Where the total probability of the description \( P(\text{Description}) \) is given by:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.8 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
   \]

### Conclusion
\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.923"}}}
\]
