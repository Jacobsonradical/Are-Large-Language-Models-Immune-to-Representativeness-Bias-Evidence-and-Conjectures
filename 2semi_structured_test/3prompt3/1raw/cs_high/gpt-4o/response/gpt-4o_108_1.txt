To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Rule. 

First, let's define some probabilities:

- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of observing the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability of observing the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \(P(D)\): The total probability of observing the description.

From the given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To determine \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), we use the description provided, noting that certain traits are more likely associated with computer science professors (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than with humanities professors.

Given the traits listed in Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding: This trait is highly indicative of a computer science professor.
- Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles: This is also more indicative of a computer science professor.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing: Again, this could lean more towards a computer science professor.

Since the description aligns more with traits typically associated with computer science professors, we can posit:
- \(P(D|CS) \approx 0.9\) (high probability because the description strongly matches a computer science professor)
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.1\) (low probability because the description does not strongly match a humanities professor)

Now applying Bayes' Rule to find \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We calculate \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
