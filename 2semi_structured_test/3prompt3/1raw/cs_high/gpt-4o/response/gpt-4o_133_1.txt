To update our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we need to account for the base rates and the evidence provided in the description.

First, we know the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

This means the prior probability (before looking at the description) that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider how likely Jason's description is under each hypothesis (computer science professor or humanities professor). The description includes elements like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- The probability of Jason meeting the described profile if he is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{Description} \mid CS)\)) is high, say 0.9.
- The probability of Jason meeting the described profile if he is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Description} \mid H)\)) is lower, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS \mid \text{Description})\)):
\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now we can compute \( P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \):
\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

So, the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

Thus, the answer would be:
```json
{"probability": "0.964"}
