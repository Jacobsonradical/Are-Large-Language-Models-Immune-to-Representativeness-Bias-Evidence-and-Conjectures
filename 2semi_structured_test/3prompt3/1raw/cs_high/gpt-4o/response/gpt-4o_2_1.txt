To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the information provided:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason has the described personality.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor).

Given that the description mentioned Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and has less interest in drawing or writing, we assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is likely high because these traits align more with computer science professors.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is likely low because these traits are less common among humanities professors.

Letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \]

Finally, we need the overall likelihood \( P(B) \), which is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
