To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the breakdown of the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science (CS): 
     \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Humanities:
     \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Based on the description, Jason is more likely to be a Computer Science professor. This is suggested by his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with CS than Humanities.

Let’s assume that the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is substantially higher than \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \). For the sake of estimation, let's assign probabilities based on this assumption:

   - Likelihood that a CS professor matches Jason's description: 
     \[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.8 \]
   - Likelihood that a Humanities professor matches Jason's description:
     \[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Now, we can plug this back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.923.

Answer:

{"probability": "0.923"}
