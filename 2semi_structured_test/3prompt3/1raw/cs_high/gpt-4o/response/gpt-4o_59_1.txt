To assess the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the necessary probabilities:

- \( P(\text{CS Prof}) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) \): Probability of the given description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities Prof}) \): Probability of the given description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \): Total probability of the description.

### Step 1: Calculate the prior probabilities
Given:
- 75 computer science professors,
- 25 humanities professors.

So, \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

### Step 2: Estimate the likelihoods
The description of Jason matches stereotypical traits more closely associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles, less interest in drawing/writing). Let's reasonably assume that:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities Prof}) = 0.2 \)

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \)
Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities Prof}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Prof}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem
\[ P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
