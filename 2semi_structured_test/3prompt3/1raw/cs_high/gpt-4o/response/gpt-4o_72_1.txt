Given that we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to solve this.

First, we'll identify the relevant information from the description of Jason:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These interests are generally more aligned with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which aligns less with humanities.

We can assume that the description of Jason is more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

We treat the probability of the description \( P(\text{Description}) \) as a normalizing constant, which ensures that the total probability sums to 1. For simplicity, we can focus on the relative likelihoods.

Since Jasonâ€™s description aligns much more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor, we can reasonably assign:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) to be relatively high
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) to be relatively low

Let's assume for simplicity that \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem without the exact normalizing constant:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \propto 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) \propto 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \approx \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

So, the answer is:
