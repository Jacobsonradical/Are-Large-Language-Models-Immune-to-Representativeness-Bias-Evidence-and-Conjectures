To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \) = Probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) = Probability that the description fits a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \) = Overall probability of the description, which can be computed as:
  \[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To simplify, let's consider the personality traits given and determine which subgroup (CS or Hum) Jason is more likely to belong to. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are stereotypically more aligned with the interests of computer science professors. Meanwhile, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more characteristic of humanities professors.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume:
- \( P(Desc | CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.8, given that Jason's interests align more closely with those of a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) is relatively low, say 0.2, given that Jason's interests do not align as well with a typical humanities professor.

Now, we calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(Desc) \):
\[ P(Desc) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.6) + (0.05) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.65 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

Answer: {"probability": "0.923"}
