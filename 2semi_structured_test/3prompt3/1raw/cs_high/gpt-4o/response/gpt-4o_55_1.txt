To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100 (75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities).
- The prior probability (base rate) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) = Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Marginal likelihood of Jason's description.
- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H | D) \) = Posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given his description.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that a professor is in humanities.

To simplify, note:
- Characteristics like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with not enjoying drawing or writing, are more indicative of being in computer science. 
- Descriptions point more strongly toward computer science than humanities.

For the sake of the model, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \): High likelihood that Jason, with his traits, is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \): Low likelihood that Jason, with his traits, is a humanities professor.

Now calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.923"}
