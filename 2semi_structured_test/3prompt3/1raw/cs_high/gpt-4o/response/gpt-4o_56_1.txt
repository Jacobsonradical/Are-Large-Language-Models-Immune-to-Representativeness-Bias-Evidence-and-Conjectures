To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to compare the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor based on the given description.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Prior probability**: The probability of each profession before considering the description.
   - Probability of being a computer science professor \((P(\text{CS}))\): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor \((P(\text{Hum}))\): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of observing the description given each profession.
   - Given Jason's interests and traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—with a noted lack of interest in drawing or writing—it is more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. This suggests that:
     - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is high.
     - \( P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \) is low.

For simplicity, let’s assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior probability** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the normalizing constant:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

Now, calculate the posterior:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Thus the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
