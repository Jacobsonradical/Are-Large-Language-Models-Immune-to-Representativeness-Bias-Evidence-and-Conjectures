To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

First, let's identify the necessary probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, which can be computed as follows:

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \)**: This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:

\[ P(A') = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: This is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging), it is reasonable to assume that these traits are more common among computer science professors. While we don't have exact rates, we will assume a higher value here. Let's estimate this as \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (a high likelihood given his interests).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \)**: This is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles (traits more aligned with computer science), we assume a lower likelihood here. Letâ€™s estimate this as \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \).

5. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the total probability of getting the description \( B \), which we can compute by considering both types of professors:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
