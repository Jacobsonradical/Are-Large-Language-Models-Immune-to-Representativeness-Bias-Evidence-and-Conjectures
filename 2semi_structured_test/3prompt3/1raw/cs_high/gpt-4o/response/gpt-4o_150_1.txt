To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' theorem. We start with the following information:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \): 
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group, \( P(H) \): 
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of observing the description of Jason given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \), and given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \). 
   By the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more indicative of a computer science background. Hence, we can assume:
   \[
   P(D | CS) \gg P(D | H)
   \]
   For simplicity, let's assume relative likelihoods:
   \[
   P(D | CS) = 0.9 \quad \text{and} \quad P(D | H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior probability**: The probability that Jason is from the computer science group given the description, \( P(CS | D) \):

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675
\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[
0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Finally:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

Therefore, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
