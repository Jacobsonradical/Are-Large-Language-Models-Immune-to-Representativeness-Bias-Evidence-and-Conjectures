To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a random professor is in computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The probability that a random professor is in the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Let's denote the following:
- \( P(CS | D) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(H | D) \) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since Jason's hobbies and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more strongly associated with a computer science professor, we can assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is high (let's approximate it to 0.9)
- \( P(D | H) \) is low (let's approximate it to 0.1)

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[ \boxed{"0.96"} \]
