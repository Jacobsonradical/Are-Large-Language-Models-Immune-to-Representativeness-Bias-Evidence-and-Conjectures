To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

First, we need to determine the priors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical activities for a computer science professor. Let's hypothesize:

- \( P(D|C) \): High probability, say, \( 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) \): Lower probability, say, \( 0.2 \)

We can now calculate the marginal probability \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
