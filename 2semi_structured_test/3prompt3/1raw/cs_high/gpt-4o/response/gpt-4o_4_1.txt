To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) occurring.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(CS) \) and the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \).

Based on the description:
- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more indicative of a computer science professor.
- Jogging is neutral and does not give us a clear indication.
- Not enjoying drawing or writing might be less indicative of a humanities professor.

Let's assume that:
\( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (Jason's description fits the profile of a computer science professor quite well).
\( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \) (Jason's description does not fit well with the profile of a humanities professor).

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Using the law of total probability, we calculate \( P(D) \) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
