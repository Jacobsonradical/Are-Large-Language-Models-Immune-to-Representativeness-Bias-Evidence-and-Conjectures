To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(A') \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):

\( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor, we might estimate this probability to be quite high, say 0.9.

\( P(B|A') \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor. Given that Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more characteristic of humanities professors, we might estimate this to be quite low, say 0.1.

Now, \( P(B) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
