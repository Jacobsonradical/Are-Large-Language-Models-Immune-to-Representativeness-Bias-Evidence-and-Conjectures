To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) given new evidence (the description of Jason).

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and the prior probability \( P(\text{Hum}) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- We need to find \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{evidence}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- We will use the description's evidence to estimate how likely a computer science professor and a humanities professor would have traits similar to Jason.

Let’s analyze the description:
- Jason’s traits include enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seem more aligned with a computer science background.
- He doesn’t enjoy drawing or writing, activities which may be more common in the humanities.

Based on this analysis, we can qualitatively estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{CS}) \): The probability of observing Jason's traits if he is a computer science professor is likely high.
- \( P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{Hum}) \): The probability of observing Jason's traits if he is a humanities professor is likely lower.

For simplicity, let’s assume rough estimates for these probabilities:
- \( P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{Hum}) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{evidence}) = \frac{P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{evidence})} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{evidence}) \):
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{evidence} \mid \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = 0.7 \]

Now, let’s calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{evidence}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{evidence}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{evidence}) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964, or 96.4%.
