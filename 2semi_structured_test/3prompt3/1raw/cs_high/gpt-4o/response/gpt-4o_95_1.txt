To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to evaluate the description of Jason and consider how likely it is that a computer science professor and a humanities professor would fit Jason's profile.
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These activities are more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) that a computer science professor fits Jason's description is high (e.g., 0.9) and the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) that a humanities professor fits Jason's description is low (e.g., 0.1).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - Where:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
     \]
     \[
     P(D) = 0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
     \]
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
     \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.964"}
\]
