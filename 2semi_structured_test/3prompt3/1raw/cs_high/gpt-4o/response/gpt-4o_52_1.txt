To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Here, we define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason's description.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(H) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of Jason's description given he is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

From Jason's description:
- He "enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles" which are highly indicative of a computer science professor.
- His specific activities ("coding, solving mathematical puzzles") are less likely to be associated with a humanities professor.

Based on the description and the typical characteristics associated with each field, we might estimate:
- \( P(D|C) \) as high, let's say 0.9, because his interests and activities are closely aligned with computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) as low, let's say 0.1, because his interests and activities are not strongly aligned with humanities.

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' formula:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
