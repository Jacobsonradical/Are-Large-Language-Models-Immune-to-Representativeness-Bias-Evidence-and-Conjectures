To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is an approach that updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

### Step-by-Step Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science (CS): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Humanities: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Probability that a CS professor fits Jason's description: \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\).
   - Probability that a Humanities professor fits Jason's description: \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})\).

Since we don't have exact probabilities, we need to make educated guesses based on the description:
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles and dislikes writing and drawing, which aligns more with traits common amongst CS professors.
   
   For the sake of argument, let's estimate:
   - \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx 0.9\) (very high probability since traits match).
   - \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1\) (very low probability since traits do not match).

3. **Posterior Probability (using Bayes' theorem):**

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

So:

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Hence the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
