To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. The evidence given in the description seems to align more with a computer science professor than a humanities professor, but we need to formalize this with probabilities.

We start by noting the prior probabilities:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor \((P(CS))\) = 0.75 (75 out of 100 professors are in computer science)
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor \((P(H))\) = 0.25 (25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities)

Next, we consider the likelihood of his description given his field:
- Given the traits and interests (coding, mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assume these are more common among computer science professors. Let’s assume \(P(D|CS)\) (the probability of the traits given he is a CS professor) is 0.9.
- Conversely, the same traits are less likely for humanities professors. Let’s assume \(P(D|H)\) (the probability of the traits given he is a humanities professor) is 0.1.

We then apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To find \(P(D)\), the overall probability of the description, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643. 

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
