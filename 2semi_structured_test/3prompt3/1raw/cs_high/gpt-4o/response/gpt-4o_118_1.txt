To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to consider:

1. The prior probability of being a computer science professor (CS) or humanities professor (H).
2. The likelihood of the description given Jason's field.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability of being a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability of being a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) = likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) = likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) = overall probability of the description

Given the sample sizes:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, let's consider the description of Jason. The description strongly suggests traits associated with computer scienceâ€”enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These traits are generally more common in computer science professors than humanities professors.

Assuming:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.9 (high likelihood due to coding and mathematical puzzles being more common in CS).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low, say 0.1 (low likelihood due to the described traits being less common in humanities).

We now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
