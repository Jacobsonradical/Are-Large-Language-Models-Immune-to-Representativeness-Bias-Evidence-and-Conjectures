To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's set up the problem with the given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Given the description of Jason, we need to update our prior probability based on the evidence from the description. We can use the following steps:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))

Based on the description of Jason, it seems more likely that a computer science professor would enjoy coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging while not enjoying drawing or writing. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that:

- \(P(D|CS)\) is relatively high.
- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively low.

Since the exact values of \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are not provided, let's assign arbitrary values based on the description being more consistent with a computer science professor. For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\) (since Jason's traits align well with typical computer science interests)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\) (since Jason's traits do not align well with humanities interests)

3. **Normalization factor:** \(P(D)\)
   - \(P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\)
   - \(P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)\)
   - \(P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7\)

4. **Posterior probability:** Using Bayes' theorem
   - \(P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\)
   - \(P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}\)
   - \(P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964\)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
