To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the given evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that any given professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

The prior probabilities can be calculated based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

\( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description of Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and given he doesnâ€™t enjoy drawing or writing, it is more representative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

To simplify:
- Let \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood the description fits a computer science professor).
- Let \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood the description fits a humanities professor).

Now substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = 0.964
\]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

So, the formatted answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
