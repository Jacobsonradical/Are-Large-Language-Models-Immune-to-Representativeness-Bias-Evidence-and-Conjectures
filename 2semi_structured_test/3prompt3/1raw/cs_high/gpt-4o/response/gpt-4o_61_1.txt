To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given of Jason.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A_{H}) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are likelier activities for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing also aligns more with a computer science professor's profile.

So, we have:
\[ P(B|A_{CS}) >> P(B|A_{H}) \]

Let's assume these likelihoods generically for more explicit illustrative purposes. If we assume:
\[ P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|A_{H}) = 0.1 \]

Now, to find the overall probability of Jason's description \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS})P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H})P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS})P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.964"\} \]
