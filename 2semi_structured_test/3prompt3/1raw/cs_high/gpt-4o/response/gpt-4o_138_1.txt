Given the details provided, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

We start with the base rate or prior probability. The study sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

- The prior probability, \( P(CS) \), that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The prior probability, \( P(Hum) \), that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the description given for Jason and assess the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | Hum) \). 

The description includes attributes typically associated more with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than with humanities professors. This suggests that \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) would likely be higher than \( P(\text{Description} | Hum) \).

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(\text{Description} | Hum) = 0.1 \), reflecting a strong skew towards identifying with a computer science professor:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our prior to get the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
