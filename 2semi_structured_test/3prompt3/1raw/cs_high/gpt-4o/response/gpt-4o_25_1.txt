To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probability: \( P(A) \)**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Probability of Description \( P(B|A) \)**
   - Given the information, Jason's interests and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing) strongly suggest he fits the profile of a computer science professor.
   - Let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) is high, say 0.95. This high value indicates that the description is very likely if Jason is indeed a computer science professor.
   - Otherwise, for a humanities professor, these traits might be less common.
   - For the sake of this calculation, let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \) is low, say 0.1.

3. **Overall Probability of Description: \( P(B) \)**
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
   - Substituting the values:
   \[ P(B) = (0.95 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.7125 + 0.025 = 0.7375 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.75}{0.7375} \]
   \[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.7125}{0.7375} \approx 0.9661 \]

Therefore,
