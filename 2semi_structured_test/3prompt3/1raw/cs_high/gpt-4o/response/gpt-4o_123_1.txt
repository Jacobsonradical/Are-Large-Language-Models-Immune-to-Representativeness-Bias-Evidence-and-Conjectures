To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the description provided.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor \( P(\text{CS}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

   - The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor \( P(\text{Humanities}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \):
     Given Jason's interests (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) which align strongly with typical computer science activities, we can assume that this likelihood is higher. While we don't have exact numerical values from the study, let's estimate \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) as 0.9.

   - The likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \):
     Given that Jason's interests do not align as closely with the common activities in humanities, let's estimate that this likelihood is lower, say 0.1.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   So,
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.964"}}
