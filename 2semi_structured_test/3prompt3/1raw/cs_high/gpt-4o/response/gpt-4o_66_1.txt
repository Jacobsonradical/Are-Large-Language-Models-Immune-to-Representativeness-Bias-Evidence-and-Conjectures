To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps and the information we need:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
    - Prior probability \( P(A) \) for computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
    - Prior probability \( P(B) \) for humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
    - We need the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor \( P(D \mid CS) \) and fitting a humanities professor \( P(D \mid H) \).
    - Jason's description involves coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities expected to be more common among computer science professors. Let's assume:
        - \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.9 \) (reflecting a high likelihood that such traits are found in a computer science professor)
        - \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (reflecting a low likelihood that such traits are found in a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
    \[
    P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
    \]

    Plugging in the values:
    \[
    P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS \mid D) = \frac{27}{28} \approx 0.9643
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Here is the answer in the required format:
