To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's use the following notation:

- Let \( CS \) denote Jason being a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) denote Jason being a humanities professor.
- The probability we are seeking is \( P(CS|D) \), where \( D \) is the description given.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D|CS) \): The likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
   - \( P(D|H) \): The likelihood that a humanities professor fits Jasonâ€™s description.

Given Jason's interests and traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. Let's cautiously assume:
   \[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \] (high, but not absolute, due to other possible interests)
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \] (low, based on the traits misaligning with typical humanities interests)

3. **Posterior probability**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.964"}
