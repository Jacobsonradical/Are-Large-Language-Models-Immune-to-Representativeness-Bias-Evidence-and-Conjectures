To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the base rate and the likelihood of the description fitting either group.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and for humanities \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we analyze the likelihood of the description fitting each group. Given Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is reasonable to assume that these characteristics are more likely associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors.

Let's assume:
- The likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) is relatively high. For simplicity, let's estimate this as 0.9.
- The likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) is relatively low. For simplicity, let's estimate this as 0.1.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \times P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.964.
