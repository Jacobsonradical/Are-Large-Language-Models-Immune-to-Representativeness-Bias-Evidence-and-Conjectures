To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to consider the characteristics described and how likely they are to belong to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these traits strongly align with computer science. However, we need to frame this in a credible way without specific numerical data. For illustration let's suppose:
     - Probability of having Jason's traits given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \), is higher, say 0.9.
     - Probability of having Jason's traits given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \), is lower, say 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Bayes' theorem formula: 
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
     \]
     Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05} = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
     \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
