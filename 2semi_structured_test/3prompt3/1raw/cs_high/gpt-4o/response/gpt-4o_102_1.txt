To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant terms:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
3. \( P(D|CS) \): The probability that the description matches Jason if he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \): The probability that the description matches Jason if he is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(CS|D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
6. \( P(H|D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, considering the description of Jason, he enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These traits are more typical of someone in the computer science field than in the humanities field. Hence, we can assume:

- \( P(D|CS) \): This is high because Jason's traits align well with those of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): This is comparatively low because Jason's traits do not align as well with those of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.964.
