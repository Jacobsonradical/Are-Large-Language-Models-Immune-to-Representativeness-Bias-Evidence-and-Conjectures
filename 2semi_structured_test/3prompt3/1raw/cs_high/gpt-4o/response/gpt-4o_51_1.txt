To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided for Jason.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. This is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason has the given description given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the information, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science. Hence, let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason has the given description given that he is a humanities professor. Since the description is not typical of a humanities professor, we could assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

Lastly, we calculate the normalizing constant \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643. 

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
