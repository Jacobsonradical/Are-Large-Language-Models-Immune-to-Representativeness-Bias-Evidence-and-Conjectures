To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided, let's utilize Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**: This is the initial degree of belief before considering the description of Jason. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \quad \text{and} \quad P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods**: These are the probabilities of observing Jason's description assuming he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Jason's interests and traits (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with the profile of a computer science professor.

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

   Given the stereotypical traits, let's hypothesize:
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes’ theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   The total probability of the description \( P(\text{description}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, plug these into Bayes’ theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.9643"}
\]
