To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The information provided in the description suggests a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability**: 
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the prior probability \(P(CS)\) of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \(P(H)\) of a randomly chosen professor being from humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - We need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor \(P(D|CS)\) and a humanities professor \(P(D|H)\).
   - Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and the fact that he enjoys activities typical of computer science professors, we can assume \(P(D|CS)\) is high.
   - Jason's traits do not strongly fit the common profile of a humanities professor; hence, \(P(D|H)\) might be lower.

While exact numbers for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are not given, we can assume the following based on logical reasoning:

- \(P(D|CS) \approx 0.9\) (high because the description fits a computer science professor well)
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.1\) (low because the description fits a humanities professor poorly)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\) is calculated as follows:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the assumed values:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is expressed as:

\{
   "probability": "0.964"
\}
