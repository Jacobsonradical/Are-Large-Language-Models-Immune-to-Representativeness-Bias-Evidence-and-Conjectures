To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Let's identify these components:

1. **Prior Probability - \( P(A) \):**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability - \( P(A^c) \):**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood - \( P(B|A) \):**
   - The probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description. Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of this description being a computer science professor is high. For the sake of calculation, let's assign a high probability, say 0.9.

4. **Likelihood - \( P(B|A^c) \):**
   - The probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description. Given Jason's interests and the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more aligned with the humanities, let's assign this a lower probability, say 0.1.

5. **Marginal Probability - \( P(B) \):**
   - The overall probability of the description.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately \( 0.9643 \).

The answer is:
