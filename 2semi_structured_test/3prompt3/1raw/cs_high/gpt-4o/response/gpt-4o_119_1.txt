First, let’s consider the base rates for the two groups of professors:

- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let’s consider the description of Jason:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (seems more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor)
- Highly creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing (creativity without an affinity for writing might lean towards technical creativity rather than humanities, reinforcing the computer science inclination)

Given the description, we should update our prior probabilities.

We now use Bayes' theorem to adjust the probabilities accordingly. However, without specific likelihood values, we will rely on the qualitative assessment of the description leaning more towards a computer science profile. Consequently, the likelihood ratio will favor computer science.

Given the description's alignment with traits common in computer science, it’s reasonable to significantly update our posterior towards computer science.

Therefore, an approximate posterior probability, respecting the qualitative tilt towards computer science while considering base rates, could be around:

{"probability": "0.9"}
