To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's denote the events as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given that:
- There are 75 computer science professors. 
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Let's assume for simplicity that the descriptions are equally likely to describe a computer science professor and a humanities professor, given their general attributes and the context of their jobs.

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, these activities align more closely with the typical interests of a computer science professor. However, we don't have exact probabilities for how likely these hobbies match each group, so we'll use an intuitive evaluation.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|E) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence (his description).
- \( P(E|C) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

If we assume \( P(E|C) \) is higher than \( P(E|H) \), given his interests more closely align with those of a computer science professor, we can estimate:

Let's consider:
\[ P(E|C) = 0.9 \quad (high probability Jason enjoys coding and puzzles) \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.1 \quad (low probability given less alignment with coding and puzzles) \]

The total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) is:
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|E) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Thus, the answer is: {"probability": "0.964"}
