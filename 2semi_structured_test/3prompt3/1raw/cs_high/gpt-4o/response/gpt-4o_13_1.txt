To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description matching Jason.

We need:
1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description.

Prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Given the description, Jason seems to exhibit characteristics (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) that are likely more common among computer science professors than among humanities professors.

Let’s assume an estimation:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \)

The total probability \( P(B) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
