To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Before using the theorem, let's establish the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the given description.

### Priors
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): 
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)):
  \[
  P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

### Likelihoods
Given the description of Jason, we need to evaluate the likelihood of obtaining such a personality description from a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

- Let \( P(D | CS) \) be the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(D | Hum) \) be the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Based on Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, as well as his disinterest in drawing and writing, it seems more likely that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without specific numerical values to assign to these likelihoods, we need to approximate them based on the described traits.

### Approximate Likelihoods
- \( P(D | CS) \) is reasonably high because coding, mathematical puzzles, and a disinterest in drawing and writing align with typical computer science interests.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) might be low, as these interests are less typical for someone in the humanities.

Letâ€™s assign approximate values based on qualitative judgment:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.1 \)

### Calculating Posterior Using Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \times P(Hum)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
