To determine the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor after reading his description, we'll use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]

Here, \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(B\) is the detailed description of Jason.

1. \(P(A)\): Prior probability Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(B|A)\): Likelihood of the description given he is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(B)\): Overall probability of the description.

We start with the base rates or prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- And \(P(A^C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (A^C means Jason is a humanities professor)

Next, we estimate the likelihoods:
- The description mentions interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) that are stereotypically more associated with computer science professors. 
- We can reasonably assign high probabilities to these interests among computer science professors and lower probabilities among humanities professors.

Given that:
- Likelihood \(P(B|A)\) is high, say approximately 0.8 (as the description fits a computer science professor well),
- And the likelihood \(P(B|A^C)\) is lower, say approximately 0.2 (since it is less likely but not impossible for a humanities professor to have these traits).

Now we need to find \(P(B)\):
\[P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C)\]
\[P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25\]
\[P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05\]
\[P(B) = 0.65\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}\]
\[P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.65}\]
\[P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65}\]
\[P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.923\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

Here is the answer in the required format:
