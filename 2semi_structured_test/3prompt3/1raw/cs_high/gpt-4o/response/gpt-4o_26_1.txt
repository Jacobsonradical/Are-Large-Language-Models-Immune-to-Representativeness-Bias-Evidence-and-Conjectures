To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): 
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): 
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihoods of a professor having Jason's characteristics given their field.

Given Jasonâ€™s interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, it's more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote:
   - \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS})\) as the likelihood of Jason having those characteristics if he is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{H})\) as the likelihood of Jason having those characteristics if he is a humanities professor.

Assuming these likelihoods reflect the traits described:
   - \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS})\) is high because coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more common in computer science.
   - \(P(\text{description} \mid \text{H})\) is lower because humanities professors are less likely to have the same characteristics.

For simplicity, assume:
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid \text{H}) = 0.1 
   \]

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   We need \(P(\text{description})\):
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
