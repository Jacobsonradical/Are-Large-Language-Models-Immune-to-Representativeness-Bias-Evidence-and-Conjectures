To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the normalization factor (total probability of the description).

First, we find the prior probabilities:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

For \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we need to consider the description's fit for a professor in each field. Given the description includes interest and activities strongly associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles), let's assume:

\[ P(D | C) \approx 0.9 \]  (High likelihood given those traits align well with a computer science professor)
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \]  (Low likelihood given those traits do not align well with a humanities professor)

Next, we find \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C | D) \):

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.9643 \) or about 96.43%.
