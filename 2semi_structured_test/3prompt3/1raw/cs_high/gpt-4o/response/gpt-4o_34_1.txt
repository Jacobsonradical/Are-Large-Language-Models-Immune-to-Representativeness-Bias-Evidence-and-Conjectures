To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This requires us to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description given each category.

First, let's establish our priors:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to assess the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging while not enjoying drawing or writing:

- The description seems more aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor, given his interests in coding and mathematical puzzles.

For the sake of argument, let's assign probabilities reflecting how well each category fits the description:

- Assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (high probability because the description strongly suggests computer science traits).
- Assume \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (low probability because the description does not strongly fit the typical humanities professor traits).

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

Numerator:
\[ 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675 \]

Denominator:
\[ 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725 \]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931, which can be provided in the requested format:
