To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood** (based on the description of Jason):
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with computer science professors.

For simplification, let's assume the likelihood ratios based on the description:
   - Likelihood for being a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) = 0.9 \)
   - Likelihood for being a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities Prof}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Normalizing Constant**:
   - This accounts for the total probability of the description.
   \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities Prof}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \)
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

4. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} â‰ˆ 0.964
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
