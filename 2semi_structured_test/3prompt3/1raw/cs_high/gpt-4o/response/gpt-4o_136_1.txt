To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event of having Jason's description.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. According to the problem, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \(P(\neg A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to estimate \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):

- \(P(B|A)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given his hobbies (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and lack of interest in drawing and writing, it seems likely that such a profile is more common among computer science professors. Let's assume \(P(B|A) = 0.8\).
- \(P(B|\neg A)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Given his lack of interest in drawing and writing, this might be less common among humanities professors. Let's assume \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.2\).

Finally, we need to calculate the overall probability of Jason's description \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{60}{65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.923.
