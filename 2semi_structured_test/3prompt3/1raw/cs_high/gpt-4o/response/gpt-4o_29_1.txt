To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS) in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**: This is the proportion of computer science professors among the total sample. There are 75 CS professors and 100 total professors.
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \)**: This is the proportion of humanities professors among the total sample.
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)**: This is the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description. Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is described in ways that align more with a typical profile of a CS professor, we can reasonably assume this likelihood is high. For the sake of the calculation, let's consider it to be quite high (e.g., 0.9).

4. **Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)**: This is the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description. Given the typical interests and traits described, it seems less likely, so let's consider a lower probability (e.g., 0.1).

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

We need to calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \), which is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Now we can plug in the values:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.964.
