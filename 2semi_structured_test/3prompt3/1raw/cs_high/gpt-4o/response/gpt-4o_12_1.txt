To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is represented as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

So, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(A^c) = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the description \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \).

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more typical activities for a computer science professor. Additionally, being creative but not liking drawing or writing also fits the computer science profile better than humanities.

We can assume:\[ P(B|A) = 0.90 \]

Considering these are less likely traits for a humanities professor, we might estimate:\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.10 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.90 \cdot 0.75) + (0.10 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.70 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{0.70} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability is:
