To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be written as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

Let's define the components step by step:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(CS)\))**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
   - So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Prior Probability (\(P(H)\))**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
   - So, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood (\(P(D|CS)\))**:
   - The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Given Jason’s interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume that he fits the profile of a computer science professor better than a humanities professor. For illustrative purposes, let's assume this probability is quite high, say 0.9.

4. **Likelihood (\(P(D|H)\))**:
   - The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
   - Since Jason's interests do not align well with typical interests commonly associated with humanities professors, we take this probability to be low, say 0.1.

5. **Total Probability (\(P(D)\))**:
   - The total probability of Jason’s description. This is computed using the law of total probability.
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - So, \( P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \).

Now we can compute the posterior using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:
