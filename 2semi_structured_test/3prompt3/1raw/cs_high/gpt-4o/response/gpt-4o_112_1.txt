To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to combine prior probabilities with the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, we consider the priors:
P(CS professor) = 75/100 = 0.75
P(Humanities professor) = 25/100 = 0.25

Given Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (traits more typical of computer science professors)
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing (traits less typical of humanities professors)

We assess the likelihood of the description fitting each type of professor:
P(description | CS professor) is expected to be high.
P(description | Humanities professor) is expected to be low.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})} \]

Given the qualitative nature, let's assign:
P(description | CS) ≈ 0.9 (high likelihood)
P(description | Humanities) ≈ 0.1 (low likelihood)

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) ≈ 0.964 \]

Hence, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
