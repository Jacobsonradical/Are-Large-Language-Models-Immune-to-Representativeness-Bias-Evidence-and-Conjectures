Let's approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning. We start with the prior probabilities and then update them based on the given description.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The number of computer science professors in the sample is 75.
   - The number of humanities professors in the sample is 25.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{75 + 25} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - To find the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) and given that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Description | H)), we consider the description provided.

Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious in a technical context) are more typically aligned with the characteristics of computer science professors. On the contrary, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are typically more associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood of him being in computer science.

For simplicity, let's assume:
   - P(Description | CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor).
   - P(Description | H) = 0.1 (low likelihood Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor).

3. **Bayesian Update**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our beliefs:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     - Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring in general.
     - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \)
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
     \]
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.

So the final answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.9643"}
