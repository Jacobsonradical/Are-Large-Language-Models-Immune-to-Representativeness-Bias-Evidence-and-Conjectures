To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Number of computer science professors \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Number of humanities professors \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) represents how likely we are to see Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
   - The likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) represents how likely we are to see Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing, it is more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Therefore, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \). 

However, we don't have exact numerical values for the likelihoods, so we will consider a qualitative judgment that these traits are more typical for computer science professors. Let's assume a hypothetical ratio to reflect this judgment:

- Let's assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- Let's assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Normalization Constant:**
   - The normalization constant is the total probability of the description:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
     \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \approx 0.964
     \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
