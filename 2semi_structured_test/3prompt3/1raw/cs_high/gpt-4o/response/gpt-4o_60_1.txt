To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H) is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Let’s denote the evidence (description of Jason) as \( E \).

Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(CS|E) \), we also need \( P(E|CS) \), the probability of the evidence given that the professor is from computer science, and \( P(E|H) \), the probability of the evidence given that the professor is from the humanities.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. Additionally, the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing further strengthens this assumption.

While we do not have exact probabilities for \( P(E|CS) \) and \( P(E|H) \), we can make an educated guess based on the description. It is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of a computer science professor fitting this description is quite high compared to a humanities professor.

Let’s estimate:
- \( P(E|CS) \) is high, say around 0.9.
- \( P(E|H) \) is low, say around 0.2.

Now, we need to find \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the evidence. This is given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we can now calculate \( P(CS|E) \):

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|E) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
