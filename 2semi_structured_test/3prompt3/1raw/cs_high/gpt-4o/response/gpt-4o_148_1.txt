To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

We need to determine a few components for Bayes' theorem:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

### Step 1: Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
Similarly,
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \))
Based on the description, Jason seems to exhibit traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). We will assume:

- \( P(B|A) \) = 0.9 (high likelihood of the description being for a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = 0.1 (low likelihood of the description being for a humanities professor)

### Step 3: Total Probability (\( P(B) \))
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

### Step 4: Posterior Probability (\( P(A|B) \))
Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.9643.
