To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to compute:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason fitting the description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason fitting the description under both scenarios (computer science and humanities).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, we have:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)** (where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor):
\[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
Based on Jason's description (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, dislikes drawing or writing), it seems more aligned with traits typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles). Therefore, let's assume a higher likelihood. We need to give it a solid but hypothetical figure since exact numbers aren't provided. Suppose:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
If Jason were a humanities professor, his description (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing) is less probable. Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \]

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.
