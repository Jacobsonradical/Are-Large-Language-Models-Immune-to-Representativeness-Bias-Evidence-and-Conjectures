To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description is given.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) (Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(A^c) \) (Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We need to calculate:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) can be assumed to be quite high due to the traits like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and the absence of interest in drawing or writing, which are stereotypically associated with a computer science professor. Let's assume this likelihood to be quite high, say 0.9.

The likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \) might be lower because Jason's interests and described behavior do not align as closely with typical humanities professors. Let's assume this likelihood to be lower, say 0.3.

To apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.3 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.075 = 0.75 \]

Now calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.9"}
