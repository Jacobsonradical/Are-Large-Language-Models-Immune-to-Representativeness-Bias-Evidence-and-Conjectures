To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probability \( P(A) \):

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{H}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's assess the likelihoods \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \). Based on the given description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more stereotypical interests of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description, it is reasonable to assume:

- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \), the likelihood of the description given he is a computer science professor, is high. Let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \), the likelihood of the description given he is a humanities professor, is low. Let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) = 0.1 \).

Now, calculate \( P(B) \), the marginal likelihood of the description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{H}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964, or 96.4%.

Therefore, the answer is:
