To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability:** This is the initial probability before taking the new evidence into account.
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(75/100 = 0.75\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(25/100 = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:** These are the probabilities of the given evidence being observed given each hypothesis.
   - Probability that a computer science professor has the traits described (\(P(description | CS)\))
   - Probability that a humanities professor has the traits described (\(P(description | H)\))

Let's make an informed assumption about the likelihoods based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science professors.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities perhaps more closely associated with humanities professors.

Assume:
- \(P(description | CS) = 0.8\) (i.e., most people with these traits are in computer science)
- \(P(description | H) = 0.1\) (i.e., only a few people with these traits are in humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability:** Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

First, calculate \(P(description)\):
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.625 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = 0.96 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.96"} \]
