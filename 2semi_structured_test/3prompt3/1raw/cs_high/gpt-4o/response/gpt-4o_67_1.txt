To determine the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Desc|CS) \) is the probability of the given description if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Desc|Hum) \) is the probability of the given description if the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Desc) \) is the total probability of getting the description.

We start by calculating the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Similarly, \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to estimate \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|Hum) \). The description suggests a higher likelihood of being in computer science based on characteristics such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of computer science professors.

Without exact values, let's assume reasonable estimates:
- \( P(Desc|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood because the traits fit well).
- \( P(Desc|Hum) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood because the traits fit less well).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|Desc) \):

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
0.8 \cdot 0.75 = 0.6
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Finally:

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.923"}}}
\]
