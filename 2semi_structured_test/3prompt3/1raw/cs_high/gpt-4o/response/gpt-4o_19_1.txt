To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The number of computer science professors (\(C\)) = 75
   - The number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 25
   - Total number of professors = 100 
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to evaluate the likelihood of observing the description given the professor's discipline.
   - The description mentions specific traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are significantly more common in computer science than humanities.
   - Although the exact probabilities are not provided, we can reasonably assume that these traits (coding, mathematical puzzles) are much more likely to be associated with a computer science professor.

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem,
   \[
   P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P(C | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
   - \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Given the strong alignment of Jason's traits with computer science characteristics, \( P(D | C) \) is likely very high, while \( P(D | H) \) would be relatively low.

For simplicity, let's say:
- \( P(D | C) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \)

Therefore, \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | C) P(C) + P(D | H) P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
