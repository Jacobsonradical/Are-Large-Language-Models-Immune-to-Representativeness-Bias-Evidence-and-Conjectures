To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to calculate the likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science or humanities. 

The description suggests:
1. Enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—typically more associated with computer science.
2. Aversion to drawing and writing—activities more commonly associated with humanities.

Given these evaluation points, we can assume that Jason's personality description is much more likely to correlate with a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) = 0.75 \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Likelihood of Jason's description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Likelihood of Jason's description given a humanities professor.

Given the strong correlation of Jason's description (coding, math puzzles) with computer science, we can reasonably assume \( P(D|CS) \) is high, let's assign a probability of 0.95. Since Jason does not enjoy activities generally more connected with humanities, \( P(D|H) \) will be low. Let's assume it is 0.1.

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
\( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring, which can be expanded as:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
P(D) = (0.95 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.7125 + 0.025
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.7375
\]

Now, compute \( P(CS|D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.75}{0.7375}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7125}{0.7375}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) \approx 0.9661
\]

Thus, Jason being a computer science professor is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.9661"}
\]
