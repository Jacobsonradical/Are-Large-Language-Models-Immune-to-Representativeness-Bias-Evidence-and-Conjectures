Given the description and the base rates in the sample, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.

Here is a straightforward application of Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) P(CS)}{P(D | CS) P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) P(Humanities)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Humanities) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Humanities) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected professor is a humanities professor.

From the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \) and \( P(Humanities) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).

Next, let's consider \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Humanities) \). The given traits (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing) seem more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For the purpose of this calculation, let's make a rough estimation:
- Let's assume \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (since the traits are very common among CS professors).
- Let's assume \( P(D | Humanities) \approx 0.2 \) (since the traits are uncommon among humanities professors).

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{(0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25)}
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05}
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725}
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) \approx 0.93
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.93.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.93"}
