To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \` = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to assess how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

   Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging:
   - It's highly likely that Jason is a computer science professor given these interests.
   - It's less likely, though possible, that Jason is a humanities professor with these interests.

   Let's suppose the likelihoods are:
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \) = 0.9 (as the interests align well with computer science)
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \` = 0.1 (as the interests are less likely for a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Let's calculate it:

   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now:
   
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
