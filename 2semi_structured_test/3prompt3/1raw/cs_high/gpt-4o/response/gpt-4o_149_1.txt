Given the initial distribution of the sample, we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors. This gives us prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) as follows:

\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We are given a description of Jason, which provides specific attributes. To find the posterior probability \( P(CS | \text{description}) \), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

However, we do not have exact data for \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \). We need to estimate these based on the attributes mentioned.

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is described as "not enjoying drawing or writing," these traits are more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, we can reasonably estimate that \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) is higher than \( P(\text{description} | H) \).

Let's suppose our estimates for these probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
