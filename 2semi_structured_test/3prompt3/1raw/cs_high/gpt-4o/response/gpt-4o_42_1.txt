To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
  
Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to compute the posterior probability \( P(C | D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be written using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more associated with the humanities, it is reasonable to assume that:
- \( P(D | C) \) is much higher than \( P(D | H) \).

For simplicity, let's assign some reasonable probabilities:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood for computer scientists).
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood for humanities professors).

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C | D) = 0.96 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.96"}
