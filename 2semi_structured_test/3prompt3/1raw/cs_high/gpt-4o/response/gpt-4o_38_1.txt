To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a Humanities professor.

Given:
- The prior probability \( P(C) \), which represents the initial likelihood Jason is a Computer Science professor, is based on the proportion of Computer Science professors in the sample. There are 75 Computer Science professors out of 100 total professors, so:
  \[
  P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

- The prior probability \( P(H) \), representing the initial likelihood Jason is a Humanities professor, is based on the proportion of Humanities professors in the sample. There are 25 Humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so:
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the likelihood of the given description \( D \) given that Jason is a CS professor (\( P(D|C) \)) and the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).

Based on the description, Jason's interests and attributes (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing) seem to align more closely with typical characteristics associated with a Computer Science professor than a Humanities professor. Letâ€™s make an educated assumption:
- Assume \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (very likely characteristics of a CS professor)
- Assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (not very likely characteristics of a Humanities professor)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
\]

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{675}{700} = \frac{135}{140}
\]

\[
P(C|D) \approx 0.964
\]

Based on these calculations, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.964.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
