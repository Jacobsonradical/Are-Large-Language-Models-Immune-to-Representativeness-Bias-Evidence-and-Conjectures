To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do it step by step:

First, we define:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | Hum) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's set up the information we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we are trying to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given the field, we'll assume that traits like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disliking drawing and writing are more strongly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (since the description fits well with a computer science profile)
- \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.1 \) (since the description fits poorly with a humanities profile)

Now, we need \( P(D) \), which is the total probability of the description across both groups:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964. Hereâ€™s the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.964"}
