To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Rule. Let's break down the information:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   The description of Jason seems to align more closely with typical computer science traits (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles, conservative, careful). We will denote the likelihood of this description given a computer science professor as \(P(D|CS)\) and for a humanities professor as \(P(D|H)\).

   Let's assign reasonable estimates for these likelihoods:
   - \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\).
   - \(P(D|H) = 0.3\) (since humanities professors are less likely to have interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation (Using Bayes' Rule):**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.3 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
