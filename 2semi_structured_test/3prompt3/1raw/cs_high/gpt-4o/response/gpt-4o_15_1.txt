Based on the description given, it seems more likely that Jason could be one of the computer science professors due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically more aligned with the interests and skills of someone in that field. However, we need to consider the prior probabilities given the initial sample sizes.

We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description, the characteristics such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators suggesting computer science, so we can utilize Bayesian probabilities to refine our estimate.

However, without exact likelihood values for the description fitting each group, we will lean heavily on qualitative assessment and the prior probabilities.

Given that the description fits exceptionally well with typical traits of a computer science professor, we can reasonably estimate a higher posterior probability for Jason being in the computer science sample.

Estimating subjectively but rigorously, let's denote Jason with \( D \).

\[ P(CS|D) \propto P(D|CS) \times P(CS) \]
\[ P(H|D) \propto P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) is high due to relevant traits and \( P(D|H) \) is relatively lower (painting and writing indicators), the posterior for \( P(CS|D) \) would be higher than 0.75 due to the affirming indicators in the description.

A reasonable posterior probability estimate:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9 \]

Therefore:
