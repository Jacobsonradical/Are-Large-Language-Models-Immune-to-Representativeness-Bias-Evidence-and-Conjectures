To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, we can follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

We start with prior probabilities:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)): 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider how likely this description is for professors in each field. Given the description, Jason's interests and traits seem to align more with typical attributes of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) rather than with humanities (drawing, writing).

Let's denote:
- P(D | CS) as the probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science,
- P(D | H) as the probability of the description given that Jason is in the humanities.

We might reasonably estimate:
- P(D | CS): high (say 0.9), since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
- P(D | H): low (say 0.1), since Jason does not enjoy writing or drawing.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, is approximately 0.9643. 

Formatted answer:
