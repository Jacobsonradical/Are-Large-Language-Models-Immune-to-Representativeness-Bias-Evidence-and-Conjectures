To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We aim to calculate \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): The probability of the description.

First, let's calculate \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

Thus:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):

Based on the description, Jason likes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing. These attributes are more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Hence, we can reasonably assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \).

Assume:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \] (coding and mathematical puzzles are strongly indicative)
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \] (less likely to enjoy coding or solving mathematical puzzles)

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \boxed{0.96} \]
