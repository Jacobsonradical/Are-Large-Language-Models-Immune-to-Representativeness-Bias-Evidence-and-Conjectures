Let's break down the information given to calculate the posterior probability:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - We need to calculate the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor and a humanities professor.
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor \( P(Desc | CS) \) and the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor \( P(Desc | Hum) \).
   - Jason's description includes enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more characteristic of computer science professors.
   - His creative aspect might slightly lean towards the humanities, but his dislike for drawing or writing is not a typical humanities trait. Given this, we could assume:
     - \( P(Desc | CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.9.
     - \( P(Desc | Hum) \) is relatively low, say 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
     \]
   - \( P(Desc) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be calculated as:
     \[
     P(Desc) = (P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)) + (P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum))
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     P(Desc) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725
     \]
   - Now, calculate the posterior probability:
     \[
     P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
     \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
