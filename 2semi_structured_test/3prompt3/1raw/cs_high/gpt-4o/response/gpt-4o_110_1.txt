Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, we can use Bayesian reasoning to arrive at a posterior probability.

First, let's restate the problem:
- There are 75 professors in computer science and 25 professors in humanities.
- Total number of professors: 100.

We want to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P( \text{CS} ) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P( \text{H} ) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
3. \( P( D | \text{CS} ) \): The likelihood of the description matching a computer science professor.
4. \( P( D | \text{H} ) \): The likelihood of the description matching a humanities professor.
5. \( P( D ) \): The overall probability of the description.

Calculations:
1. The prior probabilities:
   \[ P( \text{CS} ) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P( \text{H} ) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Likely, Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles align more commonly with computer science professors, implying \( P( D | \text{CS} ) \) is higher than \( P( D | \text{H} ) \). Let's make an educated guess:
   \[ P( D | \text{CS} ) = 0.9 \]
   \[ P( D | \text{H} ) = 0.1 \]

3. Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[ P( \text{CS} | D ) = \frac{P( D | \text{CS} ) \cdot P( \text{CS} )}{P( D | \text{CS} ) \cdot P( \text{CS} ) + P( D | \text{H} ) \cdot P( \text{H} )} \]

Substitute:
   \[ P( \text{CS} | D ) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
   \[ P( \text{CS} | D ) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
   \[ P( \text{CS} | D ) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
   \[ P( \text{CS} | D ) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

{"probability": "0.96"}
