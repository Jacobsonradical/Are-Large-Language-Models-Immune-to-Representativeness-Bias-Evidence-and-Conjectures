To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is defined as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's assign and calculate each term:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(A') \)**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   Let's assume (based on the description) that Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) are much more likely among computer science professors than humanities professors. Let’s assume relatively higher values for this:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \] (highly indicative of a computer science professor)

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \)**:
   Similarly, let's assume that Jason’s interests and traits are much less likely among humanities professors:
   \[ P(B|A') = 0.1 \] (not very likely for a humanities professor)

5. **Overall probability of the description \( P(B) \)**:
   This is given by the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.6) + (0.025) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.625 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.96 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.96"}
