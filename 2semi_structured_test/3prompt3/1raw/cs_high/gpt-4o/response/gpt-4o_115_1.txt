To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence provided by Jason's description.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**: The proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability (P(A'))**: The proportion of humanities professors in the sample.
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A))**: The probability of observing Jason's characteristics given that he is a computer science professor.
4. **Complementary Likelihood (P(B|A'))**: The probability of observing Jason's characteristics given that he is a humanities professor.
  
Given Jason's description, it suggests characteristics more closely aligned with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). These descriptions are less typical for a humanities professor.

For the sake of this calculation, assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|A') = 0.1 \]

5. **Normalization Constant (P(B))**: The total probability of observing the evidence \( B \),

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A') \times P(A') \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

6. **Posterior Probability (P(A|B))**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.
