To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( J \) as the description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|J) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)} \]

First, let's define the prior probabilities based on the sample:

- \( P(C) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(J|C) \) and \( P(J|H) \):

- \( P(J|C) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given that Jason likes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align well with typical activities and traits of a computer scientist, we could assume this probability is relatively high, though it's an estimation.

- \( P(J|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. His description does not strongly align with common activities and traits associated with humanities professors, so we could assume this probability is relatively low, though it's also an estimation.

Let's assume \( P(J|C) \approx 0.8 \) and \( P(J|H) \approx 0.2 \) for the sake of calculation. 

Now we need to calculate \( P(J) \):

\[ P(J) = P(J|C) \cdot P(C) + P(J|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(J) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(J) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(J) = 0.65 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)} \]
\[ P(C|J) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|J) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|J) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923 (92.3%).

Therefore, the answer can be formatted as:

{"probability": "0.923"}
