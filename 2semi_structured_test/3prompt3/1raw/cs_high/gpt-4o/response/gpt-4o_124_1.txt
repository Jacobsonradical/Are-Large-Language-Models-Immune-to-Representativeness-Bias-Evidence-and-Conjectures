To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem, which involves the prior probabilities and the likelihood of observing the given description if Jason is in one group versus the other. 

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): Likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of observing the description.

Given the study setup: 
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) based on the description. Jason's interests and characteristics align more closely with those of a typical computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, being conservative and careful), and less so with a humanities professor. Therefore, we make an educated guess:

- Let's assume \( P(D | CS) \) is high, say 0.9.
- Let's assume \( P(D | H) \) is low, say 0.2. 

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Where,
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.

In the required format:
