To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is defined as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

We have the following initial information:
- Total number of professors is \( 100 \).
- Number of computer science professors (\( N_{CS} \)) is \( 75 \).
- Number of humanities professors (\( N_{H} \)) is \( 25 \).

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{N_{CS}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A') = \frac{N_{H}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \), the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively.

Given Jason's description, it seems that his interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and being conservative, careful, and ambitious) align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

We can make an assumption based on this alignment:
- Let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \), reflecting a strong alignment with computer science traits.
- Let's assume \( P(B|A') \approx 0.2 \), reflecting a weaker alignment with humanities traits.

The total probability \( P(B) \) of Jason's description is then:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.923 \).

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.923"}
