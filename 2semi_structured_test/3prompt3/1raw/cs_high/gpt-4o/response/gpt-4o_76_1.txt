To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we want to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

1. \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
4. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

For the likelihoods, based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, typical traits of a computer science professor.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, making it less likely he is a humanities professor.

While these are subjective assessments, we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability that a computer science professor fits the description)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability that a humanities professor fits the description)

Now, calculate \( P(D) \) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
