To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood that his description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor from the sample.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description being observed.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The given description.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25

Thus:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Our goal is to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

Considering the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which might be more common among computer science professors. Additionally, Jason doesn’t enjoy drawing or writing, which could be less common in humanities. Therefore, we might reasonably assert:
- \( P(B|A) \text{ (likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor)} \) is relatively high.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \text{ (likelihood of the description if Jason is a humanities professor)} \) is relatively low.

For simplicity, let's assume that:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) 

Then we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Now applying Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
