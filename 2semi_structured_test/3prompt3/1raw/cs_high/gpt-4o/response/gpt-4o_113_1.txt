To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The proportion of computer science professors in the total sample: 75 out of 100.
   - The proportion of humanities professors in the total sample: 25 out of 100.

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common activities among computer science professors.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - We need the probabilities of someone with Jason's profile being in each group. Without exact data on the personality profiles in each discipline from the study, we make a reasonable assumption that Jasonâ€™s profile is significantly more likely in computer science.

   Let's assume:
   \[
   P(description | CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(description | Hum) = 0.1
   \]

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   Where,
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | Hum) * P(Hum)
   \]

   Substituting in the known values:
   \[
   P(description) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   So, 
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.964"}
```
