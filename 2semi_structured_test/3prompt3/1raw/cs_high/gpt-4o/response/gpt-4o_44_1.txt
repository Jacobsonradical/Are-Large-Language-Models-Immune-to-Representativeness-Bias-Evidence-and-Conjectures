To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to compare the likelihood of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 
   - Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more closely related to computer science, we can hypothesize that these traits are more likely for a CS professor.

Let's assume the likelihoods based on the description:
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor \( P(D | CS) \).
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(D | H) \).

We can assign these likelihoods as follows:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood he is a CS professor given the specific interests)
   - \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood he is a humanities professor given the specific interests)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) = \( P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \).

So:

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, we can calculate:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
