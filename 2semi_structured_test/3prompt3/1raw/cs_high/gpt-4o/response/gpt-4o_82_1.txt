To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant data and how we can calculate it:

- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- Prior probability (P(CS)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability (P(Hum)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely Jason's description would be for each group. Given Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not into drawing or writing), it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. However, without specific probabilities, we'll use Bayesian updating with a subjective probability based on this description:

1. Let's denote P(D | CS) as the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
2. Let's denote P(D | Hum) as the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since the description seems much more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we'll assign reasonable subjective probability values as:

- P(D | CS) might be around 0.9 (high likelihood of having these traits in CS professors).
- P(D | Hum) might be around 0.1 (low likelihood of having these traits in humanities professors).

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

We can expand \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now,

\[
P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.964
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.96"}
\]
