To answer this question, we use Bayes' theorem to update our probability estimate based on the available information. The steps involve determining the prior probabilities and likelihoods, then calculating the posterior probability.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Let \( D \) be the description given.
   - The likelihood of the description for a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)).
   - The likelihood of the description for a humanities professor (\( P(D|Hum) \)).

Given the description, it is more characteristic of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.). We can reasonably assume that:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is high, say close to 1.
   - \( P(D|Hum) \) is lower, because humanities professors are less likely to engage in activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
   - \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem: \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - We need \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

- Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
