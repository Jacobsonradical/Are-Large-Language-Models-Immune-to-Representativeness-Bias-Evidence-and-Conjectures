To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

We are interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Prior probabilities: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, all of which are more stereotypically associated with computer science. Given this, we can make a subjective estimate that these hobbies and traits are substantially more common among computer science professors than among humanities professors. 

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Then we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
