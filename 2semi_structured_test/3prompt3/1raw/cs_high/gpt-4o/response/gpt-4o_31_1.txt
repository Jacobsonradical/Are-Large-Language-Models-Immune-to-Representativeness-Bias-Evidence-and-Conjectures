To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we assume that the description given has a higher likelihood of corresponding to a computer science professor than to a humanities professor, given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. We can estimate the likelihoods based on this assumption.

Without exact figures, letâ€™s assume the following:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \]  (90% chance the description fits a computer science professor)
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \]  (20% chance the description fits a humanities professor)

The total probability of the description is:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.725 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.93 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.93.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:
