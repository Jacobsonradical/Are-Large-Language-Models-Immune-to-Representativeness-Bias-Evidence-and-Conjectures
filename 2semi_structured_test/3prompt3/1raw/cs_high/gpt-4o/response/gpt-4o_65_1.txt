To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:
- Prior probability (P(CS)): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
- Prior probability (P(Hum)): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

Next, we consider the likelihoods based on Jason's description:
- Likelihood (P(Description|CS)): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- Likelihood (P(Description|Hum)): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.

We intuitively assess these likelihoods based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors. Therefore, we can reasonably assign a higher likelihood to P(Description|CS).
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more common hobbies among humanities professors. Thus, P(Description|Hum) would be lower.

However, estimating the exact numerical values for these likelihoods can be subjective. Suppose we set:
- P(Description|CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood based on his interests and traits)
- P(Description|Hum) = 0.1 (low likelihood based on his lack of interest in typical humanities hobbies)

Using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability P(CS|Description):

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where \( P(Description) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

Now, plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.9643"} \]
