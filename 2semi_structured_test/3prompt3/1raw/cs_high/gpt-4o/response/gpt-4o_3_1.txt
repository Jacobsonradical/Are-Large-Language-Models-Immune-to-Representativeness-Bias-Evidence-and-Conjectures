To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood \( P(X|CS) \) that the description fits a computer science professor and \( P(X|Hum) \) that the description fits a humanities professor.
   - Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it's reasonable to assume these traits are more likely among computer science professors than humanities professors.

   Thus, we can assume:
   \[
   P(X|CS) > P(X|Hum)
   \]
   Given that Jason doesn’t enjoy drawing or writing and is highly creative, conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, these traits still seem more aligned with a computer science professor.

3. **Applying Bayes’ Theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS|X) = \frac{P(X|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(X)}
   \]

   - Since \( P(X) \) is the same for both being a computer science professor and a humanities professor, and considering that \( P(CS) \) significantly outweighs \( P(Hum) \):
   
   \[
   P(X) = P(X|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(X|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

4. **Assumptions**:
   To simplify, let's assume:
   \[
   P(X|CS) = 0.8 \quad \text{(high probability Jason's traits fit CS)}
   \]
   \[
   P(X|Hum) = 0.2 \quad \text{(lower probability Jason’s traits fit Hum)}
   \]

5. **Calculate Posterior**:
   \[
   P(CS|X) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{0.6}{0.65}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{6}{6.5}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{60}{65} = \frac{12}{13} \approx 0.923
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(CS|X) \) that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.923"}}}
\]
