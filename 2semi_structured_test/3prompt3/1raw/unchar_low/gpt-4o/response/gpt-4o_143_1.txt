To update your prior with the given description and calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, you can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Based on the provided description, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason having these traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(Description | CS)\)), and the likelihood of having these traits given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(Description | Hum)\)).

If we assume that the description provided is equally likely for both groups of professors (since we don't have specific details otherwise):
- \(P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)\)

This means the description does not provide additional information to distinguish between the two groups beyond the prior probabilities. Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since \(P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)\), the denominator \(P(Description)\) will cancel out similarly for both groups, thus:

\[ P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
