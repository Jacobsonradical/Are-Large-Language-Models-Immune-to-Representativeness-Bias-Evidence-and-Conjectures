To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is formalized as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A (Jason being a computer science professor) given B (the provided description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A â€” essentially, the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A (Jason being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B (the provided description, irrespective of discipline).

First, let's estimate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
- The prior probability of Jason being from CS: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability of Jason being from H: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we assume that the description of high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation are equally likely across both disciplines due to lack of specific distinguishing characteristics mentioned that are unique to either field. Therefore:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \approx 1 \)

Now, compute the marginal probability \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Finally, let's compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
