To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the initial probabilities and use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's determine the base rates (prior probabilities):

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a Computer Science (CS) professor: \(P(CS)\)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a Humanities professor: \(P(Hum)\)

Since there are 25 CS professors and 75 Humanities professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we use the given description to update our beliefs. However, the description provided does not offer specific traits that are unique to the Computer Science professors compared to Humanities professors. It is a generic description that could apply equally to both groups. Since the description does not provide additional differentiation between the two groups, our posterior probabilities will be consistent with the priors.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]
