To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason’s description.

Let's assign the values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
    - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
    - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
    - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
    - Therefore, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. ** \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
    - Without further specific information indicating bias in the description toward one field or the other, we could assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \). However, given this is a Bayesian approach and we're trying to update our beliefs, we might initially assume these probabilities are even since the descriptions could suit both fields generally.

4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
    - \( P(B) = (P(B|A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)) \).

Since we assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \) and don't have specific biases, let’s say \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = p \). Then \( P(B) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = p \cdot P(A) + p \cdot P(\neg A) = p \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = p \cdot 1 = p \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, based on the given information and assuming the description is equally likely for both fields:
