The description provided for Jason does not include details specifically pointing to a discipline such as computer science or humanities. Therefore, we need to rely on the base rates provided to infer the posterior probability.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description of Jason is neutral and does not provide any specific evidence to favor one group over the other, we should rely purely on the base rates.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
