To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine our prior probabilities, \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):
- \( P(A) \) (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability that Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, let's think about the probability of the description \( P(B) \). This would be influenced equally by both groups if we assume no bias in the description assignment process.

Given no specific information suggesting that the description is more likely for one group over the other, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \). 

Therefore, both \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) have equal probabilities. Since we have equal likelihoods, our posterior probability for Jason being from computer science simplifies to the prior:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
