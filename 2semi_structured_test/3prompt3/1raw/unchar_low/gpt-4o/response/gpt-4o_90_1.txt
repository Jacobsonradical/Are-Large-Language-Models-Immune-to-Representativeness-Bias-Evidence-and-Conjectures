To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In this case, we need to find:
P(CS | Description)

Where:
- P(CS | Description) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- P(Description | CS) is the probability of Jason's description being given if he is a computer science professor.
- P(CS) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which we derive from the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
- P(Description) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

We can start by setting up the known probabilities:
1. P(CS) = 0.25 (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors).
2. P(H) = 0.75 (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors).

The descriptions provided do not specify differences between the academics in a way that aligns distinctly with either computer science or humanities. Therefore, assuming that the likelihood of Jason fitting this description is roughly the same for both fields, we can intuitively say P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H), which implies that the specific description doesn't bias towards either field.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since \(P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | H)\):
\[
P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given our assumption \(P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H)\), let's call this equal probability \(P(Description | CS) = x\). Therefore:
\[
P(Description) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 = x (0.25 + 0.75) = x
\]

Thus:
\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25
\]

So the probability remains unchanged:
