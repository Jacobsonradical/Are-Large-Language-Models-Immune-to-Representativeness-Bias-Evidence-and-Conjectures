To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor and given he is a humanities professor. However, without specific quantitative descriptors, we'll assume that Jason's characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are equally likely to be found among both groups based on the question details.

Given that Jason's traits are equally likely for both groups, the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HUM) \) are the same.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) normalizes the probability and \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \), and imagining the likelihoods are equal, they cancel out:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HUM)} \cdot \frac{P(D | CS)}{P(D | CS) + P(D | HUM)} \]

Thus, we arrive at:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25 (or 25%).
