To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'll employ Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break it down:

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a random professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a random professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of the given description.

First, we calculate the priors based on the sample distribution:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since the provided description is fairly generic and does not significantly favor one discipline over the other, we can make the simplifying assumption that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \) and if \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), it simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
