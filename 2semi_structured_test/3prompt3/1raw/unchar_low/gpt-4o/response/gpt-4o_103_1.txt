To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event of observing Jason's description.

We aim to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's establish the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)) and the prior probability that a professor is a humanities professor (\( P(A^c) \)):

- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of observing the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)) and the likelihood of observing the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(B|A^c) \)). Without any additional specific information distinguishing descriptions between the two groups, we can assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are approximately equal because the study targeted successful and well-liked professors in both fields.

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), we can simplify Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

This reduces to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
