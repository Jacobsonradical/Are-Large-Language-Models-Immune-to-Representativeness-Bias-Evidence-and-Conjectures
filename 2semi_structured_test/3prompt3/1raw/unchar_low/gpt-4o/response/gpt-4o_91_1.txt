To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our terms:

- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Probability of the description being provided ("high ability and strong motivation; well-liked by his colleagues").
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor).

We have no specific information on \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) other than implying that the given description fits equally well for both groups of professors. This implies that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are approximately equivalent.

Hence, we can assume:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given the symmetry of the problem, we can estimate \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \). Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) simplifies essentially to the prior probability, as the description does not change our initial probabilities.

So,

\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
