To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Here’s the information broken down:

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \): Probability of a professor being from computer science.
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \): Probability of a professor being from the humanities.

Posterior probability is given by:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of description \( D \).

Since we don’t have specific information about \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D) \), we assume that descriptions are equally likely among both groups. Hence:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \]

Thus by Bayes’ theorem and given the priors:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
