To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to carefully analyze the given data using Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
    - The description provided can apply to professors in both fields.
    - Since the description doesn't give specific criteria that strongly differentiate between the two fields, we will assume the likelihood of the description being drawn randomly from either group is equally plausible.

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
    - Bayes' Theorem formula:
      \[
      P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
      \]
    - Similarly,
      \[
      P(H \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})}
      \]

4. **Equal Likelihood Assumption:**
    - Since Jason’s description seems equally likely to be from both groups, we assume \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \).

5. **Normalizing Factor (Total Probability of Description):**
    \[
    P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
    \]

    Given that \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \), we can denote it by \( P(\text{description}^*) \).

6. **Calculating Posterior Probability:**
    \[
    P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}^*) \cdot 0.25}{P(\text{description}^*) \cdot 0.25 + P(\text{description}^*) \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
