To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) of being a computer science professor is: \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor is: \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To proceed, we need to assume that the description provided is equally likely to fit a computer science professor or a humanities professor because there is no specific information in the description leaning towards one field over the other. Hence, we can assume that:

- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

Given this assumption, the overall probability \( P(B) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 \]

So, \( P(A|B) \) is simplified to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

But given that P(A) + P(Â¬A) equals 1, we just need the initial priors:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]

Thus, \( P(A|B) = 0.25 \).

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
