Given the initial setup and the presented description, we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

So the prior probability (P(A)) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), and the prior probability (P(B)) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now, Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
Where:
- \( P(A|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(D\)).
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of the description (\(D\)) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description (\(D\)).

\( P(D) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]

To proceed, we need to estimate:
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

Since the description of Jason is quite generic and could easily fit both computer science and humanities professors, let's assume:
\[ P(D|A) \approx P(D|B) \]

For simplicity, without additional specific information that differentiates computer science from humanities professors based on the description provided, let's assume:
\[ P(D|A) = P(D|B) \]

Given this assumption, we then have:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = P(D|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(B)) = P(D|A) \cdot 1 = P(D|A) \]

Therefore, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A)} = P(A) \]

Given our prior probability \( P(A) \) is 0.25, this would mean:
\[ P(A|D) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
