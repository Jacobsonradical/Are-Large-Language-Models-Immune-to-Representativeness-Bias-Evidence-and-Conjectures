To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that we have no additional information about the description's likelihood with respect to each group, we assume \( P(B|A) \) and the corresponding probability for the humanities group are equal. Thus, these terms cancel out.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A_{CS}|B) \) can be simplified to:

\[ P(Jason\, is\, in\, CS|Description) = \frac{P(Jason\, is\, in\, CS)}{P(Jason\, is\, in\, CS) + P(Jason\, is\, in\, Humanities)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
