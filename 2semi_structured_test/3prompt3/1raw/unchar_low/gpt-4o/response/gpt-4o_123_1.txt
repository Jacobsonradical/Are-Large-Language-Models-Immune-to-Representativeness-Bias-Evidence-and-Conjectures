To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( A \) represents the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) represents the description provided.

First, we need the prior probability \( P(A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 100 professors in total.

So, 
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the prior probability of not being a computer science professor (being a humanities professor, \( \neg A \)):
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- There are 100 professors in total.

So, 
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we assume that the descriptions provided do not favor one group over the other since we have no information that suggests a bias:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of observing the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (1 \times 0.25) + (1 \times 0.75) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
