To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We can start by considering the priors and the problem's context.

First, let's look at the prior probabilities:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability (prior) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability (prior) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, the description given ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation") is quite general and doesn't strongly differentiate between the two groups based on the provided information.

Without additional specific data distinguishing traits more common in one group over the other, we can assume that the probability of Jason having the given description is similar across both groups. Therefore, the likelihood ratio here does not provide further differentiation.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given the equal likelihood of the description across both sets, we simplify as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
