To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, we need to define the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A') \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Therefore, \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \).

Second, we need to consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given that we use Jason's high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation as part of the description and assuming these traits are equally likely among computer science and humanities professors, we can simplify by assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \). This would imply the likelihood ratio is neutral (i.e., one), but we may still rely on the prior ratio for the posterior calculation.

Finally, we obtain \( P(B) \) as a normalization factor, but it doesn't affect the ratio when \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \). We directly use the prior:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A')} = P(A) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is equivalent to the prior \( P(A) \):

\[ \boxed{P(A|B) = 0.25} \]

Thus, Jason has a 0.25 probability of being one of the computer science professors.
