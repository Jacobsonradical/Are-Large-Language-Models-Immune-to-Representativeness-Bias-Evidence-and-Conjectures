To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We start with the base rates for the two groups and then update these with any specific evidence provided in the description of Jason. 

The base rates (prior probabilities) are as follows:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the description of Jason, we do not have specific evidence that particularly distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we will use the base rates without additional weighting.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since we do not have differentiated evidence from the description, we'll assume that:

\[ P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \]

Thus:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

So the answer is: {"probability": "0.25"}
