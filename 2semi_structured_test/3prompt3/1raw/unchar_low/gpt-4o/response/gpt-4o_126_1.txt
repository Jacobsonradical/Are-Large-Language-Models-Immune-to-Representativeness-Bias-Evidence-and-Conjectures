To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the prior probabilities:**
   - Let \( P(\text{CS}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: 
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Let \( P(\text{H}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Assess the likelihood:**
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
   - Since we don't have detailed evidence to distinguish between CS and humanities professors based solely on the given description, we can assume our best guess for the likelihoods without any strong bias. For simplicity, let us assume the likelihoods are equally plausible, i.e.:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H})
     \]

3. **Calculate the marginal likelihood:**
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
   \]
   
4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Given that \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \), let's denote both likelihoood terms as \( P(\text{Description}) \), which cancel each other out in the equation.

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
   \]
   Given our prior probabilities, this simplifies as:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Given the assumptions and likelihoods, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
