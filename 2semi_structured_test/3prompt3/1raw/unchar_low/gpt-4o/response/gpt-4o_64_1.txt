Let's start by calculating the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, we need to update these probabilities. The description must be assessed for how likely it is to describe a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Without specific details that indicate a strong association with either group from the possession of personality traits alone (i.e., "high ability", "strong motivation", "well-liked"), we assume the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either group. This can be understood as a situation where the likelihood functions \( P(Description|CS) \) and \( P(Description|H) \) are roughly equal.

If \( P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|H) \), then by Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Given our assumption:

\[ P(CS|Description) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Because \( P(Description) \) is common to both computer science and humanities and usually results in normalization over \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(CS|Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(Jason \text{ is a CS professor}) \) remains essentially as the prior:

{"probability": "0.25"}
