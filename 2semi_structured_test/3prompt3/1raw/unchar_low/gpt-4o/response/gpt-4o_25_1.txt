To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, we have:
- Prior probabilities: The probability that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) and that a randomly chosen person is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{HU})\)).
- Evidence: The description of Jason.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor from the sample, \(P(\text{CS})\): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor from the sample, \(P(\text{HU})\): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we have no specific evidence that distinguishes the description provided as more likely for computer science professors versus humanities professors, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups. This means the likelihoods \(P(E|\text{CS})\) and \(P(E|\text{HU})\) are equal. Let's denote this common probability by \(P(E)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

Since \(P(E|\text{CS})\) and \(P(E|\text{HU})\) are equal, they cancel out in the ratio and we simplify to just using the priors:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{HU})} \cdot \frac{P(E|\text{CS})}{P(E|\text{HU})}
\]

Given that \(P(E|\text{CS}) = P(E|\text{HU})\), the denominator normalizes to 1, so:

\[
P(\text{CS}|E) = P(\text{CS})
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the prior probability:
