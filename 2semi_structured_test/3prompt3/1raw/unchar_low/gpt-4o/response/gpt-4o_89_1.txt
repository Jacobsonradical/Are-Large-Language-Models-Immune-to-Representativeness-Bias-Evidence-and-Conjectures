Let's use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, let's define what we know:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of getting such a description.

We need the following probabilities:
1. **Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor** (\( P(A) \)):
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor** (\( P(A^c) \)): 
   This would be the complement of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   \[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

3. **Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor** (\( P(B|A) \)): 
   We assume the description is equally likely for both groups unless additional data suggests otherwise.

4. **Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor** (\( P(B|A^c) \)):
   Similarly, we assume equal likelihood unless indicated otherwise.

Since the description is fairly neutral and doesn't seem to strongly favor either group, we'll assume that \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \).

Putting it all together:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

Because \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), they cancel out:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \{\ "probability": \ "0.25"\ \} \]

In conclusion, based on the given description and assuming no significant differences in the likelihood of these neutral traits between the groups, the probability is 0.25.
