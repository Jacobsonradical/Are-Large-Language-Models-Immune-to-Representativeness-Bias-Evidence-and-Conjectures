Based on the information given, we can use Bayes' Theorem to help determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the described personality traits.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we need to calculate:
- \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability that Jason has the described personality traits given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): the total probability that Jason has the described personality traits.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We don't have specific information about \( P(B|A) \) or \( P(B|humanities) \), so we'll generally assume the traits described are equally likely for both groups of professors unless evidence suggests otherwise. This means:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|humanities) \]
Therefore, since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|humanities) \) are approximately equal, the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx P(A) \]

So, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.25.
