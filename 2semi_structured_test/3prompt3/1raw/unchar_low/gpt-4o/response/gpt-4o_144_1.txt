Let's use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description. 

We need to find \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Here are the steps:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that someone is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that someone is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \): The probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \): The probability of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have specific information on how likely the description is for computer science professors vs. humanities professors, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups for simplicity. Therefore, we assume:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \).

3. **Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   However, given the assumption that the description is equally likely for both groups, we can simplify the formula as follows:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided information is 0.25.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
