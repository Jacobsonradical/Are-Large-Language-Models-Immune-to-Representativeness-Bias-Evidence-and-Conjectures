To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. In this context, let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).

However, the description provided does not give specific details that would favor one group over the other regarding the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked). Thus, without additional specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors based on these traits, the likelihoods are not distinguishable from each other given the information.

In such a scenario, where the description does not provide differential information, the prior probabilities (the proportions of each group in the sample) are the best estimate we can use for the posterior probabilities:

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
