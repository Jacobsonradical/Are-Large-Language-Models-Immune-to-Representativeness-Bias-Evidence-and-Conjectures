Considering the problem, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. This is a straightforward application of Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- **Number of computer science professors (C)**: 25
- **Number of humanities professors (H)**: 75

From the initial description, there is no specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors. Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, we apply the principle of indifference, assuming each professor in the sample is equally likely.

The total number of professors is:
\[ N = C + H = 25 + 75 = 100 \]

The probability \( P(C) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{C}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, based on the random selection and lack of distinguishing features:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

So the answer is:
```
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
