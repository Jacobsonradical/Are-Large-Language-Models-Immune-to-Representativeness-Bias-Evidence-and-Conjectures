In this problem, you're essentially being asked to update your prior belief using the description provided.

Let's start with the base rates (priors). Out of the total 100 professors:
- 25 are computer science professors
- 75 are humanities professors

From the description provided, there's no specific information that would heavily sway us towards one group over the other based on typical stereotypes or information about their fields. So we essentially have to work with the given base rates.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided about Jason is fairly neutral and does not give strong evidence that would significantly change these base rates. High ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation are traits that could be equally likely in both computer science and humanities professors in this context.

So, without further distinguishing characteristics, the posterior probability remains largely based on the prior probability.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \(0.25\).
