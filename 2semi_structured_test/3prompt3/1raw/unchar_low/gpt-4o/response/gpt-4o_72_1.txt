To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 \)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \)).

Since the description is chosen at random and no explicit bias is given in the description towards either field (computer science or humanities), let's assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \). This simplifies calculations because it implies that the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equal and cancel each other out in Bayes' theorem.

### Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.75} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{0.25} \]
