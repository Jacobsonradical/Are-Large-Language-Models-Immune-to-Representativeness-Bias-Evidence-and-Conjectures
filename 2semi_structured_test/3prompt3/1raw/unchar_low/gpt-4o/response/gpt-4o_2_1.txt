To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the information we have:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science (CS) professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

We need to find the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation").

Bayesâ€™ theorem formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor (which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description (regardless of field).

Assuming that the descriptions are equally likely to occur across both groups of professors (since specific probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are not given):

- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \)
- \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \)

Given:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \)
- \( P(A) = 0.25 \) 
- \( P(A^c) = 0.75 \)

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A^c) \cdot 0.75 \]
Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

So,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, under these assumptions:
\[
\text{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
