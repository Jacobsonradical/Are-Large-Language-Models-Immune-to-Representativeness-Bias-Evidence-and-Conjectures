To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Given:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description needs to be assessed for relevance (a priori, without specific traits strongly pointing towards one group or the other).

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

First, calculate the prior probability:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Without specific additional information to adjust relative likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \)—we might assume they are similar unless the description specifically gives a hint differentiating the two disciplines—we can simplify by considering the priors as the decision factor.

Thus, assuming:

\[
P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)
\]

Then:

\[
P(CS|D) \approx P(CS) = 0.25
\]

So, the posterior probability is:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
