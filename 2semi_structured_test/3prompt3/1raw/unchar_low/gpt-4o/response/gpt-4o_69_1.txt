To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the terms and data:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
3. \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we do not have specific information indicating that Jason's description is more likely to be attributed to either group, we'll assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{ P(D) } \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) are equal and cancel each other out:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ 
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\} 
\]

So the final answer is:

\{
"probability": "0.25"
\}
