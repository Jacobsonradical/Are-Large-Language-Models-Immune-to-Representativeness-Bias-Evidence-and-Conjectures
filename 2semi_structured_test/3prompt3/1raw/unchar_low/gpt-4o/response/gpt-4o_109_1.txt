To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to calculating it:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
    - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
    - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood**:
    The problem states that Jason is "known for his high ability and strong motivation" and is "well-liked by his colleagues." To make the problem solvable, we can consider the likelihood of these traits given the type of professor. Without specific likelihood values for computer science versus humanities professors, we usually assume these traits are equally likely across both groups unless stated otherwise.

3. **Bayesian Inference**:
    Since no specific evidence suggests these traits are more or less likely in either group, we assume them to be equally likely. Hence, the likelihood ratios cancel out:

    \[
    P(\text{Traits} | CS) \approx P(\text{Traits} | Hum)
    \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
    \[
    P(CS | \text{Traits}) = \frac{P(\text{Traits} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Traits})}
    \]

    Given that \( P(\text{Traits}) \) would be the same for both groups, the equation simplifies to the prior probabilities. So,

    \[
    P(CS | \text{Traits}) = P(CS) = 0.25
    \]

Therefore, 

\{
    "probability": "0.25"
\}
