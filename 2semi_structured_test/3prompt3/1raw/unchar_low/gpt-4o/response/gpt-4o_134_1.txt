To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is from the computer science group.
- \( B \) is the description given (i.e., known traits of Jason).

Let's define our parameters:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors total, so:
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is:
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of having this description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | \neg A) \) is the likelihood of having this description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that we don't have additional differentiating information specific to the description, we assume that the likelihood of having these traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is not significantly different between the two groups. Therefore, we assume the likelihoods are the same:
  \[ P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \]

Then,
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | \neg A) * P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \) are likely similar, they cancel out in the computation, so we focus on the priors.

Thus:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A) * P(B | A)}{P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | \neg A) * P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
