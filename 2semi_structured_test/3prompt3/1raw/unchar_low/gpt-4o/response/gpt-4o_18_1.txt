To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to utilize Bayes' Theorem. Here's the information we have:

- \( P(CS) = \text{prior probability that a professor is in computer science} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \text{prior probability that a professor is in the humanities} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given that this description applies equally well to both groups (we assume independence of traits for simplicity and due to lack of distinguishing information), the likelihood ratio \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | Hum) \) are assumed to be equivalent.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Since \( P(description) \) is a normalizing constant and \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \), it simplifies the calculations, and we can use the priors directly.

Thus:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not particularly distinguish Jason as being more likely to belong to either group, the posterior probability remains influenced primarily by the priors.

Hence, we have:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
