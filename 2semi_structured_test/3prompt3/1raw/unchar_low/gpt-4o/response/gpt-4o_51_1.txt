To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayesian reasoning. Here's the process, broken down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor at random from the sample population is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Similarly, the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(Humanities) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   The description of Jason provided includes traits like high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation. To proceed accurately, one would ideally need data on the likelihood of such a description being chosen if one were sampled from the CS vs. humanities groups. In absence of specific probabilities, we assume the description is equally likely among CS and humanities professors:
   \[
   P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | Humanities)
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
   Bayes' theorem helps us update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   However, \( P(Description) \) can be expanded with the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)
   \]
   Given our assumption that \( P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | Humanities) \), the equation simplifies due to the cancellation in the numerator and denominator terms. Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
