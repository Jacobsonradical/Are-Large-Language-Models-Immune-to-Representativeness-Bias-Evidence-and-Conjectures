To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's set up the problem with the given information:

- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
- There are 25 computer science (CS) professors and 75 humanities professors.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.

Denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) as the probability of the description given the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Description | Hum) \) as the probability of the description given the professor is from humanities.

Since the description given does not specifically favor either field (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation), we might reasonably assume that \( P(Description | CS) \) is similar to \( P(Description | Hum) \). For simplicity, letâ€™s set \( P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since \( P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum) \), the denominator \( P(Description) \) does not affect the relative probabilities, so we can focus on the priors:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Substituting in the given probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
