First, let us apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

In this context:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason has the given description.
- We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

We can estimate the prior probabilities from the sample:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Given that the description is quite generic and does not imply any particular field-specific traits, itâ€™s reasonable to assume that the probability of receiving such a description is about the same across both groups. Therefore, we can set \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Since these probabilities are equal, \( P(B) \) can be simplified using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal, they cancel out in the ratio:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{0.25} \]
