Given the scenario, first we need to calculate the prior probabilities for a professor being from computer science or the humanities. We know there are 100 professors, with 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities. 

So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the description provided. The description states that Jason is well-liked, has a high ability, and strong motivation, which are traits that could be common to successful professors in both fields. Without further information that clearly differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors, we treat the likelihood of this description fitting a professor from either field as equal.

Given that the description does not provide evidence favoring one discipline over the other, we apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to update our posterior probability, but this actually does not change the prior probabilities in this specific scenario.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
