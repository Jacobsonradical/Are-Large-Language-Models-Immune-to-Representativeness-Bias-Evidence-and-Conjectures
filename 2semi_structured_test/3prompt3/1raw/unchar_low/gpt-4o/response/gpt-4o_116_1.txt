To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is: 
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(HUM)) is: 
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason doesn't provide enough specific information to significantly update these priors based on unique traits more likely linked to one group over the other. Therefore, the evidence provided (the description) doesn't seem to favor one group more than the other. So, the likelihood values for both categories given his described traits would be similar.

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains approximately the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS| \text{description}) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
