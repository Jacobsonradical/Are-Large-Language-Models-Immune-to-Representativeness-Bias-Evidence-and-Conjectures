To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event A given event B.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B given event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event B.

Here:
- Let event \( A \) be "Jason is a computer science professor."
- Let event \( B \) be "Jason has the described personality."

We need to determine the values for each of these probabilities.

First, the prior probability \( P(A) \):
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Similarly, the prior probability for a humanities professor \( P(A') \):
- There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
- So, \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):
- Since the description is general and doesn't specify any trait that clearly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume that the likelihood of getting this type of description is not drastically different between the two groups. 

Assuming equal likelihood:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \approx \beta \).

So, the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = \beta \cdot 0.25 + \beta \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = \beta \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = \beta \]

Therefore, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{\beta \cdot 0.25}{\beta} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.25"} \]
