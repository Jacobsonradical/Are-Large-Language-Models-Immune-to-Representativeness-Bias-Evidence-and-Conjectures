To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description {Jason's description}.

We are given:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Assuming no other information, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, the description does not give us explicit information that favors either group, but let's proceed with the calculation:

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \)

Since we don't have a reason to believe that the description is more likely for one group over the other,
we assume:
 
- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)

This results in:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
