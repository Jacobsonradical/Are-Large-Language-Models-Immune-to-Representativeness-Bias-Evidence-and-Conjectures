In order to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given that:
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\(P(HU)\)) is \(P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

The description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) does not seem to provide significant differentiating information about Jason's specific field, which suggests we should rely heavily on the base rates.

Using Bayes' Theorem, \(P(CS \mid D)\) and \(P(HU \mid D)\) can be evaluated, where \(D\) represents the description given. However, if we consider the description as equally likely across both groups, then we focus on the prior probabilities only:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid HU) \cdot P(HU)} \]

If the description \(D\) is equally likely for both groups, then \(P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid HU)\) and thus they cancel out in Bayes' Theorem formula, simplifying to:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HU)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So given our assumptions, the probability you are asking for remains:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{"0.25"} \]

So, our answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
