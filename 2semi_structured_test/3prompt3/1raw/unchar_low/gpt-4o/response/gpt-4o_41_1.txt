To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description among all professors.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

First, calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, calculate the prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is from the humanities:
\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description provided (high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation) is equally likely to apply to professors in both fields due to the lack of specific evidence that distinguishes one field's likelihood over the other:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \]

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \), and using normalization, it follows that:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \]

Since the likelihoods and priors are balanced, Bayes' theorem simplifies because \( P(B) \) cancels out the non-informative prior proportionally:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.25"}} \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
