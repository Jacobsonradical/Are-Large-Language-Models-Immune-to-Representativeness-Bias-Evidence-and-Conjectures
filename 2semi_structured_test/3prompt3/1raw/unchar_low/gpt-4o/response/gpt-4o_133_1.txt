To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

The initial, or prior, probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Conversely, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or description of Jason.

The posterior probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \) depends on how likely the description is given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \)) and the overall likelihood of the description (\( P(\text{Description}) \)).

Without specific probabilities or additional distinguishing information between the computer science and humanities professors in terms of their descriptions, it's reasonable to assume the description's likelihood is similar across both groups. This assumption simplifies our calculation, and the posterior probability would therefore be proportional to the prior probability.

As such, the posterior probability remains similar to the prior probability:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \approx P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, we can conclude with:
