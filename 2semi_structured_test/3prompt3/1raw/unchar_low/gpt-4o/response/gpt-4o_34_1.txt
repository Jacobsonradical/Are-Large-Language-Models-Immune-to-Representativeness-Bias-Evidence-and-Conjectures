To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Here's the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability of event A given evidence B.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of evidence B given that event A is true.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of event A.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of evidence B.

Let's define our events:
- Let \(A_1\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \(A_2\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to determine \(P(A_1|B)\), where B is the given description of Jason.

**Step 1: Calculate the prior probabilities \(P(A_1)\) and \(P(A_2)\):**
- \(P(A_1) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(A_2) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

**Step 2: Estimate the likelihood \(P(B|A_1)\) and \(P(B|A_2)\):**
- \(P(B|A_1)\): Assume high ability, strong motivation, and a positive reputation are not unusual among successful academics. We'll assume \(P(B|A_1) = c\).
- \(P(B|A_2)\): Similar to above, assume \(P(B|A_2) = c\).

Since the evidence B (the description of Jason) fits both types of professors equally well, we make a reasonable simplifying assumption:
\[ P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) \]

but without loss of generality, letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) = 1 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the overall probability \(P(B)\):**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

**Step 4: Apply Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is

\[ \text{{{"probability": "0.25"}}} \]
