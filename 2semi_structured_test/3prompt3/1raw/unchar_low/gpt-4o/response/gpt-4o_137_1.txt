To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's outline the steps:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The prior probability is the probability of selecting a computer science professor from the entire group of professors.
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, we are not given specific likelihoods of these descriptions for each group.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   According to Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since we don't have any specific likelihood information about the description matching one group more than the other and assuming they are equally likely (which is a strong assumption but necessary due to lack of information):

   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Given this assumption:

   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Since the likelihoods are equal, it simplifies to:

   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k
   \]

   Plugging in our assumptions:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the given information, is:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.25"}}
\]
