To solve this problem probabilistically, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for calculating the conditional probability. 

First, let's define the problem in terms of Bayes' theorem:

- \(P(CS | D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason's description across all samples.

We need to calculate \(P(CS | D)\).

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \(P(CS)\): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(H)\): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Given 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Assumption of equal likelihood:**
   Since no specific trait in Jason’s description skew distinctly towards one professor group over another based on the limited information given, we assume:
   \[
   P(D | CS) = P(D | H)
   \]

3. **Total probability \(P(D)\):**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Given \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\): let’s denote \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = L\)

   \[
   P(D) = L \cdot 0.25 + L \cdot 0.75 = L \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = L
   \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{L \cdot 0.25}{L} = 0.25
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is 0.25.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": 0.25}}
\]
