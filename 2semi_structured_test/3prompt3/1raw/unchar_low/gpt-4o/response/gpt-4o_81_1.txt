To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, let's lay out the information given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- Jason is randomly chosen from the 100 available descriptions.

Since Jason is chosen at random, the initial (prior) probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) or a humanities professor (\(P(H))\) is based on their proportions in the sample:
\[P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]
\[P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

We need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. For this, we would use:
\[P(CS | D)\]

Which can be computed using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\) is the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description happening.

Without specific probabilities for \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\), we assume these probabilities based on the general context, given that the descriptions are generic.

If we assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields, then:
\[P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\]

Thus, \(P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)\).
Since \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\), let this common probability be \(x\). Then:
\[P(D) = x \cdot P(CS) + x \cdot P(H) = x \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = x\]
This simplifies our Bayesian update to:
\[P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25\]

Thus, the initial probabilities without further evidence specifics still hold, and we get:
\[P(CS | D) = 0.25\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
