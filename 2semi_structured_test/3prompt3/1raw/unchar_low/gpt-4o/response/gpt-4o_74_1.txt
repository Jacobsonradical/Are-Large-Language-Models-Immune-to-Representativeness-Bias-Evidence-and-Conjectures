To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (this is what we need to find).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of getting the description.

First, let's determine the priors:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we don't have any detailed information to favor one field over the other based on the description alone ("high ability", "strong motivation", "well-liked"), we will assume that:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \]

Given this, the description does not provide us any additional differentiation between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is proportional to the respective prior probabilities.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \):

\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} 
\]

Given \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
