Sure, to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We need the following information:

1. **Base rates (prior probabilities)**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**: We need to assess how likely it is that a professor fitting Jason's description would come from either field. Since the description is general and doesn't favor one discipline over the other, we will assume that the likelihood is equal for both disciplines (P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum)).

Given this information and assuming equal likelihoods, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the base rates alone:

Using Bayes' theorem, where P(description) cancels out because it's equal for both disciplines:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given that P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum), 

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore,
