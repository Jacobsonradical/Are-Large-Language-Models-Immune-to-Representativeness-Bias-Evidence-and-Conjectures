To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we approach the problem:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is 25 out of 100: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is 75 out of 100: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - These are more difficult to quantify without concrete data from the personality descriptions, but we proceed assuming symmetric likelihoods since no specific distinguishing personality traits between the disciplines are provided in Jason's description.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Given no additional distinguishing information, we assume the likelihoods are equal, i.e., \( P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \).
   - This assumption means that the likelihood cancels out, and we rely on the prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem in this context:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given the symmetric likelihoods \( P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \):

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
