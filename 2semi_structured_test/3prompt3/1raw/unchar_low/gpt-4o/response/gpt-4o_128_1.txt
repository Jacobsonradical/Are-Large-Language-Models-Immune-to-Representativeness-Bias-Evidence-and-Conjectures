To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the described traits, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the methodology step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities**: 
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is 0.25, since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H))\) is 0.75, as there are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

2. **Likelihood**: Assume the description is equally likely for both groups because no specific traits favoring one field over the other (like specific science or humanities skills) were given.
   - \(P(D|CS)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(D|H)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

In the absence of any reason to think the description would be more common in one group over the other, we assume these probabilities are equal, \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem: 
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - Since \(P(D)\) is the same for both groups and we assumed \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), the term simplifies down to:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
     \]
     But in this symmetrical scenario, it simplifies even further (as both \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) cancel out):

So the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\) simplifies to just the prior probability \(P(CS)\) because the description does not give us additional discriminative information:

\[
P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
