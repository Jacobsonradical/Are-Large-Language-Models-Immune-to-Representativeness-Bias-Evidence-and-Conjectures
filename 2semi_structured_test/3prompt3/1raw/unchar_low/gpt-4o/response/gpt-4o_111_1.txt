To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem quantifies the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that event A happens given that event B happened.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B given that event A happens.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of event B.

In this case:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the description provided of Jason.

Given the information, we have:
- 25 computer science professors (hence, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \))
- 75 humanities professors (hence, \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \))

We need to calculate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \).

Since the problem does not provide specific information distinguishing personality traits between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume that the description "Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children. He is known for his high ability and strong motivation. Well-liked by his colleagues, Jason enjoys a positive reputation in his professional environment." is equally likely among both groups. Therefore, we consider \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') = 1 \).

To find \( P(B) \), the marginal probability of the description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 + 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
