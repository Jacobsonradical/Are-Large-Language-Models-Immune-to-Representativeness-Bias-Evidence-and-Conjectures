To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem for this scenario can be outlined as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

Given:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors).
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is not one of the computer science professors, i.e., he is one of the humanities professors).

We are not given explicit probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). However, for simplicity, we can assume that the descriptions fit each group equally likely given the absence of additional differentiating information. Thus, we can assume:

- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

Hence, \( P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \).

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \) and our assumption is they are equally likely, this term will cancel out in Bayes' equation, leaving us with the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Given these assumptions and the absence of additional distinguishing information in the description, the posterior is effectively equal to the prior probability.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
