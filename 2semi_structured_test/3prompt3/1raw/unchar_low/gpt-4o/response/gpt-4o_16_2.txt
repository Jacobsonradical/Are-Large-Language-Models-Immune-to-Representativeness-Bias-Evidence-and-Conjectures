To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description among all professors.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The given description of Jason.

From the given information, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we don't have any specific data that makes the description more or less likely to describe a professor in computer science versus humanities, we can assume that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal. This makes the description equally likely for both groups. Therefore:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

If \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal, the likelihood ratio is 1, simplifying Bayes' Theorem to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Using the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
