Let's address the problem by applying Bayes' Theorem. We will use the information provided to update the prior probability.

First, we need to define our prior probability and the likelihood:
1. The prior probability (P(A)) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the fraction of computer science professors in the sample:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. The prior probability (P(B)) that Jason is a humanities professor is given by the fraction of humanities professors in the sample:
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

Next, we'll consider the likelihood of observing a description like Jason's given that he is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, since the description provided is quite general and doesn't indicate a specific bias towards one field or the other, we will assume the likelihood is approximately equal for both groups:

3. The likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (P(D|A)) and given that he is a humanities professor (P(D|B)) are both about the same, so we can use a neutral assumption:
   \[
   P(D|A) \approx P(D|B)
   \]

Since the description does not differentiate between the groups and our prior probabilities are based on the sample sizes, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor simply reflects the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(D|A)}{P(A) \cdot P(D|A) + P(B) \cdot P(D|B)} \approx \frac{0.25 \cdot 1}{0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
