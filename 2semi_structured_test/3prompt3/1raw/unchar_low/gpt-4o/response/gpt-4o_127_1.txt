To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason fits the given description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given:
- Total professors: 100 (25 computer science and 75 humanities)
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\lnot A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description is drawn randomly and does not favor one discipline over another, we assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\lnot A) \approx 1.0 \) (the probability that any professor fits the description given they are either computer science or humanities professors, which is assumed to be equally likely given the random selection).

Now we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of drawing someone with the description Jason has:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\lnot A) \cdot P(\lnot A) \]

Substituting the probabilities:
\[ P(B) = 1.0 \cdot 0.25 + 1.0 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.0 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1.0 \cdot 0.25}{1.0} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
