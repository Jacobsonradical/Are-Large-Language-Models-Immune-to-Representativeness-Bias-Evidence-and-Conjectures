To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**: 
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \(P(CS)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The prior probability \(P(H)\) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to consider if the description is more likely to fit a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 
   - The description provided doesn't give strong evidence toward one group over the other. It describes Jason as highly capable and motivated, which could apply equally to professors in both domains.

Since there is no strong evidence suggesting Jason fits one category over the other, we assume the likelihood \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\), they cancel each other out in the ratios, simplifying our posterior calculation to the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, is:
