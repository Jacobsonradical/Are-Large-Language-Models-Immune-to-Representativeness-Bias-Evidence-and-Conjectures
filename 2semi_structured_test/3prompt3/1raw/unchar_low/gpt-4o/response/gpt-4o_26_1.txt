To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem applies in this context and helps update our prior beliefs (initial probability) with the likelihood of the observed data under different hypotheses.

### Given:
- Total professors = 100
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75

### Hypotheses:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

### Priors:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

### Evidence:
The description provided does not specify anything directly linked to either field (computer science or humanities), so we assume the description is equally likely under both hypotheses (i.e., both types of professors are equally likely to have such a description).

### Likelihood:
- \( P(E|H_{CS}) \): Probability of the evidence given Jason is a computer science professor. Assume \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 1 \).
- \( P(E|H_{H}) \): Probability of the evidence given Jason is a humanities professor. Assume \( P(E|H_{H}) = 1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_{CS}) * P(H_{CS}) + P(E|H_{H}) * P(H_{H}) \]

Since \( P(E|H_{CS}) = 1 \) and \( P(E|H_{H}) = 1 \), it simplifies to:
\[ P(E) = 1 * 0.25 + 1 * 0.75 = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_{CS}|E) = \frac{1 * 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
