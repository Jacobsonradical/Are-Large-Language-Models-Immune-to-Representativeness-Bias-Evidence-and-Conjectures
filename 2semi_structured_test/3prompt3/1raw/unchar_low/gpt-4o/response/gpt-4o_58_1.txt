Given the information and the description of Jason, we need to update our belief about whether Jason is one of the computer science professors or one of the humanities professors. 

Initially, we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This gives prior probabilities of:
\( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) \\
\( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we need to consider how likely the given description applies to either group. However, the description given is quite generic and does not seem particularly more informative about one group than the other. Without any clear distinguishing features, we assume equal likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Thus, if the description is equally likely for both groups, the likelihood ratio does not favor either group. Consequently, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the prior probability.

Therefore, the posterior probability is still:
\[ P(\text{CS | Description}) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
