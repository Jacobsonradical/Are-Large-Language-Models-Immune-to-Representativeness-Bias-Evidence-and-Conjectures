To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The number of computer science professors is 25.
   - The number of humanities professors is 75.
   - The total number of professors is 100.

   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(B) \), is:
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood**:
   For simplicity, let's assume (absent of further information) that the descriptions provided (such as high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. Thus,
   \[
   P(D|A) = P(D|B) = 1
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)}
   \]
   
   Given that \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) \):
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
