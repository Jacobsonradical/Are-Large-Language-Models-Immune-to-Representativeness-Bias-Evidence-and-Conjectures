To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here,
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

We can define the components as:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor before observing the description. 
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description across all professors (normalizing factor).

First, calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Second, assume the descriptions have equal representation probabilities irrespective of the discipline, implying that:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|ComputerScience) = P(B|Humanities) \]

Given equal likelihoods, the description's probability doesn't change regardless of the field, simplifying the computation.

Thus, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|¬A) \) (where \( ¬A \) denotes Jason being a humanities professor) are both 1 based on equal representation, leading to:

Since we're equally likely to pick any professor's description in a random process:

\[ P(B) = 1 \text{ (because all descriptions are equally likely)} \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
