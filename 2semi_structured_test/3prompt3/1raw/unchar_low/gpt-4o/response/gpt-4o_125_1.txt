To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**:
   We don't have specific likelihood values, but we know he is well-liked, highly capable, and motivated. If we assume (perhaps generously) that these traits are equally likely in computer science and humanities, the likelihoods become:

   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(Desc|CS)\)) = \(x\)
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(Desc|Hum)\)) = \(x\)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

   Since the description is equally likely for both fields, we simplify:
   
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   
   Similarly,
   
   \[
   P(Hum|Desc) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   
   To find \(P(Desc)\), we use the law of total probability:
   
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 = x
   \]

   Thus, the posterior probability is:
   
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.25x}{x} = 0.25
   \]

In conclusion, given that the description was equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, the posterior probability remains the same as the prior.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
