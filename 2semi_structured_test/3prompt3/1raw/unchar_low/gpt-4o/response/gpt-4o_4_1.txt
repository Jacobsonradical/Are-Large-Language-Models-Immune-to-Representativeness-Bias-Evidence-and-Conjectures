Given the data and description provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the given information.

First, let's set up the problem:

- The total number of professors in the sample \( n \) is 100.
- The number of computer science professors \( n_{CS} \) is 25.
- The number of humanities professors \( n_{H} \) is 75.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Assuming that the descriptions do not significantly differ in discernible traits between computer science and humanities professors, we consider \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) to be roughly equal. Thus, these probabilities will cancel out in our equation, and we only need to use the prior probabilities for the population sizes.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{n_{H}}{n} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are roughly equal, we can simplify Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Given the equality:
\[ P(CS | D) \approx \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, given no specific distinguishing traits in the description that favor one discipline over the other, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
