To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here’s how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
   So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   Since the problem does not provide specific likelihoods (i.e., how typical Jason’s description is for each group), we assume that each description is equally likely across both groups.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Given equal likelihoods, the posterior probability can be calculated by normalizing the priors (since the likelihoods cancel out).

So, the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is one of the CS professors given his description \( D \) is:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS) P(D|CS)}{P(CS) P(D|CS) + P(H) P(D|H)}
\]

Given the assumption that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), this simplifies to:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
