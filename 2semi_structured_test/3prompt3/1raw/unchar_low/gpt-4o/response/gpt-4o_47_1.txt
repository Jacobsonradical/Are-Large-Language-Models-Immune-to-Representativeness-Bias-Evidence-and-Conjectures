To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)): 
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)): 
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood** - The probability of observing the description of Jason given the professor's field. This can be challenging to estimate exactly without specific data regarding how descriptions differ between fields. Nevertheless, we might assume that the personality traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are reasonably common among all successful academics and equally likely in both fields if no further distinguishing features are provided:
   \[
   P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|Hum)
   \]

   For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum)
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - The posterior probability \( P(CS|Description) \) is given by:
     \[
     P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
     \]

   Given \(P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum)\), the equation simplifies to:
     \[
     P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
     \]
   
   Substituting the prior probabilities:
     \[
     P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
