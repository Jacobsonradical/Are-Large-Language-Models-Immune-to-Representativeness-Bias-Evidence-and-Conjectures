To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We also need:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor) and
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor).

Since we do not have any specific information indicating that the description is more likely for one group over the other, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups, that is, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Thus, Bayes' Theorem simplifies as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Calculating this:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:
