Given that we have 100 professors in total, with 25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities, we need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We want \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since we do not have specific likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can reasonably assume that the description provided does not particularly favor either category over the other. Thus, we can treat \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) as being approximately equal:
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

By the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we assumed \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), we can denote them both as \( P(D|C) \):
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 = P(D|C) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C)} = P(C) \]

Consequently, the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science is simply the prior probability:
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
