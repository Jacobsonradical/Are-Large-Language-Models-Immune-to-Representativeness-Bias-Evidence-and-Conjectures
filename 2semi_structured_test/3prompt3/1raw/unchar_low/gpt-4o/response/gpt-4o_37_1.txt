To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's go through the calculations step-by-step.

**Bayes' theorem states:**

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want (probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood (probability of Jason's description if he is a CS professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability (overall probability of selecting a CS professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

First, let's assign values to these probabilities:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   
   Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
   
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(\neg A) \):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):** These are the probabilities of Jason's description given the professor is in computer science or humanities respectively. Since we are given a random description and have no other information suggesting a bias, we assume that the likelihoods are the same for both groups. Thus:
   
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]
   
Given that these are the same, the likelihood ratio becomes 1 and cancels itself out in the Bayesian formula.

4. **Total probability \( P(B) \):** The overall probability of Jason’s description can be written as a combination of both possibilities:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

However, since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are assumed equal for simplicity and cancel out, \( P(B) \) reduces to:

\[ P(B) = P(A) + P(\neg A) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Given this setup, Bayes’ theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
