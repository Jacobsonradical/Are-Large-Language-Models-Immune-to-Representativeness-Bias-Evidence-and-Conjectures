First, we need to consider the prior probabilities and any information provided in the description of Jason to make an educated guess.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood** (based on Jasonâ€™s description):
   The description does not contain specific information that distinctly identifies whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. He is described as a 30-year-old man, married, without children, highly capable, strongly motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation.

Since the description given is general and positive, these traits could belong to successful professionals in either field. Thus, there is no strong reason based on the description alone to update the prior probabilities significantly.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Since the description does not notably favor one group over the other, we stick closely to the prior probability. However, any slight adjustment based on non-specificity of the traits (which slightly favors larger groups) should still keep us near our original priors.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains almost the same as the prior:

{"probability": "0.25"}
