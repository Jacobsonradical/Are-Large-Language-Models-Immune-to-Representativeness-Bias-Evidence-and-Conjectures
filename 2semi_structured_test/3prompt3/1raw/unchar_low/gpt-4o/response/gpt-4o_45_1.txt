To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \). However, this part is tricky without additional specific data about how likely such a description is among computer science versus humanities professors. Assuming descriptions for individuals are equally likely across both groups (which reflects not having strong evidence to prefer one group over the other):

- \( P(B|\text{CS}) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities}) \)

We can simplify \( P(B) \) as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})  \]
\[ P(B) \approx P(B) \cdot 0.25 + P(B) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) \approx P(B) \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem and since the likelihoods \( P(B|\text{CS}) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities}) \) cancel out:

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, given the basic assumption of equally likely descriptions, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
