To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given that the prior probabilities are based on the distribution of professors in the sample, and assuming the description doesn't strongly favor one group over the other, Bayes' Theorem can be applied in this way:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   The description of Jason is generic and does not provide specific information that would help differentiate between computer science and humanities professors based on the available traits.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Let \( E \) be the evidence (the description of Jason).
   - We need to calculate \( P(CS|E) \).

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Since the description is equally likely for both groups, we assume:

\[ P(E|CS) = P(E|Hum) = 1 \]

Thus:

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \times P(CS) + P(E|Hum) \times P(Hum) = (1 \times 0.25) + (1 \times 0.75) = 1 \]

Then the posterior probability simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

This means our updated belief, or the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is the same as the prior probability.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
