Given the initial conditions from the study, 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science and 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities. Thus, our prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Conversely, the prior probability that a professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided for Jason doesn't offer specific differentiators between computer science and humanities professorsâ€”attributes like "high ability", "strong motivation", and being "well-liked" are quite general.

Given that the description doesn't significantly discriminate between the two fields, we need to rely on our prior probabilities.

So, our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, will be the same as the prior:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
