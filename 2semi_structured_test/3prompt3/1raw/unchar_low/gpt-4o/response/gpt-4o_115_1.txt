To determine the posterior probability that Jason is among the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A \mid B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of getting a description like Jason's given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting a description like Jason's.

First, let's establish the known probabilities:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) of selecting a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) (the complement, i.e., selecting a humanities professor) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now we consider the probabilities of getting a description like Jason's:
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is tricky to quantify exactly because we do not have detailed information on the relative likelihoods of these descriptions. However, we will assume that the description provided is equally likely for computer science professors and humanities professors due to lack of differentiating information.

Assuming \( P(B \mid A) \approx P(B \mid A^c) \), then:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c) \]

Since \( P(B \mid A) \approx P(B \mid A^c) \), it simplifies to:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B \mid A) \]

Thus, \( P(B \mid A^c) \) is also the same, making:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B \mid A)} = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
