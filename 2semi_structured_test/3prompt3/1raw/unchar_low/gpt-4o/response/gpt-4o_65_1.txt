To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's denote the following:
- \( H_{CS} \): Hypothesis that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H_{Hum} \): Hypothesis that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( E \): Evidence described (the description of Jason).

We want \( P(H_{CS} \mid E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence.

Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since thereâ€™s no particular evidence suggesting that Jason's personality traits are more likely in computer science professors than humanities professors, we assume \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \approx P(E \mid H_{Hum}) \).

The prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H_{Hum}) \) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample:
\[ P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Because \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \approx P(E \mid H_{Hum}) \), these cancel each other out, and Bayes' Theorem simplifies to using just the priors:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) \approx P(H_{CS}) \]

Thus, we have:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) \approx 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.25"}}}
\]
