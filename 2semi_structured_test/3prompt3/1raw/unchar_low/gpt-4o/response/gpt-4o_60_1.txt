Given that you have a description of Jason and we are asked to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how we can compute the posterior probability.

First, let's consider the given information:

- Number of computer science professors: \(25\)
- Number of humanities professors: \(75\)
- Total number of professors: \(100\)
- Prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor: \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we don't have more specific information distinguishing Jason between the groups based on the given description, we assume that the description applies equally likely to both groups.

Let’s calculate the posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since the description does not provide information distinguishing between the fields, we can assume:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \]

Thus:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \), we can denote this common value as \( P(D | any) \). Therefore:

\[ P(D) = P(D | any) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | any) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | any) \cdot ( P(CS) + P(Hum) ) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | any) \cdot 1 \]

Thus:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | any) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | any)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus:

{"probability": "0.25"}
