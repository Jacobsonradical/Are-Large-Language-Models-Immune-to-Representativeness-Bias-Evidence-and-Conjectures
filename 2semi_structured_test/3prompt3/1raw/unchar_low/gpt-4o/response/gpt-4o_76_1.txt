To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of Jason's description.

First, let's assign the prior probabilities:
- The probability that any randomly selected professor is from computer science \( P(A_{CS}) \) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The probability that any randomly selected professor is from the humanities \( P(A_{H}) \) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We need to assume that the description provided for Jason does not favor either group inherently. Let's say that the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is equal to the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(B|A_{H}) \). This implies that:

\[ P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \]

So the marginal probability \( P(B) \) will be:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]

But since \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) are considered equal, they cancel out in the Bayesian update. This leaves us with just the prior probabilities to determine the posterior.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A_{CS}|B) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is simply the prior for computer science professors:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = P(A_{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Accordingly:
{"probability": "0.25"}
