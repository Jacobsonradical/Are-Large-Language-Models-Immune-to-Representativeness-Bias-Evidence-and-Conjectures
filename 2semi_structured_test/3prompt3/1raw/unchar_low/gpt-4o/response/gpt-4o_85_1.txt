To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we have the description of Jason.

We need:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

First, let's find \( P(A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let's assume that descriptions are equally likely among all professors, so \( P(B|A) \) would be equal for computer science and humanities professors.

Then, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Where:
- \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \) (descriptions are equally likely):
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

So, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
