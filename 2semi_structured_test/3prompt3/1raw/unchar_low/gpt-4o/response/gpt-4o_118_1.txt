Given the problem setup, we begin by noting the relevant base rates and the additional description provided for Jason.

1. Base rates:
   - \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - \( P(Hum) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Characteristics in the description:
   - Jason is a 30-year-old man, married, without children, high ability, strong motivation, and well-liked by colleagues. Such characteristics might be equally common in both fields, but the presence of these traits doesn't strongly discriminate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor based on the given description.

Since we don't have any particularly distinguishing features in the personality description that would favor one group over the other, we essentially rely on the base rates.

Using Bayes' theorem, absent any specific evidence that tilts the probabilities away from the base rates, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor would align with the prior probability.

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
