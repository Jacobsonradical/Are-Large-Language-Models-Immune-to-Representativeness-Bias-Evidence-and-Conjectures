To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- The total number of professors (N): 100
- The number of computer science professors (C): 25
- The number of humanities professors (H): 75
- We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's set up the prior probabilities:
- P(C): Probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H): Probability of a randomly chosen professor being a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to consider how likely Jason's description is to fit a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor. Since this isn't specified explicitly in the problem, we'll assume the base rates apply evenly. Thus:
- P(D | C): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor = 1 (assuming no other information)
- P(D | H): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor = 1 (assuming no other information)

Using Bayes' Theorem,
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) * P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | C) * P(C) + P(D | H) * P(H) \) and both P(D | C) and P(D | H) are assumed to be equally likely, P(D) = 1 * 0.25 + 1 * 0.75 = 1.

Therefore,
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{1 * 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25. Therefore, we can express this as: 

{"probability": "0.25"}
