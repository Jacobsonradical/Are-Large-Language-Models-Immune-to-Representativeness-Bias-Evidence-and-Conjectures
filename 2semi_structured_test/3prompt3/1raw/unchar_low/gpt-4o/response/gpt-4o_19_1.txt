To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we would need to evaluate how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given that we don't have specific information about the distinctiveness of the description between the two groups, we'll assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. That is:
- The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science (\(P(D|CS)\)) is 1.
- The probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities (\(P(D|Hum)\)) is 1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(P(CS|D)\)):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D)\) is the same for both groups and the description is equally likely for both groups, \(P(D)\) cancels out in the ratio, and we get:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
