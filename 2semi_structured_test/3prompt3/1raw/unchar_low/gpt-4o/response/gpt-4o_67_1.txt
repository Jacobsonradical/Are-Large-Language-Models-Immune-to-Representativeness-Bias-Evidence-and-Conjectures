To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here it is in formal form:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our goal).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we need to define our priors and likelihoods:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We assume that the descriptions do not depend on the discipline in a way that allows us to conflate the two, meaning \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are roughly equal.

Given the information, we can't directly assess \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). However, if we assume the description applies equally well to professors in both fields, then:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, \( P(B) \) (the total probability of getting the description) remains proportionate to the base rates of computer science and humanities professors, i.e., 0.25 and 0.75 respectively. 

Given this equal likelihood assumption, we find:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(A) \cdot P(B|A) + P(\neg A) \cdot P(B|\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25 \cdot P(B|A)}{0.25 \cdot P(B|A) + 0.75 \cdot P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
