To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Here's the breakdown:
- There are two groups: 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' theorem combines the prior probability with the likelihood of the evidence given each hypothesis.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a described professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a described professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E | CS) \) as the probability of the evidence given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(E | H) \) as the probability of the evidence given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(E) \) as the total probability of the evidence.

The priors are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason is equally likely for professors in both groups (since we only know he is well-liked and highly capable, traits which we assume are evenly distributed):

\[ P(E | CS) = P(E | H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(E | CS) = P(E | H) \), we can say that \( P(E) = P(E | CS) \) as this normalizes the evidence across both groups.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \) cancel out in the normalization, we simplify it to just the priors:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \cdot c \]

Where \( c \) cancels out as evidence is equally likely for both groups, so we get:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
