To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. So the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. We are given Jason's description, which includes being high-ability, strongly motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation. However, we do not have explicit information about how common these traits are in each group. In the absence of specific data, we might initially assume that these characteristics are equally likely to be found in individuals from both groups.

Since we are making an assumption that the likelihood of such a description is the same for both groups, the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) that a computer science professor fits Jason’s description and the likelihood \( P(D | H) \) that a humanities professor fits Jason’s description can be assumed to be equal.

Given these equal likelihoods, the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description can be computed from the priors:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{ P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D) } \]

Here \( P(D) \), the probability of the description, is a normalizing constant. Since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are assumed to be equal, it simplifies to using the priors:

\[ P(CS | D) \approx P(CS) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]
