To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Given the information:

- The prior probability that a professor is from computer science \( P(CS) \) is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities \( P(H) \) is 75/100 = 0.75.

Bayes' theorem in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Given no specific details in the description that make it more likely for Jason to be from computer science compared to humanities, we assume the description \( D \) is equally likely for both groups (i.e., \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)).

Thus we can simplify the equation:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
