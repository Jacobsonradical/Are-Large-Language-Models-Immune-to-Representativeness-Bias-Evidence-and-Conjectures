To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step guide to the reasoning process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

   Similarly, the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(Hum)) is:
   \[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   The likelihood is essentially the conditional probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor and given that he is a humanities professor. Since the description given lacks specific details that differentiate the disciplines of computer science from the humanities, we assume that the description applies equally to both groups. Thus:
   \[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \]

3. **Posterior Probability with Bayes' Theorem**:
   According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   However, as the likelihoods (P(D|CS) and P(D|Hum)) are the same and will cancel out in the calculation, we can simplify this to:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

In this case, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability, as the description does not provide additional information that shifts the likelihoods toward CS or Humanities.

Thus, the posterior probability is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
