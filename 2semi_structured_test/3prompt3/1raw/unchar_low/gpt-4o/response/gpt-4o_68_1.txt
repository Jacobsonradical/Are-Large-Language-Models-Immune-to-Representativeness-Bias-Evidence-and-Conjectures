To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the facts provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define our problem more clearly:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is from Computer Science.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is from the Humanities.
- \( P(CS|D) \): The posterior probability that a professor is from Computer Science given the description \( D \).

Given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in Computer Science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the Humanities.
- The total number of professors is 100, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Bayes' theorem can be written as:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Without specific information differentiating the likelihood of Jason's description between the fields, we might assume that:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \]

In that case, both \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) would cancel out in Bayes' theorem, leading to the following simplification:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
