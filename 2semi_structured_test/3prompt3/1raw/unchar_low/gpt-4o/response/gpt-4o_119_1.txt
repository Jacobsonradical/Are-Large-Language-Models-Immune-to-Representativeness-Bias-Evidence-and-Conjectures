Given the information provided, we need to update our prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided.

First, we use Bayes' theorem. We start with the base rates:
- 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors: \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \)
- 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors: \( P(\text{Hum}) = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate the likelihood of the given description for Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \)) versus a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \)).

Since the description is quite general and does not contain specific details that would strongly indicate one field over the other, we might assume that the probabilities of this description fitting a professor from either group are somewhat similar. If we assume the likelihoods are roughly equal, then the posterior probability will primarily be influenced by the prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \times P(\text{Hum})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given the high likelihood of the description fitting both categories equally (a reasonable assumption given the lack of distinctive information), \( P(\text{Description}) \) cancels out, and we can approximate:

\[ \frac{P(\text{CS}|\text{Description})}{P(\text{Hum}|\text{Description})} \approx \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Hum})} \]

Substituting in the prior probabilities:

\[ \frac{P(\text{CS}|\text{Description})}{P(\text{Hum}|\text{Description})} \approx \frac{0.25}{0.75} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So the probability Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.25"}
