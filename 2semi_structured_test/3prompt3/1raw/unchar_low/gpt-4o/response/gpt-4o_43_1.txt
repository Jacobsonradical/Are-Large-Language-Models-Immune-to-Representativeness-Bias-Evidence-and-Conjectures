To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason being presented.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since the description of Jason is chosen randomly and there is no given distinction in the description that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors, we can assume that \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Therefore, the total probability simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.75 \]

Given the assumption, we have:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]
Let this common probability be \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = k \).

So:
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]

Since it simplifies to \( k \), we don't need to know its exact value for the posterior calculation.

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
