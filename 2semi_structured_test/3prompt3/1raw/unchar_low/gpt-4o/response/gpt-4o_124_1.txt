To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to know the prior probabilities and the likelihoods of observing the given description in each group.

1. Prior Probability:
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Hum})\)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Likelihoods:
   - Probability of observing Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{desc}|\text{CS})\))
   - Probability of observing Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum})\))

Since the description provided does not give specific information biased towards either group, we will assume the descriptions are equally likely for both groups:
   - \(P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum})\)

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{desc}) = \frac{P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{desc})} \]

Where \( P(\text{desc}) = P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \)

Given that \( P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum}) \), the terms will cancel out in the equation:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{desc}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Hum})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
