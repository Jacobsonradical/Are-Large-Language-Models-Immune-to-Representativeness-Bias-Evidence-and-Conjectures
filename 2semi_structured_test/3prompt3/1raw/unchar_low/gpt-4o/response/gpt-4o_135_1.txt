To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the given data and apply the formula.

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's define our events:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the observed description of Jason.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors = 25.
- Number of humanities professors = 75.
- Total number of professors = 100.

We will assume that the described traits of high ability and strong motivation, and being well-liked, are equally likely among computer science and humanities professors unless specified otherwise (since no additional specific likelihood information is given for these traits).

Let's compute:
- \( P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is not a computer science professor, i.e., he is a humanities professor.
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \].

Without additional information suggesting a different likelihood for descriptions between the two groups, we assume:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \), as the description does not seem skewed towards a specific discipline.

Since the description's probability is roughly equal for both fields (\( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \)), the posterior probability depends only on the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) simplifies as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \].

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25:
