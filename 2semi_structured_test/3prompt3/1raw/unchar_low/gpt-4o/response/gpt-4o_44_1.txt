To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step calculation.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total.
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor, \(P(Hum)\): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total.
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need the likelihood of the description given the professor is in computer science, \(P(D|CS)\), and given the professor is in humanities, \(P(D|Hum)\). However, with the given information, we don't have any specific reason to believe that "high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked" is more likely in one group over the other. If we assume these characteristics are equally likely among both groups, we can assume:
     \[
     P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)
     \]

3. **Posterior probability:**
   By Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Here, \(P(D)\) can be determined using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Since we assumed \(P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)\):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|CS) \cdot P(Hum) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum)) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot 1} = P(CS)
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[
P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.25
\]

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
