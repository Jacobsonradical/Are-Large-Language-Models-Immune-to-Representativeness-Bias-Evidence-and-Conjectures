To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Assuming that the description provided is equally likely for professors in both fields, we can use the prior probabilities to calculate the posterior.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that there's no additional distinguishing information in the description favoring one field over the other, the likelihoods \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description}|\text{Hum}) \) are equal. Thus, they cancel out in Bayes' Theorem, leaving us with:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) must be the same for both disciplines, we can simplify to:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{\{"probability": "0.25"\}} \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
