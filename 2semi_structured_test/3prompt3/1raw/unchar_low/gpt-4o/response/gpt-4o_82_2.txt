To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of receiving the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of receiving the description.

First, we need to identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(A') \), the probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Since we are not given any additional information specific to the disciplines that would influence the likelihood of the description, we can assume that the likelihood of the description being given is independent of the discipline:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A') \]

Hence, the overall probability \( P(B) \) of being presented with the description is simply:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Given that \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \), it simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore,

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So the answer would be in the following format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
