To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description that matches Jason is chosen.

We need to estimate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is the proportion of computer science professors among the total sample. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is the proportion of humanities professors among the total sample. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since \( B \) does not seem to favor any particular group given just the professional description and not specific to the disciplines' distinctive traits, we will assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal. This assumption means that the likelihood of receiving this description doesn't differ significantly between the two groups.

Let’s denote these likelihoods as:
- \( P(B|A) \): probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
We assume that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), so we don’t factor these in when splitting the posterior probability calculation.

In this simplified model, the posterior probability calculation reduces to using only the priors because the description provided does not allow us to differentiate between the groups.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the priors:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So the answer in the required format is:
