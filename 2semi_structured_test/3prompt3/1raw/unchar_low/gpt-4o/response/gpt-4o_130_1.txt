To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

We start with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we are given no additional information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors based on the personality description alone, we consider the likelihood of the given description occurring for any professor (whether in computer science or humanities) to be equal. Thus:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \approx 1 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \approx 1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(H | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given \( P(\text{description} | C) \approx P(\text{description} | H) \approx 1 \), the posterior probability simplifies to the prior ratios:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
