To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - Probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - Probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(Hum)) is: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - We assume that the likelihood of receiving Jason's description is equally distributed among both groups given no additional distinguishing traits specific to either group. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \) are considered the same.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation** using Bayes' Theorem:
    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]
    Here, \( P(D) \) is the normalization factor:
    \[
    P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
    \]
    Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \), these terms cancel out in the probability calculation:
    
    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25
    \]

Therefore, given the information and the assumptions, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
