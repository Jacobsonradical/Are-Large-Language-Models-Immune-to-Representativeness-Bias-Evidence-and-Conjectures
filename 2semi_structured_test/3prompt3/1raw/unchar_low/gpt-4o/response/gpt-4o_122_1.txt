Let's start by determining the prior probabilities of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)) or a humanities professor (P(H)). We know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, so:

- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, let's use Bayesian reasoning to calculate the posterior probability. We need to update these priors based on the description given. However, the description given (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) seems fairly generic and doesn't seem to favor one group over the other based on the information we have. Due to the lack of specific distinguishing information, we can reasonably assume that the likelihood of this description applying to either group is roughly the same. Thus, we won't change the prior probabilities.

The calculation therefore stays as follows:

- P(CS|Description) â‰ˆ P(CS) = 0.25

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
