To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(  \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Jason has the description given.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we are not given the exact probabilities of Jason's description given his field, we assume that the description provided does not favor any field disproportionately without any additional bias. Hence, let's assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \). In this case, \( P(B) \) (the overall probability of the description) would be:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), and let's denote this common probability as \( P(B| \text{Both}) \), then:

\[ P(B) = P(B| \text{Both}) \cdot P(A) + P(B| \text{Both}) \cdot P(\neg A) = P(B| \text{Both}) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = P(B| \text{Both}) \cdot 1 = P(B| \text{Both}) \]

Since \( P(B| \text{Both}) \) cancels out:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{1} = P(A) \]

Therefore, if the description is equally likely for both fields, the posterior probability is the same as the prior probability.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So the answer is:
