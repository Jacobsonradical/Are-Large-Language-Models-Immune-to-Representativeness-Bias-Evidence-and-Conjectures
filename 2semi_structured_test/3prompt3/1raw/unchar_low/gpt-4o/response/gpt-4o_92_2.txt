To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = The given description of Jason.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
Since there are 25 computer science professors and 100 total professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is not a computer science professor, is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample.
Since there are 75 humanities professors and 100 total professors, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description is fairly generic and equally likely to describe professors from either field given the constraints (successful, well-liked, highly motivated), we can reasonably assume these probabilities to be roughly equal.

Thus, we estimate:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \),

And by assuming \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), these likelihoods cancel out, resulting in:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
