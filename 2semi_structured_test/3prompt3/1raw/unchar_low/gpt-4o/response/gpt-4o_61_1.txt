Given that we are presented with one description chosen at random among 100 available descriptions, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \), the probability of selecting a computer science professor, is \( 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \), the probability of selecting a humanities professor, is \( 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).

For simplicity in this case, we assume that the likelihood of the description being representative of either group (\( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \)) is approximately equal since there is no specific information indicating otherwise.

In typical Bayesian updating, where the description doesn't particularly favor one group because both groups were sampled with the assumption of being represented equally by successful traits, we wonâ€™t heavily weight the likelihood term differently.

Thus, under these simplifying assumptions, Bayes' formula \( P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \) simplifies considering \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) cancel out proportionally:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \times P(H) \]

Given:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \times P(H) \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
