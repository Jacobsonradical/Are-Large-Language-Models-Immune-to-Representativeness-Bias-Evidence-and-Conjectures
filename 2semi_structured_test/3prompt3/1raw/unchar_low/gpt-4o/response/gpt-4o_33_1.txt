To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to find the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. Here, our hypothesis is that Jason is a computer science professor, and our evidence is the description of Jason.

First, let's define some terms:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(H|D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

We will calculate \( P(CS|D) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

If we assume that the descriptive characteristics such as high ability, strong motivation, good reputation, etc., are equally likely between computer science and humanities professors (i.e., assuming no specific bias in the descriptions provided), we can set \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) as equal. Because they are ratios, these cancel each other out in the calculation.

Assuming no bias and a fair distribution of the traits described:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

So:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
