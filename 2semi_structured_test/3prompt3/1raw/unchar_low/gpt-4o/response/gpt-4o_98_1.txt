To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen randomly from the 100 professors.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming the description does not preferentially describe professors from either field (i.e., the description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors), the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are the same. Hence, \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \).

In this case, \( P(D) \), the overall probability of drawing this description, is a weighted combination of drawing the description from either of the two groups:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 = P(D | CS) \]

Now, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
