Let's break down the problem using Bayes' Theorem.

We need to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \).

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the fraction of computer science professors in the total sample. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we get:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason's description. This is essentially a weighted average of the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor and the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we do not have specific data on \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \text{not } A) \), we can assume that the description might be equally likely for both types of professors until specific data suggests otherwise. As such, for simplicity, we can assume equal likelihood which means:

\[ P(B | A) \approx P(B | \text{not } A) \]

Given that:

\[ P(\text{not } A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Then:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Assuming equal likelihood for both types of professors (\( P(B | A) \approx P(B | \text{not } A) \)), \( P(B) \) roughly balances out:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B | A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B | A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B | A) \]

Which simplifies our posterior to just considering the prior ratios due to equal likelihood, so:

\[ P(A | B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
