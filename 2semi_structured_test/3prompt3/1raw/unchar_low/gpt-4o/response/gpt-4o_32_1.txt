To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, you can use Bayesian inference. Specifically, we'll apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): The description of Jason.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors: 100.

Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(A)\):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(\neg A)\):
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to find:
- \( P(B | A) \): Probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | \neg A) \): Probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Assuming that the description fits computer science and humanities professors equally well, we assume:
\[ P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \]

Since \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \) reflect the likelihood that a randomly chosen professor (from either group) would have Jason's traits, and given no specific information that these traits are more or less likely in one group, we will assume:
\[ P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \) are the same and are normalized over the total professors:
\[ P(B) = 1 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given \( P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

So, the answer would be:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
