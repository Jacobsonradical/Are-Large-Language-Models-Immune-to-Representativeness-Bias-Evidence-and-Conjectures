To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the event:
- \(A\) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \(B\) = The description provided fits Jason

We are trying to find \(P(A|B)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Therefore, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor \(P(H)\) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Assume that the description is equally likely to fit a computer science professor or a humanities professor:
- \(P(B|A) = P(B|H)\)

Thus, the total probability of the description \(P(B)\) is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
