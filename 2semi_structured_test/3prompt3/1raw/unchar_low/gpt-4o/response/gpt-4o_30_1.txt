The question is asking for the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description. To determine this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior probability**: The priors are given by the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus, the priors are:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing the description given the professor's discipline. Since we don't have specific data on how likely the description fits professors from computer science versus humanities, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Hence:
   - \( P(Desc | CS) = P(Desc | Hum) \)

3. **Posterior probability**: We use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

Given \( P(Desc | CS) \approx P(Desc | Hum) \), the denominator \( P(Desc) \) is similarly influenced by both probabilities and thus largely cancels out. Therefore, the posterior probability simplifies to:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
