To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is a mathematical representation of how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we have the given description of Jason. 

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \). 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of having the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the given description.

First, we need to calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(A) \)):
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - Hence, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood** (\( P(B|A) \)):
   - Without additional data suggesting one group fits the description better than the other, we assume that every professor could fit the description equally, regardless of their discipline.
   - Under this assumption, \( P(B|A) \) = \( P(B|A^c) \).

3. **Total Probability** (\( P(B) \)):
   - This is the total probability of getting the description \( B \).
   - Given our equal assumption, \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \).
   - Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \),
   - Let \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = k \). We don't have \( k \), but it cancels out in the calculation.
   - Therefore, \( P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(A^c) = k(0.25 + 0.75) = k \).

When calculating Bayes' theorem with this information:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25.
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
