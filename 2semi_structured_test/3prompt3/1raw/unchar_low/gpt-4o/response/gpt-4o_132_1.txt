To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where,
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event \( A \) occurring given that \( B \) is true (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event \( B \) occurring given that \( A \) is true (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event \( A \) occurring.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event \( B \) occurring.

In this context,
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason fits the given description.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since there is no additional information suggesting that either group would be more likely to fit Jason's description, we assume:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{H}) \).

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]

Since we assumed \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{H}) \), these terms would cancel each other out, simplifying our use of Bayes' theorem to:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_{H})} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, given the description provided and without any additional details emphasizing a distinction, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
