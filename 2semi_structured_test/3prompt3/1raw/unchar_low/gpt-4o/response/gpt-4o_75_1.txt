To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor

We are provided with the following:

- Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(C) \)): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(C) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).

Since we do not have any specific information in the description that strongly favors either group over the other, we'll assume that the likelihood of observing a description like Jason's given that he is a computer scientist (\( P(D|C) \)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)) are equal. Thus, \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Given \( P(C) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
