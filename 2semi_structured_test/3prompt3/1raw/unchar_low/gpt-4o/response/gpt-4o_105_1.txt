To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we must use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, let's define the terms:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description being written for a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description being written.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
- 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

So:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description is equally likely to be written for a computer science professor or a humanities professor (same traits for both):

\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \]

Therefore, 

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \), it simplifies to:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) (P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \]

So,

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})} \]
\[ = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{1} = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
