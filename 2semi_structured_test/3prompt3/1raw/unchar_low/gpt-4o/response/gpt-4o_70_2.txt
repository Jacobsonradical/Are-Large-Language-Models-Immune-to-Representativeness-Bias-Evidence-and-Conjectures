To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description provided, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the events as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason as given.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor).
- And \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor).

Now, we need to compare \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
- Since the description is given generally and doesn't significantly sway towards a stereotype of either field, we could assume \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \).

Given \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), the posterior probability primarily depends on the prior probabilities. As \( P(D) \) can be broken into \( P(D | C)P(C) + P(D | H)P(H) \), and \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \):

\[ P(C | D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.25 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
