To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description provided.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We also need the likelihood of the description given the professor's field.
Assuming the personality traits described are equally likely in both fields (as no special information suggests otherwise), the likelihoods are equal:
- \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\)

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly,
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), the probabilities normalize directly in proportion to their priors:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
