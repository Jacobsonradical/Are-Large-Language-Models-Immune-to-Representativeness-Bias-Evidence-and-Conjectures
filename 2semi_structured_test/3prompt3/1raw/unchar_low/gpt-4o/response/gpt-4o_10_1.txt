To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- We're given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \) since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Since the description doesn't strongly differentiate between the disciplines, we might reasonably assume that Jason being described in that manner is equally probable whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Hence, \( P(D|C) \) is approximately equal to \( P(D|H) \).

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), this implies:

\[ P(D) \approx P(D|C) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) + P(D|H) \cdot \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \]

But since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately equal, it divides out:

\[ P(D) \approx P(D|C) \]

So, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1/4}{1} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is 0.25. 

So, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
