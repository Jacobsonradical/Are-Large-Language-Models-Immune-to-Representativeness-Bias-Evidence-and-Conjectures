To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is in computer science given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Firstly, we know the priors \( P(A) \) and \( P(A^c) \), where \( A \) indicates being a computer science professor and \( A^c \) indicates being a humanities professor:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given that we do not have specific information that would lead us to believe the description is more likely to apply to one group over the other, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \). With this assumption, we see that "high ability and strong motivation" plus being "well-liked by colleagues" are traits that are not necessarily more prevalent in either group.

So, let's assume that:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \) 

Therefore, Bayes' Theorem simplifies:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]

This simplifies down to \( P(A|B) = 0.25 \).

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{\"probability\": \"0.25\"}
