Given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description,
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Professor}) \)). Given the description, there's no specific information strongly indicating a preference for either field, so we might assume that the description is equally likely for CS and Humanities professors. If we assume the likelihoods are equal:

\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Professor}) \]

Given that the description is equally likely for either, we proceed with using the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor})P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Professor})P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]

Since the description likelihood was taken as equal:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = x \times P(\text{CS Professor}) + x \times P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = x \times 0.25 + x \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = x \]

We see that because we assumed the likelihoods are equal, this step simplifies in this context as the ratio between the priors will remain the same. As a result, our posterior is proportional to the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor})P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ = \frac{x \times 0.25}{x} \]
\[ = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
