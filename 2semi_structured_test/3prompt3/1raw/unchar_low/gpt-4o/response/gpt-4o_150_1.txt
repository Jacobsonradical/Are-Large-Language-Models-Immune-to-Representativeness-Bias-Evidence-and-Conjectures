To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given the information, we want to compute \( P(C|D) \), where \( C \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( D \) is the description provided.

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description.

We are given the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Similarly, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (where \( H \) is the event Jason is a humanities professor).

Assuming that the description is equally likely for both groups, \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) would be equivalent:
- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

The overall probability of the description \( P(D) \) remains the same, whether we condition on \( C \) or \( H \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can denote both as \( P(D|P) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|P) \cdot P(C) + P(D|P) \cdot P(H) = P(D|P) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|P) \]

So the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \) simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
