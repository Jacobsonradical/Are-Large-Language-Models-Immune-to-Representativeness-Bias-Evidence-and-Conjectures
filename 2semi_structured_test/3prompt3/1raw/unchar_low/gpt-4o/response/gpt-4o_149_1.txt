To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let:
- A be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- B be the event that we have the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **P(B|A)**: The probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor. Without more information, we assume descriptions are equally likely among groups.

3. **P(B|¬A)**: The probability of the given description if Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor). Again, we assume descriptions are equally likely among groups.

4. **P(B)**: The total probability of the description B:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A) \]
   Since descriptions are equally likely in both groups and there are no additional distinguishing characteristics:
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|¬A) \]
   Therefore,
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot (1 - P(A)) \]
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

Substituting these into Bayes' theorem, since \( P(B|A) \) cancels out:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(¬A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
