To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of having Jason's description.

We'll break this down step by step to find the required probability.

### Step 1: Prior Probability \( P(A) \)
This is the probability of Jason being a computer science professor without any additional information. The prior probabilities can be calculated from the sample sizes.

- Total number of professors = 25 (computer science) + 75 (humanities) = 100
- \( P(A) \) for computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### Step 2: Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)
We need to determine how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor to update our prior probability.

Given that the description does not provide any definitive traits inclinable to either field (e.g., it lacks specific mentions of technical or humanities-related attributes), we can assume that the event \( B \) (description of Jason) is equally likely to occur irrespective of the field.

Thus, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of having the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of having the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Given our assumption that Jason's description is generic and applies equally to both groups (computer science and humanities), \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Posterior \( P(A|B) \)
Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), the probability \( P(B) \) can be written as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = p \cdot 0.25 + p \cdot 0.75 = p \]
where \( p \) is the probability of the description \( B \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p} = 0.25 \]

Thus, given the description is generic, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the same as the prior:

\[ \mathbf{P(A|B) = 0.25} \]

Therefore, the posterior probability is:
