Given the information from the study and the description of Jason, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

We start by noting the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 25 + 75 = 100.

Thus, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is from the computer science group is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability \( P(HUM) \) that Jason is from the humanities group is:
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We are given a description of Jason that indicates he is a 30-year-old man, married without children, highly capable and motivated, and well-liked by his colleagues. However, this description is fairly generic and does not provide strong evidence favoring one group over the other.

Let's assume that this description equally applies to both groups of professors with some simplification because we are not given any base rate for such characteristics distinctly favoring one group over another.

Given the lack of specific bias from the description toward either group, the likelihoods \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | HUM) \) can be considered roughly equal. Under this assumption:

\[ P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | HUM) \]

Using Bayes' theorem for the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since \( P(Description) \) is a normalizing constant and \( P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | HUM) \), we can simplify the posterior probability \( P(CS | Description) \):

\[ P(CS | Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
