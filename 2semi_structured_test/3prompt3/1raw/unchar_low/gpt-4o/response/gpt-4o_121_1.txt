To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of the description provided should match with Jason's profile.

We need to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

**Step 1: Determine \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.**
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

**Step 2: Determine \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.**
- We donâ€™t have specific details about the variance of descriptions, so we assume that the descriptions are equally likely across disciplines.
- Therefore, \( P(B|A) \) is some constant probability, say \( x \).

**Step 3: Determine \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that Jason is not a computer science professor.**
- If there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, then \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

**Step 4: Determine \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.**
- Similarly, \( P(B|\neg A) \) is another constant probability, say \( y \).

**Step 5: Determine \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description.**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = x \cdot 0.25 + y \cdot 0.75 \]

Assuming descriptions are equally likely (that is, no preference based on field and hence x and y are effectively representing the likelihoods in equal measure):
\[ P(B) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = x(0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = x \] (since \(0.25 + 0.75 = 1\))

Since we have assumed equally likely merging of descriptions, we find cancelling \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = x \):

Thus our effective probability, reorganized becomes:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{(P(A) + P(\neg A))} 
 \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{ (0.25 + 0.75)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

In this case, given the frameworks for evaluating without bias in speculative descriptions:

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.25 \]
