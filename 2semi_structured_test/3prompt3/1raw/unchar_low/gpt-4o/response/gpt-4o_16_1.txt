To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to account for the proportion of computer science professors in the sample and update our beliefs based on the description provided.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total of 100 professors.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description doesn't favor either group more strongly (i.e., it is equally likely to describe a computer science professor and a humanities professor), we use Bayes' Theorem to update our probability. Since the description does not provide information that differentiates strongly between the two groups, we assume the likelihood of the description for both groups is equal.

\[ P(Description \mid CS) \approx P(Description \mid Hum) \]

By applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{P(Description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Similarly,

\[ P(Hum \mid Description) = \frac{P(Description \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(Description)} \]

Given that the description is equally likely for both groups:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Since \( P(Description \mid CS) \approx P(Description \mid Hum) \):

\[ P(Description) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = k(0.25 + 0.75) = k \]

Thus,

\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

We find that the description doesn't alter our prior probability. Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains:

\[ \boxed{\left\{ \text{"probability"}: "0.25" \right\}} \]
