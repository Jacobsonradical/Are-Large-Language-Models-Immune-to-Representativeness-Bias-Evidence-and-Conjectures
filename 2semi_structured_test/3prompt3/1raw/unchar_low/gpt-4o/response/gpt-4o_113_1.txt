Given the problem structure, we need to update our beliefs about Jason's field using Bayes' Theorem. We start with some data:

- The prior probability that Jason is from computer science (CS) or humanities (H):
  \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description provided is not directly linked to any specific field and doesn't give us much more unique information to update the prior probabilities; we'll treat both groups (CS and humanities professors) as likely to possess the traits described.

Therefore, without further differentiation, the likelihoods \( P(Description|CS) \) and \( P(Description|H) \) are assumed equal.

From Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|H) \), they cancel out in the equation:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
