To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given of Jason.

From the problem, we know:
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(C) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need the likelihoods:
- \( P(D \mid C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since no specific information is given about how descriptions differ between computer science and humanities professors, we can initially assume that these likelihoods are equal. In this kind of scenario where the descriptions are general and do not favor one group over the other, we can simplify the calculation by assuming:
- \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \).

Given this assumption, the posterior probability is largely determined by the priors.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
Similarly:
\[
P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D \) properly normalizes these probabilities, the simpler form is:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the priors:
\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25
\]

Thus:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
