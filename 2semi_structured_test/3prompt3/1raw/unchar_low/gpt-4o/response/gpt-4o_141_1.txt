To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that someone selected is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \):
   \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary Prior Probability** \( P(A^c) \):
   \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we assume that the description of Jason is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors because we don't have any additional information indicating otherwise. Therefore:
\[ P(B|\text{CS Prof}) = P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) \]

Since Jason's description given either profession doesn't provide a more probable likelihood, \( P(B|\text{CS Prof}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) \) are equal and will cancel out in the Bayes' Theorem calculation. Therefore, the posterior probability only depends on the prior probabilities.

Thus, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's Description}|\text{CS Prof}) * P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(\text{Jason's Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Jason's Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \) and \( P(\text{Jason's Description}) \) involve the same factor for both cases, we can simplify:
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Jason's Description}) = P(\text{CS Prof}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
