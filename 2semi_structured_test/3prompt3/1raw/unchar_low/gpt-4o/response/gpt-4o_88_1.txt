To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this case:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the provided description of Jason.

First, we need to establish:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the provided description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the provided description being observed.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description does not provide any specific information that clearly distinguishes between the two groups, we can assume that the probability of such a description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally likely for successful academics in both fields. Therefore:

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Assuming descriptions are equally likely across both disciplines, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Because \( P(B) \) sums to 1 over the possibilities of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor under the assumption of equal likelihood of the description in both groups, we simplify:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let this probability be \( x \):
\[ P(B) = x \cdot P(A) + x \cdot P(\neg A) = x \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = x \]

The description doesn't deviate for being more likely in computer science or humanities, so:

\[ P(B|A) = x \]

Given both \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are approximately the same, and they essentially cancel out in their effects on \( P(B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
