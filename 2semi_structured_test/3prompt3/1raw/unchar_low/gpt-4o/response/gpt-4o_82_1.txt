To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem links the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- We are to choose a description randomly from these 100.

Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the given description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, define the probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Because there is no specific information suggesting that the description of Jason, who is high ability, strongly motivated, well-liked, and enjoys a positive professional reputation, is more likely for one field over the other, we can assume that \( P(D \mid C) \approx P(D \mid H) \).

Since the choice of the description is random:
\[ P(D \mid C) \] and \[ P(D \mid H) \] would likely balance each other out as there is no bias in the description to favor one group.

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) P(C) + P(D \mid H) P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D \mid C) \approx P(D \mid H) \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Therefore, 
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.25"}} ]
