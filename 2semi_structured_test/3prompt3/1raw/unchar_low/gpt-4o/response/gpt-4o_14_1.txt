To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing the description.

First, let's consider the prior probability, \( P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have specific information that suggests the description is more likely to fit a computer science professor over a humanities professor (or vice versa), we can assume that the descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Thus:

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equal, they will cancel each other out in the Bayes' Theorem formula. Hence:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
