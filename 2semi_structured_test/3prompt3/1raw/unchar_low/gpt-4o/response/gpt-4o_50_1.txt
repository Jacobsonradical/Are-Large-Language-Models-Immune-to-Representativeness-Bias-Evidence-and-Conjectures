To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability of choosing a computer science professor randomly from the sample (P(CS)) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability of choosing a humanities professor randomly from the sample (P(H)) is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - To use Bayes' Theorem, we need the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), where \( D \) is the given description. 
   - Without additional specific information about the difference in personality traits between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the likelihood of the given description \( D \) for a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \) is roughly similar to that for a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \). Therefore, we assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Since we assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) is proportional to the prior probability \( P(CS) \).
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
     Here, \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups and thus cancels out when comparing the relative probabilities.
     \[
     P(CS|D) \propto P(CS) = 0.25
     \]

So, under the assumption that the description does not specifically favor one type of professor over the other, and since \( P(CS|D) \) is proportional to \( P(CS) \), we can normalize it considering the sum of posteriors should equal to 1 (noting that \( P(H|D) = 0.75 \) is the complementary probability). Therefore, \( P(CS|D) = 0.25 \).

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
