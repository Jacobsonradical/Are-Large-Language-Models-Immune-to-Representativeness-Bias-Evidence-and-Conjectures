To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's denote the following:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \) as the probability of the given description.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

The total prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(CS | Desc) \):
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Given:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Since the description does not clearly favor any particular field (computer science or humanities), we may assume \( P(Desc | CS) = P(Desc | Hum) \). Therefore, the description is equally likely for both groups. Let's denote this common probability as \( P(Desc | Field) \).

Therefore:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | Field) \times P(CS) + P(Desc | Field) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | Field) \times (P(CS) + P(Hum)) \]
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | Field) \times 1 \]
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | Field) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc)} = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc | Field)} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | Field) \times 0.25}{P(Desc | Field)} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \boxed{\{ "probability": "0.25" \}} \]
