Given the description of Jason, we need to calculate the posterior probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The approach will use Bayes' theorem, where we need to consider the prior probabilities of Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor and update these priors based on how likely it is that this description fits these groups.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   The likelihoods in this case would describe the probability of getting such a description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, based on the given information, we do not have any specific likelihood data directly comparing the probability of such descriptions among both groups. Thus, for simplification, assume the descriptions are somewhat interspersed equally, meaning the likelihoods \(P(Description|CS)\) and \(P(Description|Hum)\) have no distinct differential information without further specifications.

Given these assumptions, we proceed by focusing primarily on the prior probabilities:

By using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Without specific information on likelihoods suggesting any bias towards one group, we assume:
\[ P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|Hum) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(CS|Description) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
