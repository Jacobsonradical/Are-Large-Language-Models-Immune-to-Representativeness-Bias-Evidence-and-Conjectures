Let's start by calculating the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
So, the prior probability for computer science (P(CS)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability for humanities (P(H)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information favoring one group over the other (either computer science or humanities), we do not have additional evidence to update our priors.

Therefore, our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
