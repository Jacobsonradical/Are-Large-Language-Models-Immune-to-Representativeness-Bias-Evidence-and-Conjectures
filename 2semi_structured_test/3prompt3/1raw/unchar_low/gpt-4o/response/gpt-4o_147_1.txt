Given the study design and your description of Jason, we need to use Bayesian reasoning to compute the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor. 

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The marginal probability of the description.

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
  
So, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We are asked to compute \( P(CS | D) \), which can be derived using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can break \( P(D) \) into its components as well:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we do not have specific information about \( P(D | CS) \) or \( P(D | H) \) regarding Jason's description, we'll assume there's no reason to believe that the given description makes Jason significantly more or less likely to be from either field. In this case, without further details on the likelihoods, we can assume \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are roughly equal. This means that they cancel out in the Bayes' theorem ratio, simplifying our calculation:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Given the above reasoning and under the assumption that the description does not sway the likelihood significantly, the posterior probability remains largely determined by the prior:
