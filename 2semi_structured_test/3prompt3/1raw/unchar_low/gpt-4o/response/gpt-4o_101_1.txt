To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description fits Jason.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of getting Jason's description.

Assuming that the description is equally likely to come from either discipline, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor) are the same. That simplifies our calculations because we are only interested in the ratio of professors between disciplines due to equal distribution assumption of description characteristics.

1. \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)  (There are equal chances to randomly select Jason from any professor, but we need to weight this equally first.)
2. \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
3. Since we assume the description does not bias towards any category, \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \),

Consequently,
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equal and both cancel out in their simplified fractions,

Therefore,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Nevertheless, given the description traits of high ability and strong motivation explicitly specified (yet not uniquely identifying), we uphold the disciplined setting randomness balance. Thus modifying calculations remains nuanced.

So, initial assumed embodiment adjusts:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.25"} \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
