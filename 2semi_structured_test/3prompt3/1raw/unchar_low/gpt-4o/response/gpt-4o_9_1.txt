To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given information:
- There are 25 computer science professors (A).
- There are 75 humanities professors (not A).
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\text{not A}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description does not favor either computer science professors or humanities professors specifically given the traits of high ability, strong motivation, and a positive reputation, we can assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not A}) \). For simplicity, let's assume both are equal.

So, the total probability of the description \( P(B) \), under the law of total probability, is:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not A}) \cdot P(\text{not A}) \]

Given \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not A}) \),

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|\text{not A}) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
