To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a structured approach to solving the problem:

1. **Prior probability (base rate)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability (P(H)) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We do not have specific data on how likely it is that a description like Jason's would come from either the computer science or humanities professors, so we assume that each group's traits could produce such a description with equal likelihood.

3. **Posterior probability** calculation:
   - Since the description is equally likely for both groups, the likelihood term for each group cancels out, resulting in reliance solely on the prior probabilities.

So the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science department is equal to the prior probability.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
