Firstly, we need to establish the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Similarly, the prior probability (P(Hum)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[
P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we must consider the description of Jason and determine if any provided information gives us reason to update our priors. The description includes characteristics like age, marital status, high ability, strong motivation, a positive professional reputation, and good relations with colleagues. 

Given that no specific trait particularly favors one discipline over the other (since both computer science and humanities professors can have high ability, strong motivation, and a positive professional reputation), we should assume that the likelihood of these traits is equal across both groups.

Hence, since no new evidence strongly guides us to update our priors, our prior probability should remain unchanged. Consequently, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the prior probability:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
