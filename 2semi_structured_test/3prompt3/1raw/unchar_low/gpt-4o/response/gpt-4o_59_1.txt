To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we approach it:

**1. Calculate prior probabilities:**
- Probability that the description is of a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability that the description is of a humanities professor (P(Hum)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

**2. Calculate the likelihood:**
We assume that the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups because there's no specific additional information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors in this case. Therefore:
- Probability of the description if Jason is a CS professor (P(Description | CS)): This is not specified, so we assume \(= x\)
- Probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor (P(Description | Hum)): This is not specified, so we assume \(= x\)

**3. Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:**

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Given that \(P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)\):

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
