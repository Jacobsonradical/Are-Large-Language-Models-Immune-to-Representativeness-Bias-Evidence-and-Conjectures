To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided.

We want to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description does not provide specific information favoring either discipline, we may assume, for simplicity, that the likelihood of this description is the same for both groups:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Since \( P(D) \) is a normalization factor and is equal for both groups:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
