To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):** This is the probability of selecting a computer science professor from the given sample:

\[ P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Profs}}{\text{Total Number of Profs}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**
This is the probability of selecting a humanities professor from the given sample:

\[ P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Profs}}{\text{Total Number of Profs}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Probability of Description \( P(B) \):** This is the total probability of getting the description, which incorporates both types of professors. This can be expressed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS Prof}) * P(\text{CS Prof}) + P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) * P(\text{Humanities Prof}) \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
Given the limited information, we might assume that the probability of this description given either a computer science professor or a humanities professor is similar, as there is no information that suggests otherwise.

\[ P(B|\text{CS Prof}) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) \]
Letâ€™s assume they are equal, thus they cancel out in the fraction, making the posterior simply the proportion of computer science professors.

Therefore,
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS Prof}) * P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Given the symmetry and equal likelihood assumption, we conclude:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
