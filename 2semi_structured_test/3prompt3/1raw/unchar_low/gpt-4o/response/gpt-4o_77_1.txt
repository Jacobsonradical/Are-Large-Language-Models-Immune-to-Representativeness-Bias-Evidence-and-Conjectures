To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description and the fact that he is drawn from a pool of 100 professors—25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities—we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, without specific prior information about how likely the description is given each category, we need to consider that this description could apply equally to both groups. 

Thus, if:
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

Then the posterior probability can be simplified as:
\[ P(C|D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Since:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.25"}
