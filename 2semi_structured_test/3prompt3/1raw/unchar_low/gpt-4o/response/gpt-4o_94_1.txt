To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability of picking a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor is \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, let's denote:

- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) as the probability of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.

The description provided gives traits that could be common in both fields â€” high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation. Therefore, we may assume \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \) due to lack of specific differentiating factors in the description. For simplicity, assume these probabilities are equal and represented as \( P(D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both and normalization cancels it out when comparing the two probabilities:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Given:

\[ P(CS) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = 0.75 \]

This results in:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
