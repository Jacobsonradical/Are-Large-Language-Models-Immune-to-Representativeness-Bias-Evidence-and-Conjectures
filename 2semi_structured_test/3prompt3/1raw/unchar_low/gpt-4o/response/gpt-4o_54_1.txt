To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in its simplest form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description fitting Jason.

Given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since the description does not provide differentiating details that heavily favor one discipline over the other, assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \). This assumption simplifies the computation because if \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), then \( P(B) \) essentially cancels out in our Bayes' Theorem calculation, allowing us to directly compare the priors.

So:

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
