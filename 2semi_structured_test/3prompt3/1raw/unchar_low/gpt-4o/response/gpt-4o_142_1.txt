To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description about Jason.

We are seeking \( P(CS \mid D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly,
\[ P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

First, we calculate the priors:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Thus,
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description \( D \) is equally likely for academics from both computer science and humanities:
\[ P(D \mid CS) \approx P(D \mid H) \]

Since the prior (input data) does not give us reason to believe otherwise:
\[ P(D \mid CS) \approx P(D \mid H) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability simplifies to:
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

As a result, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
