To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**: The likelihood represents how probable it is to get the description given that Jason is a CS professor or a humanities professor. Since the description does not give us specific attributes strongly correlated with either discipline, we must assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 1
   \]

   Note: This assumes no bias in the description towards either discipline.

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is from the CS group given the description:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Since \(P(\text{Description})\) is equally likely across both groups, we only need the numerator, and we normalize by the total probability:

   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Since the likelihoods are equal, the overall equation simplifies to relying on the priors:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
