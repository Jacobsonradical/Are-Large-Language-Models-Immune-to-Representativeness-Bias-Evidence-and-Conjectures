Let's use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.

### Definitions:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- And \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since the description is chosen at random and no additional information about the probability of the description given each field is provided, we assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields, i.e., \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Therefore, \( P(D) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = k \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
