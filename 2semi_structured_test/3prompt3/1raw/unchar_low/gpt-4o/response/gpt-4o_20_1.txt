To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the description provided.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is from humanities is \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We do not have direct information about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \), the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is in either group. Generally, without additional information suggesting that one group is more or less likely to have these traits, we might consider the likelihoods to be roughly the same for simplicity.

Assuming \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities}) \), these terms would cancel out in Bayes' Theorem. Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) primarily depends on the prior probabilities:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}
\]

If we assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{Humanities}) \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\text{Humanities})}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

However, because we know they are tenured and successful professors, it may slightly suggest professors under these conditions share similar personality traits regardless of their field. Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
