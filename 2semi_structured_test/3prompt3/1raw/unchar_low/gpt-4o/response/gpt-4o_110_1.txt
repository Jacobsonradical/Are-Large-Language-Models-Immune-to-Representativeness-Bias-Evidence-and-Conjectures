To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of observing the description.

Given the problem setup:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

For simplicity, we assume the likelihood of having the described characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally probable among computer science and humanities professors, since we are not given information that these traits are more common in one group versus the other. Thus, we approximately have:

- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B| \text{not A}) \)

Since:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B| \text{not A}) \cdot P(\text{not A}) \]

And given \( P(B|A) \approx P(B| \text{not A}) \), the calculation simplifies to the prior:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\text{not A})}  \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is primarily influenced by the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
