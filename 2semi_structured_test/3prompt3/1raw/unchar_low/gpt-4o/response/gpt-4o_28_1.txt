Given that we have 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability (\(P(CS)\)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Conversely, the prior probability (\(P(H)\)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided does not give specific details that differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, such as specific interests or disciplines. Therefore, assuming the description is equally likely for both groups, we treat the likelihood of receiving this type of description given either group equally:

\[ P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \]

Since there is no specific information that makes one group more likely than the other given this description (i.e., neither group is more probable based on the description alone), the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science group remains proportional to their prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem, we update our belief considering the given description doesn't alter the likelihood in any skewed manner. Thus, the updated (posterior) probability \( P(CS | description) \) remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
