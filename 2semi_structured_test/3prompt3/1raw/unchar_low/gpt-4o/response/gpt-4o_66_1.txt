To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description and knowing the initial proportions, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

First, we need to consider the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(Hum) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's consider that the description mentions typical characteristics such as high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation, which might not strongly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. Since the problem doesn't specify any trait uniquely indicative of computer science or humanities professors, we assume both groups might equally display these traits.

Therefore, the likelihood of such a description given computer science \( P(Desc | CS) \) and given humanities \( P(Desc | Hum) \) are considered equal. Without loss of generality, assume they are both the same, say \( P(Desc | CS) = P(Desc | Hum) \). Thus, they will cancel each other out in Bayes' calculation.

Bayes' theorem simplifies in this case:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Since \( P(Desc | CS) = P(Desc | Hum) \):

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
