To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the formulation of the problem in terms of probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample is a computer science professor.
2. **Likelihood** \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of observing the given description (D) if Jason is a computer science professor.
3. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(D) \): The total probability of observing the given description across both groups.
4. **Posterior Probability** \( P(CS|D) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (what we want to calculate).

Let's denote the computer science professors by \( CS \) and the humanities professors by \( H \).

### Given:
- The number of computer science professors in the sample: \( n_{CS} = 25 \)
- The number of humanities professors in the sample: \( n_H = 75 \)
- Total number of professors: \( n_{total} = 100 \)

### Calculations:
**1. Prior Probability \( P(CS) \):**

\[ P(CS) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{total}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

**2. Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**

\[ P(H) = \frac{n_H}{n_{total}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**3. Likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):**

Since we don't have specific likelihood values given directly for the description, we will assume that the description is equally likely across both groups, meaning \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) could be considered the same for the given description. Therefore, 

\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

**4. Marginal Likelihood \( P(D) \):**

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]

Given the equal likelihood assumption:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \times P(CS) + k \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \times (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = k \times (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

where \( k \) is the constant representing the likelihood.

**5. Posterior Probability \( P(CS|D) \):**

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{k \times 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

So, given the description and the distribution of professors in the sample, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{{"probability": "0.25"}}} \]
