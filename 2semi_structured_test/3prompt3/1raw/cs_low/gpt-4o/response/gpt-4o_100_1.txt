First, let's apply Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}. \]

In this scenario:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Calculate \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:**
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Next, estimate \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason being described as he is given that he is a computer science professor:**
   - Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, align more with traits typically associated with computer science professors.
   - Let's assume it is likely, say 0.8.

4. **Estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of Jason being described as he is given that he is a humanities professor:**
   - Interest in coding and mathematical puzzles is less common among humanities professors.
   - Let's assume it is less likely, say 0.2.

5. **Compute \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description:**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

6. **Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571. \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.57"}
