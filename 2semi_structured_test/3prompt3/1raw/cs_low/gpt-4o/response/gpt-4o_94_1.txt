To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**: 
   - Probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)).
   - Probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging and does not enjoy drawing or writing, these traits are more typical of computer science professors. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.7 \) (since coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly tied to computer science).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (since these traits are less common in humanities).

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayes’ theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing the description.
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]

Calculating \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = (0.7 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.175 + 0.075 = 0.25
\]

Now applying Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.175}{0.25} = 0.7
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
