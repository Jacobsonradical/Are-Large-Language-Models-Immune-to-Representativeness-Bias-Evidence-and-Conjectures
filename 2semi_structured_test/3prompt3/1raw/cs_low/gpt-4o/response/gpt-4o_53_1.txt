To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description fits Jason.

Given:
- Prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor: \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability for Jason being a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor respectively.

Given the description, it matches more closely with traits generally associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Let’s estimate these likelihoods:

Assuming a higher likelihood for the description fitting a computer science professor, we can arbitrarily set:

\[
P(D|C) = 0.9
\]

And assuming a lower likelihood for the description fitting a humanities professor:

\[
P(D|H) = 0.2
\]

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
\]

Finally, compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{\text{{"probability": "0.6"}}}
\]
