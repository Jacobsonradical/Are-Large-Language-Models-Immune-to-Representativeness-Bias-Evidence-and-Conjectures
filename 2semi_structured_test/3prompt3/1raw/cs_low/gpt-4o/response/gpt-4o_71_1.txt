Given the description of Jason, let's use Bayes' theorem to update our probability that he is a computer science professor given the information provided.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \):
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (without any other information) is based on the proportion in the sample.
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability is:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \):
   - The likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description provided.
   - Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and other traits that align more traditionally with a computer science professor, we assign a high likelihood to this. Let's assume this likelihood is relatively high, say 0.9.

3. **Prior Probability of Humanities Professors**:
   - Similarly, the prior that Jason is a humanities professor is:
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

4. **Likelihood for Humanities Professors** \( P(B|H) \):
   - The likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description.
   - Given the description that aligns less with humanities interests (e.g., coding), let's assume this likelihood is relatively low, say 0.1.

5. **Total Probability** \( P(B) \):
   - This is the marginal likelihood of the description, which is a weighted sum of the likelihoods for both groups:
     \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|H)P(H) \]
     \[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, we can use these values to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
