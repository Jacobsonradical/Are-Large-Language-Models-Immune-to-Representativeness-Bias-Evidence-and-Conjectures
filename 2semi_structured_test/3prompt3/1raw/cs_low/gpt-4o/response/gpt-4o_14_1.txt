To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem mathematically describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here’s the step-by-step process for this calculation:

1. **Determine the base rates (priors):**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Evaluating the likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor (P(D|CS))
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor (P(D|H))

Given Jason's traits (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it is reasonable to assume that:
   - P(D|CS) is relatively high
   - P(D|H) is relatively low

For simplicity in this explanation and assuming that the traits described are strongly associated with computer science professors more than humanities professors, let’s assume:
   - P(D|CS) = 0.9
   - P(D|H) = 0.1

3. **Calculate the evidence (P(D)):**
   - P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H)
   - P(D) = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75)
   - P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075
   - P(D) = 0.3

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - P(CS|D) = \(\frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)}\)
   - P(CS|D) = \(\frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3}\)
   - P(CS|D) = \(\frac{0.225}{0.3}\)
   - P(CS|D) = 0.75

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
