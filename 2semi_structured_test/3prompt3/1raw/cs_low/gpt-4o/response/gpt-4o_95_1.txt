First, let's determine the prior probabilities. There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H) out of a total of 100 professors.

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods based on the commonality of the traits described. Let's denote the description by D.

We need to consider how likely it is that a description like Jason's belongs to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor:

- Coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more common among computer science professors.
- Jogging is neutral and could be equally likely among both groups.
- Highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing might fit better with computer science.

Thus, generally, the traits mentioned seem more aligned with what we would expect from a computer scientist rather than a humanities professor.

Let's denote:

\[
P(D | CS) \gg P(D | H)
\]

For simplicity, suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood) and \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the values we assumed:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{2}{3.5}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) \approx 0.57
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.57.
