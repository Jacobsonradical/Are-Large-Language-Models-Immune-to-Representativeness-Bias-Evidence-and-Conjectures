To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem involves prior probabilities and likelihoods to compute the posterior probability. Here's the breakdown of the components:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)) is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor (\(P(\text{description} | \text{CS})\)).
   - The likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor (\(P(\text{description} | \text{H})\)).

Given the description, characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging are more typical of a computer science professor. Therefore, we might reasonably assign higher likelihood to this fitting a computer science professor.

For simplification, assume rough likelihoods:
   - \(P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9\) (very likely)
   - \(P(\text{description} | \text{H}) = 0.1\) (less likely)

3. **Unconditional Probability of the Description (\(P(\text{description})\)):**
   - \(P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \times P(\text{H})\)
   - \(P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75\)
   - \(P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.075\)
   - \(P(\text{description}) = 0.3\)

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
   - \(P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}\)
   - \(P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3}\)
   - \(P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.225 / 0.3\)
   - \(P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.75\)

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
