To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason seems to fit more naturally with the typical interests and personality traits associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Let's denote the probability that a CS professor has Jason's description as \( P(D \mid CS) \).
   - Similarly, the probability that a humanities professor has Jason's description is \( P(D \mid H) \).

   Without explicit likelihood values, we must make an educated guess. Given the mentioned traits, it's reasonable to assume:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) \) is high (let's assume a reasonably high value like 0.80).
   - \( P(D \mid H) \) is lower (let's assume a lower value like 0.20).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]

4. **Calculation:**

   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.25}{(0.80 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.20}{(0.20) + (0.15)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.20}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.57
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.

Here is the answer in the required format:
