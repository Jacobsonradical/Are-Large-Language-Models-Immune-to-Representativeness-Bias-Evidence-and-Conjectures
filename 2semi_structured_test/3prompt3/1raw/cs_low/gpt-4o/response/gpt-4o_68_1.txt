To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description occurring in the sample.

Let's define our terms for this specific problem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \)** (that Jason is a humanities professor):
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \)** and \( P(B|A') \)**:
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A') \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. While we don't have exact probabilities for these likelihoods, we can reasonably assume that:

- \( P(B|A) \) (description fitting a computer science professor) is relatively high.
- \( P(B|A') \) (description fitting a humanities professor) is relatively low.

Let's make a rough estimate:
- Assume \( P(B|A) \) to be 0.9 (this means there is a high chance that a computer science professor fits Jason's description).
- Assume \( P(B|A') \) to be 0.2 (there is a low chance that a humanities professor fits Jason's description).

4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The total probability of Jason's description, which can be calculated as:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
