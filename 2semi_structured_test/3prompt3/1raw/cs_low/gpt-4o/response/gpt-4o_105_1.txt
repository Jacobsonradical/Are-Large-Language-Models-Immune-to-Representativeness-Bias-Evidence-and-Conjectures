To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence provided by Jason's description.

1. **P(A**): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **P(B|A)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of computer science professors. Let's assume a higher probability for this, say:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

3. **P(\neg A)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

4. **P(B|\neg A)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Jason's activities and interests (e.g., coding and mathematical puzzles) are less typical of humanities professors. Let's assume a lower probability for this, say:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

5. **P(B)**: The total probability of Jason's description. This can be calculated by:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to find:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
