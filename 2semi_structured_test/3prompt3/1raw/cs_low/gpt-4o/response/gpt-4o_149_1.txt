To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Given:
- The study interviewed 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors interviewed is 100.

Prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given the two categories (computer science vs. humanities). 

From Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators for a computer science professor.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be less common among humanities professors.

We can subjectively estimate that Jason's description makes it much more likely that he is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let’s assign:
- Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor, P(Description|CS) = 0.9
- Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor, P(Description|Hum) = 0.1

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) * P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) * P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
