To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The prior probability and the likelihood of observing the given description can be used to calculate the posterior probability.

### Information:
- 25 computer science professors (CS)
- 75 humanities professors (H)
- Total: 100 professors

#### Prior Probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

#### Description Likelihood:
The description provided contains several traits that might be more common in computer science professors than in humanities professors (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). For simplicity, let's assume the following likelihoods based on these traits:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9 \) (very likely given the traits)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1 \) (less likely given the traits)

#### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now calculate the posterior:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
