To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We are given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors (CS).
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors (H).
- Jason is randomly chosen from these 100 professors.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description, given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description, given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be expanded using the law of total probability: \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given the description of Jason:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging.
- Highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These characteristics seem to align more with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We will assume the likelihood probabilities based on this description as follows:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (assuming a high likelihood that a computer science professor would fit this description).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (assuming a low likelihood that a humanities professor would fit this description).

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Hence the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
