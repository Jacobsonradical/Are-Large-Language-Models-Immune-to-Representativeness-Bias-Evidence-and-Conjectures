To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the description across all professors.

First, we need to determine our prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., a humanities professor), is:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To use Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (traits more likely associated with computer science), let's assign this a high probability, say 0.9.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Since his interests are less common in humanities, we'll assign a lower probability, say 0.3.

Next, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.225 = 0.45 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.45} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.45} = 0.5 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
