To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**  
   - Let \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(Hum) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:  
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]  
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let \( P(Desc|CS) \) be the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(Desc|Hum) \) be the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Given the description (Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it is more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(Desc|CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc|Hum) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**  
   Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS|Desc) \) is given by:

   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
