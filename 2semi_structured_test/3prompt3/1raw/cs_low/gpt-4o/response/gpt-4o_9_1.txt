First, let's consider the base rates of the two groups:

- Number of professors in computer science (CS): 25
- Number of professors in the humanities: 75

Therefore, the base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science field is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's analyze Jason's description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science professors.
- Jason enjoys jogging, which doesn't particularly favor either group.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be associated more with the humanities.

Given this information, it seems more likely that Jason could be one of the computer science professors due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are less common in humanities.

Bayes' theorem can help us update our belief. However, without specific likelihood ratios for these traits, we can reason qualitatively that the traits Jason exhibits are more likely associated with computer science than humanities.

Since Jason's traits align more with the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, I will lean more towards computer science. However, since the base rate for humanities is three times that of computer science, we need to be careful not to overstate the shift.

Given the dominance of computer science-related interests in Jason's description, a reasonable posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be somewhere close to 0.7. This considers the base rate and the specific alignment of his interests with that of computer science.
