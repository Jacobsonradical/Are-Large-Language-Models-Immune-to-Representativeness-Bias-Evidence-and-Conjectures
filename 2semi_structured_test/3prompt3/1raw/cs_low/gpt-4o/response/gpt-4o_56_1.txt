Let's compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A^c) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \).

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \), the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests and attributes such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it seems more likely that he would be a computer science professor. While we don't have exact probabilities, it is reasonable to assume:

- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor, is relatively high. Let's assume a value such as 0.8 for estimation.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor, is lower. Let's assume a value such as 0.2 for estimation.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the description \( B \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
