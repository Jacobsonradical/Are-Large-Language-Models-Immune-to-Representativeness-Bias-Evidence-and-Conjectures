To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The observed description of Jason.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the observed description.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate each term:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**:
   - This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
   - We'll assume a relatively high likelihood, say 0.9, since the description strongly aligns with common traits of computer science professors.

3. **Prior Probability of Humanities Professors (\( P(\neg A) \))**:
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

4. **Likelihood for Humanities (\( P(B|\neg A) \))**:
   - This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Given the description, it seems less likely for a humanities professor because coding and mathematical puzzles are not typically associated with the humanities.
   - We'll assume a lower likelihood, say 0.1.

Using these values, we calculate the evidence \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.75" \]
