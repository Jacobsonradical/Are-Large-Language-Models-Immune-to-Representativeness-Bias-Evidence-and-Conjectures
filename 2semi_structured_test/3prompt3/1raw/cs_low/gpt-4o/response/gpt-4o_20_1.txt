To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem relates current probability (prior probability) to new evidence (likelihood).

We need to calculate:

\[ P(CS | D) \]

Where:
- \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( D \) is the given description of Jason

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's define each component:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(CS) \):
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood** \( P(D | CS) \):
   The probability that a computer science professor would match Jason's description. Given his interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, let's assume this likelihood is high, say 0.9 (we assume high alignment based on typical computer science interests).

3. **Likelihood** \( P(D | H) \) where \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor:
   The probability that a humanities professor would match Jason's description. Given his described interests, letâ€™s assume this likelihood is low, say 0.1.

4. **Marginal likelihood** \( P(D) \):
   This is a normalization factor that ensures the probabilities sum to 1.
   
   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
