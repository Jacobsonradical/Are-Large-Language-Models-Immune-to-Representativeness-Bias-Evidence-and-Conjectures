Given this scenario, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability \( P(CS) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - Prior probability \( P(Hum) \) of Jason being a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to define the likelihoods based on the description. Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) and personality traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, highly creative but not into drawing or writing) seem to align more with a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor.

   Let’s assume:
   - \( P(Description | CS) = 0.9 \)
   - \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.1 \)

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, given by:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)
   \]

   So:
   \[
   P(Description) = 0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

4. **Calculation**:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
