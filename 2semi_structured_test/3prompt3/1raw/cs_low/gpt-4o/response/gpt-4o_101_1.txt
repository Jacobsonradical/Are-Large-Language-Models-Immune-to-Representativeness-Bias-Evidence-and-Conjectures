To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define our events:
- Let \(A = \) Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \(B = \) The given description.

We need to determine each of these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\):**

Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors,
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \(P(\neg A)\):**

This is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor (the complement).
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \]

3. **Conditional Probability \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):**

Given the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, but not drawing or writing), it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

It can be assumed that:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor) is high, say 0.8.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor) is low, say 0.2.

4. **Overall Probability \(P(B)\):**

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
