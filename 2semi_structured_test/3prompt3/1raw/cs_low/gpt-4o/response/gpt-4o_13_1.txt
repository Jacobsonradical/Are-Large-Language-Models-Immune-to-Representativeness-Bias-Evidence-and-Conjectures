To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we can outline the prior probabilities:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- And the probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood that Jason is described as a computer science professor, given the description. Based on the description (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging), it seems more stereotypically aligned with computer science attributes. Let's assume this likelihood is relatively high, say \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

- \( P(B|A') \): The likelihood that Jason is described as a humanities professor, given the description. Given that the description is less aligned with the stereotypical humanities professor, we assume this likelihood is lower, say \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \).

Finally, we calculate the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A') \times P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.6.
