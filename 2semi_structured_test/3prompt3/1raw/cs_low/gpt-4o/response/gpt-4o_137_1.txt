To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description among all professors.

First, let's break down these components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**: The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science professors, we'll assume this probability is high. Let’s denote it as \( P(B | CS) \).
   For this example, let's assume this probability conceptually (e.g., \( P(B | CS) = 0.8 \)) given the traits fit well.

4. **Likelihood \( P(B | A^c) \)**: The probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor. Given the specificity of enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles (less common in humanities), this probability is likely lower. Let's denote it as \( P(B | Hum) \).
   For this example, let's assume this probability conceptually (e.g., \( P(B | Hum) = 0.2 \)).

5. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**: The total probability of the description among all professors, calculated using the law of total probability.
   \[ P(B) = P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(CS | B) ≈ 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571. 

The formatted answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
