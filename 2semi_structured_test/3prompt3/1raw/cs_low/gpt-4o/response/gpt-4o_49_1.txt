To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information given:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a professor is in computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a professor is in the humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description of Jason, we need to estimate the likelihood of such a profile given the professor is in computer science \( P(D|CS) \) and the likelihood of such a profile given the professor is in the humanities \( P(D|H) \). 

Based on the given traits:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests a higher likelihood of being in computer science.
- Enjoys jogging could be neutral.
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing further supports a higher likelihood of being in computer science.

We assume: 
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively higher, let’s say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively lower, let’s say \( 0.2 \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{4}{7} = 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
