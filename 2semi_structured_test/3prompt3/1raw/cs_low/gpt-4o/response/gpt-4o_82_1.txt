To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior \( P(A) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \).

\( P(B) \) is derived using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\lnot A) \cdot P(\lnot A) \]

Where:
- \( P(\lnot A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, which is \( 75/100 = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\lnot A) \) are the probabilities of the description given that the professor is in computer science or humanities, respectively.

Given the description of Jason (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, high creativity, does not enjoy drawing or writing), it's reasonable to assume that such traits are more common among computer science professors. Thus, we expect that:
\[ P(B|A) > P(B|\lnot A) \]

However, exact values for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\lnot A) \) are not provided by the study, so we’ll reason it out qualitatively, assuming that this description significantly favors Jason being a computer science professor.

We'll assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood given Jason’s traits match computer science profiles)
- \( P(B|\lnot A) \approx 0.2 \) (low likelihood given Jason’s traits are less typical for humanities professors)

Using these values:
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Now calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
