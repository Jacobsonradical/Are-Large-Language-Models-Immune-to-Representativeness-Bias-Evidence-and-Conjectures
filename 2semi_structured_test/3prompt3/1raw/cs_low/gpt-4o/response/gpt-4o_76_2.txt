To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given:
- 25 computer science professors.
- 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description fits certain stereotypes of a computer science professor better due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science professors given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is from the computer science professors.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that randomly selected Jason is from the computer science professors.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description (regardless of his field).

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \] (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \] (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

Without exact figures, we assume that Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles significantly increases \( P(B|A) \) compared to \( P(B|\neg A) \). Let's denote:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood that a computer science professor has Jason's description)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \) (lower likelihood that a humanities professor has Jason's description)

Now, use the law of total probability to determine \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
