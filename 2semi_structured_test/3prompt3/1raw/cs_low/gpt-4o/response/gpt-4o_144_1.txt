To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information given:

- Total professors: 100
  - Computer Science professors: 25
  - Humanities professors: 75

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting such a description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

Given:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor)

Assuming Jason's description seems more aligned with a computer science professor (due to his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and lack of interest in drawing or writing), we can infer \( P(B|A) \) to be higher than \( P(B|A^c) \):

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the probability of such characteristics if Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (the probability of such characteristics if Jason is a humanities professor)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
