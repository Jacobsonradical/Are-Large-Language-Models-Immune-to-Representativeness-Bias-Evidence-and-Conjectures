To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, identify the relevant probabilities:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, evaluate how likely the given description ("conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious...enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging...highly creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing") fits computer science professors versus humanities professors. 

Given Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems much more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. For the sake of calculation, let’s hypothesize the following:
- Probability of this description for computer science professors (P(D|CS)): Given the description, it is likely, so let’s assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (90%).
- Probability of this description for humanities professors (P(D|H)): Given the description, it is unlikely, so let’s assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plug in the values:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.75 \).

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
