First, let's identify the relevant information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- One professor's description is chosen at random from 100 descriptions.

Now, using Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, we need to account for:
- The prior probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|Hum)\), where \(D\) is the detailed personality description.

Given the detail about enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, it seems more probable that the description could fit a computer science professor. Let's make an informed estimation:
- Suppose \(P(D|CS)\) is quite high, say 0.9, because these activities and preferences are strongly associated with computer science.
- Suppose \(P(D|Hum)\) is lower, say 0.2, because these activities and preferences are less associated with the humanities.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
