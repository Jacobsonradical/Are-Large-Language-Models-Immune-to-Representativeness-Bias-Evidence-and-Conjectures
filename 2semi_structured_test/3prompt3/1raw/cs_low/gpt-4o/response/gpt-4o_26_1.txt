To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- **C**: Jason is a computer science professor
- **H**: Jason is a humanities professor
- **D**: The given description of Jason

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Firstly, let's determine \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(C) = \frac{\# \text{ of computer science professors}}{\# \text{ of total professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

\[ P(H) = \frac{\# \text{ of humanities professors}}{\# \text{ of total professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), i.e., the likelihoods of the description given Jason is from either group. Since the description seems more typical of someone in the computer science field (due to mention of coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we can make an educated guess:

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \)

These assumptions reflect our judgment that the description is more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.5714.
