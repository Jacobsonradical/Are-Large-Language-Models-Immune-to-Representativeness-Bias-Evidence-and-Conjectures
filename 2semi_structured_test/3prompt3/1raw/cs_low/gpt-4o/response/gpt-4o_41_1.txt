To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (Jason's description).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|C) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

We know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate \( P(E|C) \) and \( P(E|H) \):

Given the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not drawing or writing), it seems more stereotypically aligned with traits we might associate with a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Let's estimate these likelihoods based on the description:
- We can assume that if Jason is a computer science professor, the likelihood of the evidence \( P(E|C) \) is quite high, let's say \( P(E|C) = 0.9 \).
- If Jason is a humanities professor, the likelihood of the same evidence \( P(E|H) \) might be lower, let's say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
