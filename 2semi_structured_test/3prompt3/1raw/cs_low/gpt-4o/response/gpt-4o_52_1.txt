To evaluate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can employ Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

### Initial Probabilities
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. Given 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample pool of 100 professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Complement Probability
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is not a computer science professor (i.e., is a humanities professor):
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihoods
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor. Given the traits described (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.), it's reasonable to assign a high probability, say:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor. These traits (especially coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are less typical for humanities professors, so let's assign a lower probability, say:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

### Total Probability of \( B \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ = 0.3 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

\[ \text{{{"probability": "0.75"}}} \]
