To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100, so \(P(CS) = 0.25\).
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H))\): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100, so \(P(H) = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \(P(description | CS)\): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given the traits like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, this is probably quite high, let's assume it is \(0.9\) (90% of computer science professors might fit this description).
   - \(P(description | H)\): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. While some humanities professors might enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it might be less likely, let's assume it is \(0.1\).

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.75\).
