To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description among all professors.

Let's define the terms specifically for our case:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( \neg A \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) = The description provided (Jason's characteristics).

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):**
   - There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   - This part is more subjective and relies on interpreting the given description. Given the traits such as an interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and the lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are more typical for a CS professor compared to a humanities professor, we can reasonably assign probabilities here.

   For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
   - \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (There is a high probability that a CS professor matches Jason's description)
   - \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (There is a low probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description)

3. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \):**
   - Using the law of total probability,
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, Jason has around a 57.1% chance of being one of the computer science professors given the provided description.

Thus, your answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.57"}
