To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) assuming Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a professor chosen at random is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a professor chosen at random is from humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
- The description mentions characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles which are more stereotypical of computer science professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is quite high, let's estimate it as 0.8.
- \( P(D | H) \) is lower, let's estimate it as 0.2 due to the nature of the hobbies mentioned.

Now, we need to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
