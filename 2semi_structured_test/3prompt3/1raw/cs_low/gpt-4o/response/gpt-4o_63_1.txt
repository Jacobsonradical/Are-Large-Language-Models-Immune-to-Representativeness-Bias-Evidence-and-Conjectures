To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, let's denote \( P(D|A) \) as the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|B) \) as the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

We need to estimate these probabilities based on the description. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is more likely that he would belong to the computer science group. Thus, we might assign relatively high value to \( P(D|A) \) and relatively low value to \( P(D|B) \). For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:

- \( P(D|A) = 0.9 \) (highly likely a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(D|B) = 0.1 \) (less likely a humanities professor fits this description)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(A|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \times P(A)}{P(D|A) \times P(A) + P(D|B) \times P(B)} \]

Substituting our values, we get:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
