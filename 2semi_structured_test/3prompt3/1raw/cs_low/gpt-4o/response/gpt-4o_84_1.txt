Let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) = the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability)
- \( P(D | CS) \) = the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(CS) \) = the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D) \) = the total probability of the description

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to assess \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Humanities) \).

Based on the description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: These traits are more likely for computer science professors.
- Despite being highly creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing: This supports the idea that he might be in computer science as those in humanities typically enjoy writing.

Now, assuming we have no exact probabilities, we can assign subjective probabilities based on the description matching more with computer science professors:

- Let's assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) 
- Let's assume \( P(D | Humanities) = 0.1 \) 

To calculate \( P(D) \), we combine both scenarios:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) * P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 * 0.25 + 0.1 * 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

{"probability": "0.75"}
