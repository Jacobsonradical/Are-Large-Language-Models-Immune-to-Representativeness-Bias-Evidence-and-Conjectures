To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we need to update our prior beliefs based on the information provided.

**Bayes' theorem** in this context is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Our prior probabilities, based on the sample:
- \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (Jason is a humanities professor)

Next, we estimate \( P(B|A) \) for computer science and humanities based on the description:

Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (often more aligned with the stereotype of computer science professors), it seems highly probable that he is a computer science professor. His lack of interest in drawing or writing further aligns with this.

Let's assign:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high, as the description matches typical activities of computer science professors)
- \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0.2 \) (low, these traits are less characteristic of humanities professors)

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
