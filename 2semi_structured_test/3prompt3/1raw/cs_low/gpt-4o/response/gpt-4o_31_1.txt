To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we'll apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's outline the given information:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
- Jason is one of the 100 professors.

We need to determine:
\[ P(CS|D) \]
where D is the description of Jason.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability of being a CS professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given a CS professor.

Letâ€™s make the calculations step-by-step:

1. Prior probability \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Prior probability \( P(H) \):
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. Probability of the description \( D \) given CS (P(D|CS)):

Given the description matches typical attributes of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving puzzles), it's reasonable to assume that P(D|CS) is high, say around 0.9.

4. Probability of the description \( D \) given H (P(D|H)):

Considering the description is less typical for a humanities professor, P(D|H) might be lower, say around 0.2.

5. Total probability \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

6. Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.6"} \]
