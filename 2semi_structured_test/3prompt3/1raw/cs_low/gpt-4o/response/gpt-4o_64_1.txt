To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence. 

First, let’s outline the relevant information:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem is defined as:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Let’s start with the priors:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (where \( H \) stands for humanities professors)

Considering the given description of Jason:
- He enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These traits are more closely aligned with common stereotypes about computer science professors rather than humanities professors.

Let’s denote:
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description being given for a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of the description being given for a humanities professor.

Given the description, it is reasonable to assume that:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.9.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low, say 0.1.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
