To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

where:
- \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(CS) \)):
   Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Similarly,
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   Based on the description provided, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and joggingâ€”activities that are typically more common among computer science professors. The description seems to align more with a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, let us assume for the sake of calculation:
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid CS) = 0.8 \quad \text{(high likelihood for CS professors)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.2 \quad \text{(less likely for humanities professors)}
   \]

3. **Total Probability of the Description** (\( P(\text{description}) \)):
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   Applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.25)}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{20}{35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.571"
\]
