To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the information given:

- Number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

From the problem description, we need to find \(P(\text{CS} | \text{Description})\).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}\]

First, let's break down each part of the equation:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(\text{CS})\)**: This is the prior probability that a professor comes from the computer science field, which is:
\[P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

2. **Prior Probability \(P(\text{H})\)**: This is the prior probability that a professor comes from the humanities field, which is:
\[P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

3. **Likelihood \(P(\text{Description}| \text{CS})\)**: This is the probability that Jason's description matches a computer science professor. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging – activities common among computer science professors – we can reasonably assume this likelihood is high. Let's denote it as \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9\).

4. **Likelihood \(P(\text{Description}| \text{H})\)**: This is the probability that Jason's description matches a humanities professor. Since the traits like enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are less common among humanities professors, this likelihood might be lower. Let's denote it as \(P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 0.1\).

5. **Marginal Probability \(P(\text{Description})\)**: This is the total probability of the description, which is calculated as:
\[P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}| \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}| \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})\]
\[P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)\]
\[P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075\]
\[P(\text{Description}) = 0.3\]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}\]
\[P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3}\]
\[P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3}\]
\[P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.75\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
