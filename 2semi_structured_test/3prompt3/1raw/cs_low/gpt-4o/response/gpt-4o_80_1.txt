To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description, regardless of his field.

Let's define the variables:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Jason's description.

First, we calculate \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Because Jason's description includes interests and traits that may be more typical of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), we can assume that \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high. Suppose \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- Jason's description is less typical for a humanities professor, so \( P(B|\neg A) \) would be lower. Suppose \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
