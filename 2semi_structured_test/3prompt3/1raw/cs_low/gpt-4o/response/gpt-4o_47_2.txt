To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \) for computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25.
- \( P(H) \) for humanities professors is 75/100 = 0.75.

Now consider the description. Jason has attributes that are stereotypically more associated with computer science (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles). Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|C) \)) is higher than the probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).

Letâ€™s assign these conditional probabilities plausible values:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \) (high because the description fits a CS professor well).
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (low because the description is less typical for a humanities professor).

To find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
