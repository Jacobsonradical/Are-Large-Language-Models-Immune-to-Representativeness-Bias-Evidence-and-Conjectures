To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll start with the relevant information:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** The initial probability of a professor being from computer science.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability (P(Hum)):** The initial probability of a professor being from the humanities.
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(Desc|CS)) and P(Desc|Hum):** The probabilities of the given description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor respectively. This requires subjective estimation based on the description.

Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, conservative, careful, talented, ambitious), it seems quite likely that Jason is a computer science professor, as these hobbies and traits align more closely with computer science.

Let's assign some estimated likelihood values:
- P(Desc|CS): Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor. Let's say this is high, around 0.9.
- P(Desc|Hum): Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor. This might be lower, say around 0.2, as these traits and interests are not as commonly associated with the humanities.

4. **Bayes' Theorem:** 
\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{(0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)}
\]
\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15}
\]
\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(CS|Desc) = 0.6
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.6"}
\]
