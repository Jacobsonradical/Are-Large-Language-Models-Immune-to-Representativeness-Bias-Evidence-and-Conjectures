To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

### Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### 1. Prior Probability \( P(A) \)
We know the sample consists of:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

So, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

#### 2. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)
We need to consider how likely Jason's description is given that he is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align well with common interests in the computer science field.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \]

#### 3. Total Probability \( P(B) \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A) \]

where \( P(¬A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(¬A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We should estimate \( P(B|¬A) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Given the alignment with common computer science interests, let's assume:
\[ P(B|¬A) \approx 0.2 \]

Now we can calculate the total probability:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

#### 4. Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)
Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

### Final Answer
{"probability": "0.571"}
