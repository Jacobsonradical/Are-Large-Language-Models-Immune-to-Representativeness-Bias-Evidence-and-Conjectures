To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches the given profile.

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason's description.

### 1. Prior Probability \( P(A) \)

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total: 100 professors.

The prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### 2. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which seems more typical of a computer science professor. While we don't have exact numbers for how likely each trait is in either group, the description seems consistent with typical traits of a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) of this description given a computer science professor: Since the description fits, let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

### 3. Total Probability \( P(B) \)

To find the total probability \( P(B) \), we need to consider both groups:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., a humanities professor).

- Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) of being a humanities professor:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \) of the description given a humanities professor: As the description is less typical for a humanities professor, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

### Calculate Posterior Probability

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
