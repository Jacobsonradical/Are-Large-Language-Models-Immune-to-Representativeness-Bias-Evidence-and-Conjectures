To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \): Jason's description matches the given profile.

The prior probabilities are given as follows:
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\( P(A) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (\( P(A^c) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): Overall probability of the description.

Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. We hypothetically assign higher likelihoods:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (Jason is likely to be a computer science professor given his interest in coding and puzzles.)
- \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \) (Jason is less likely to be a humanities professor given his specific interests.)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
