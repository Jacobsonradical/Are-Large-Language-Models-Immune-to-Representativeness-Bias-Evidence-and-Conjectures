To update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason matches the given description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that Jason is a CS professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities (H) professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need:
1. \( P(B|A) \) = Probability that a CS professor matches the description.
2. \( P(B|\neg A) \) = Probability that a humanities professor matches the description.
3. \( P(B) \) = Total probability that Jason matches the description across both groups.

Assume the features described (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, conservative, ambitious) are more typical of CS professors than humanities professors. For simplicity, let's estimate:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood he fits the CS profile)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood he fits the humanities profile)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} \]

Calculating:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.

Here's the formatted answer:
