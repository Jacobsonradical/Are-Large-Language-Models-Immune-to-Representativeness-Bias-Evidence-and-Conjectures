To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence.

First, we need to set up the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description under each category (computer science professor vs. humanities professor).

### Prior Probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities)

### Likelihoods:
Next, let's consider the likelihood of the description fitting each type of professor. The description mentions qualities (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) that are stereotypically more common in computer science professors than in humanities professors. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) = High (e.g., 0.9)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \) = Low (e.g., 0.1)

### Posterior Probability:
Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS |\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) * P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]
Where:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) * P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) * P(H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS |\text{description}) = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
