To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's personality description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing Jason's personality description.

Let's break this down:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. This is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, it appears he enjoys activities typically associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). We can assume this probability is relatively high. For this example, let's use an arbitrary high value of 0.8.

4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Based on the description, it seems less likely but possible. For this example, let's use an arbitrary low value of 0.2.

5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of observing Jason's description, which combines both groups:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57, or 57%.
