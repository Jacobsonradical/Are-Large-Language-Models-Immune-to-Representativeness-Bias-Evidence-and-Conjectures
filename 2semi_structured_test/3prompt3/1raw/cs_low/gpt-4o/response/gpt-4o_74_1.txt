Let's use Bayes' theorem to update our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, we define our prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) = 75/100 = 0.75

The description provided does seem more indicative of a computer science professor based on interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and lack of interest in writing and drawing. Let's approximate the likelihoods given the description:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \): Let's assume there's a high probability that the description matches a computer science professor, say 0.9.
- \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \): Let's assume the description matches a humanities professor with a low probability, say 0.1.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \):

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

We need to find \( P(\text{description}) \), the total probability of the description, which is given by:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75
\]
\[
P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now, we can find the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

"probability": "0.75"
