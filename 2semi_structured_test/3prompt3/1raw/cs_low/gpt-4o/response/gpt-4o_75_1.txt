To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description across all professors.

Let's input the values step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   Given Jason's description—enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Assuming conditional probabilities:

   - Suppose \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (likelihood Jason has such traits if he is a computer science professor).
   - Suppose \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (likelihood Jason has such traits if he is a humanities professor).

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   The total probability of Jason’s description can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) 
   = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
   = 0.2 + 0.15
   = 0.35
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
   = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
   = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
   \approx 0.571
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
