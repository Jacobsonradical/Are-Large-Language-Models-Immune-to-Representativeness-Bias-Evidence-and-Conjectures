To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Here's how we arrive at the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description.

Firstly, let's define the variables:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (Hum) = 75

Prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To find \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \), we need to assess the likelihood of Jasonâ€™s description fitting computer science versus humanities professors. Given Jason's traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, dislike for drawing or writing), it seems more likely these would align with a computer science professor.

For this illustration, let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(D|Hum) = 0.2 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.25)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
