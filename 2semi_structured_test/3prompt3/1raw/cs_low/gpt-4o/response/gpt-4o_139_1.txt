To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting the description for any professor.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \( B \) as the event "Description fits Jason."

First, calculate \( P(A) \), the prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, calculate \( P(B) \):
- This is the combined probability of the description among both computer science and humanities professors.

We need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\text{not }A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason’s description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\text{not }A) \) is the probability that Jason’s description fits a humanities professor.

Based on the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, does not enjoy drawing or writing), it is more likely to fit a computer science professor’s profile.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (since the description fits the profile of a computer science professor well)
- \( P(B|\text{not }A) = 0.2 \) (since the description does not fit the typical profile of a humanities professor well)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not }A) \cdot P(\text{not }A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.5714.
