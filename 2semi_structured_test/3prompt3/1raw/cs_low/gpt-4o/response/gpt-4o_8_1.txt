To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description across all professors.

Let's identify and calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \) (Jason being a humanities professor)**
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**
   - The likelihood is the probability of observing Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Given the description includes traits commonly associated with computer science (coding, enjoying mathematical puzzles), \(P(B|A)\) is likely higher.
   - For simplicity, let's assume a higher likelihood, such as \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**
   - The likelihood of observing Jason's description given he is a humanities professor is lower given the emphasis on coding and mathematical puzzles.
   - Again, for simplicity, let's assume a lower likelihood, such as \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)** using the Law of Total Probability
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
