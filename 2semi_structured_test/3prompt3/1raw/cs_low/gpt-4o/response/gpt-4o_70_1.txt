To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We'll start by identifying some necessary components:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The description seems more fitting for a computer science professor due to Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, which may be more common in that field. We need to estimate the likelihood that a computer science professor matches Jason's description (\(P(D \mid CS)\)) compared to a humanities professor matching it (\(P(D \mid H)\)).

   - Letâ€™s assume:
     - \(P(D \mid CS) = 0.7\) (70% of computer science professors match the description)
     - \(P(D \mid H) = 0.2\) (20% of humanities professors match the description)

3. **Marginal probability of the description (\(P(D)\)):**
   - \(P(D) = P(D \mid CS)P(CS) + P(D \mid H)P(H)\)
   - \(P(D) = (0.7 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)\)
   - \(P(D) = 0.175 + 0.15 = 0.325\)

4. **Posterior probability \(P(CS \mid D)\):**
   - Using Bayes' theorem: \(P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS)P(CS)}{P(D)}\)
   - \(P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{0.325}\)
   - \(P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.175}{0.325}\)
   - \(P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.5385\)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:
