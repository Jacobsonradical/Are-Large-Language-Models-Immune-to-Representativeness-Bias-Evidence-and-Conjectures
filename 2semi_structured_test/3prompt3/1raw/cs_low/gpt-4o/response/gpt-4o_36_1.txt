To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes’ Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

First, let us define our variables:
- \( A \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): Description of Jason

We aim to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
- \( P(B) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
- \( P(D|A) \): Likelihood of the description D given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|B) \): Likelihood of the description D given that Jason is a humanities professor

Assuming the description matches the attributes of a computer science professor more closely (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we'll make a qualitative assumption:
- \( P(D|A) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D|B) \) is relatively low.

Since we aren't given actual numerical values for \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \), let's assume a reasonable set of likelihoods for estimation:
- \( P(D|A) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|B) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor)

Calculate \( P(D) \) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.57"}
