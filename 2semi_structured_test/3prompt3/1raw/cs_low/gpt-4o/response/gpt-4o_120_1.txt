To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We start with the given information:

1. There are 100 professors in total: 25 in computer science (CS) and 75 in the humanities (H).
2. We are provided with Jason's description and need to update our prior beliefs based on this information.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's determine \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is talented, ambitious, and avoids writing.
- These traits are more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

So we assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low. Let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
