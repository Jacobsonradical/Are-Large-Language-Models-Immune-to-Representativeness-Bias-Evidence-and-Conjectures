To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

From the problem, we have:
- There are 25 tenured computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is from computer science is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^\text{c}) \) that Jason is from the humanities is:
\[ P(A^\text{c}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we must consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^\text{c}) \). The description seems to align more closely with attributes typically associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) versus humanities professors. While not exact, we can estimate these likelihoods:

- Let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (highly likely for a CS professor).
- Let's assume \( P(B|A^\text{c}) \approx 0.1 \) (less likely for a humanities professor).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^\text{c}) \cdot P(A^\text{c}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Now we can compute \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.727" \} \]
