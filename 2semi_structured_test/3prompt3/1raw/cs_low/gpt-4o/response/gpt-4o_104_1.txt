Given the description of Jason, we are trying to estimate the posterior probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample. 

We will use Bayes' Theorem to find this probability. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\( A \) is the event that he is a computer science professor and \( B \) is the event of the given description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description,

We know from the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The prior \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the description, Jason seems to have interests and traits that align more with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Thus, we will assume that \( P(B|A) \) is high. In contrast, assuming the descriptions are equally descriptive of humanities professors is low but not impossible.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (80% chance a computer science professor fits this description).
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance a humanities professor fits this description).

We now calculate \( P(B) \) as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the description in both groups:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.5714.
