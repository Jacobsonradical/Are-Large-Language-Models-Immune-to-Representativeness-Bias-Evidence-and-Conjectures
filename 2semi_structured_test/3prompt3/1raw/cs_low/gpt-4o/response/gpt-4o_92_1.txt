To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to find \( P(C | \text{Description}) \).

First, we should consider the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of the total 100, so \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- There are 75 humanities professors out of the total 100, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we compare the likelihoods that Jason, with the given description, is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description mentions an interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seems more aligned with traits typical of a computer science professor.

While we don't have exact likelihood values for \( P(\text{Description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \), we can make an educated guess based on the nature of the activities mentioned:

- It is reasonable to assume that being interested in coding and solving mathematical puzzles is much more common among computer science professors than among humanities professors.
  
Let us assume that \( P(\text{Description} | C) = 0.8 \) and \( P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.1 \).

Therefore, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting in the assumed values:

\[
P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.2
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
\]

Thus:

\[
P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

So, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727. Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.727"}
