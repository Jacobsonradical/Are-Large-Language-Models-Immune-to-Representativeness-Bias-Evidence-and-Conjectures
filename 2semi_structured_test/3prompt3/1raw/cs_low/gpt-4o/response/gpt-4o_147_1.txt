To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

The theorem is expressed as: 

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (A) given his description (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he's a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the description belongs to a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jason's description.

Let's define these terms for our problem:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \)**: (that Jason is in the humanities)
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - So, \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - We consider the traits in Jasonâ€™s description: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with a computer science background. 
   - Suppose the likelihood here is relatively high, say \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \)**: 
   - For a humanities professor, these traits are less common.
   - We might set a lower likelihood value, say \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \).

Now, we calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') \]

Using the provided likely values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 * 0.25) + (0.2 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 * 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571 (or 57.1%).

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.571"}
