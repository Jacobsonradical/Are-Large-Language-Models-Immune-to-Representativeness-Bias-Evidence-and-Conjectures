To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find each part of this formula:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):**
   - \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Though these exact probabilities are not provided, based on the description, it's reasonable to consider that Jason’s interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing) align more closely with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We can consider they may be substantially different. Hence, let’s assume \(P(D|C) \gg P(D|H)\). Let's assume that \( P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(D) \):**
   - We can calculate \( P(D) \) as the total probability of the description, combining both cases (computer science and humanities).
   - \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - Using the assumed likelihoods: \( P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \)

Putting these together:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
