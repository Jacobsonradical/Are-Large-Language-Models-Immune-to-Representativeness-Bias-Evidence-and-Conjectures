To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the problem first:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor in the sample is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor in the sample is from the humanities (\( P(Hum) \)):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D \mid CS) \)):
     
     Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities common among computer scientists, let's reasonably assume this to be high. For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.9 \).

   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D \mid Hum) \)):
     
     Given the nature of the description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), these traits are less typical for humanities professors. We'll assume this to be much lower. For simplicity, we'll assume \( P(D \mid Hum) = 0.1 \).

3. **Posterior probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem, we compute the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \) as follows:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{ P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum) }
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{ 0.9 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 }
   \]

   Calculating the numerator:
   \[
   0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.225
   \]

   Calculating the denominator:
   \[
   0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{ 0.225 }{ 0.3 } = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \), formatted as:

{"probability": "0.75"}
