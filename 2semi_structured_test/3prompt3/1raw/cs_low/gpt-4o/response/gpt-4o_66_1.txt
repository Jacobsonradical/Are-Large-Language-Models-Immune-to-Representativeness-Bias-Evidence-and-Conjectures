To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step process to calculate it:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
   - The initial probability (prior) that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The initial probability (prior) that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason matches traits often associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, but does not enjoy drawing or writing).
   - Let's denote the likelihood of Jason being described given he is a computer science professor as \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \).
   - Similarly, denote the likelihood of Jason being described given he is a humanities professor as \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Bayes' theorem formula is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
     \]

Since we don't have specific numbers for \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \), we must make a reasonable assumption based on given traits. Generally, the description fits better for a computer science professor considering his interests in coding and mathematical puzzles.

Assuming:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) would be relatively high, say around 0.8 (80%).
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \) would be relatively low, say around 0.1 (10%).

Plugging in these values:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
\]

Now calculate the posterior:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.

Accordingly, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.727"}
