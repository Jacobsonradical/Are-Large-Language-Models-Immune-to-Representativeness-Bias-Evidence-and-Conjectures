To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(E\): The evidence given in the description (Jason's traits and interests).

We are interested in \(P(C|E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E|C)\) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence.

First, let's determine \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

To compute \(P(E|C)\) and \(P(E|H)\), we must evaluate how well Jason's description matches the typical traits of each group. Given Jasonâ€™s interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing), let's make reasonable assumptions:

- Computer science professors are more likely to enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
- Humanities professors might enjoy writing more and might be less associated with coding.

We can assume:
- \(P(E|C)\) is relatively high because Jason's description fits typical traits of a computer science professor.
- \(P(E|H)\) is relatively low because his description does not fit as well with typical traits of a humanities professor.

Since these probabilities are subjective, let's assign reasonable values based on the typicality:
- \(P(E|C) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E|H) = 0.1\)

\(P(E)\) can be determined by the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \] 

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \] 

\[ P(E) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \] 

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \] 

\[ P(C|E) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.727"}
