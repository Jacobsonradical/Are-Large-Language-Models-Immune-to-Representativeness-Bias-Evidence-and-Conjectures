To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \): The probability of having the described traits given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \): The probability of having the described traits given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the strong association of Jason’s interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles) with computer science, we assume that \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \) is much higher than \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \). Let's assign:

   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood considering his interest)
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood)

3. **Normalizing Constant:**
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \times P(H) \)
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem, \( P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \)
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
