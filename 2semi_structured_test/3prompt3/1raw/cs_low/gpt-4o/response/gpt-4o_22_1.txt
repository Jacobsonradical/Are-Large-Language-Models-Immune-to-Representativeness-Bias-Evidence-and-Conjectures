To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the given description.

Firstly, identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(computer science) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(description|computer science) \)
- \( P(description|humanities) \)

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and based on stereotypes and common traits, it's reasonable to assume that computer science professors are more likely to match this description than humanities professors.

Let's assign some estimates:
- \( P(description|computer science) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood due to alignment with typical computer science interests)
- \( P(description|humanities) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood since coding and mathematical puzzles are less common in humanities)

Calculate the total probability of the description:
\[ P(description) = P(description|computer science) \cdot P(computer science) + P(description|humanities) \cdot P(humanities) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.35 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(computer science|description) = \frac{P(description|computer science) \cdot P(computer science)}{P(description)} \]
\[ P(computer science|description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(computer science|description) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(computer science|description) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(computer science|description) \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.57"}
