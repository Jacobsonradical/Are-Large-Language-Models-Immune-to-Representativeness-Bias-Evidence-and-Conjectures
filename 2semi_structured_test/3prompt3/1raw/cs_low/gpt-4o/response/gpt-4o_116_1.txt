To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's go through the process step by step.

Firstly, we recognize the following probabilities:
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now we need to consider the likelihoods of Jasonâ€™s description for each group:
- Let's denote this description as \( D \).
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The probability that a computer science professor has this description.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability that a humanities professor has this description.

For the purpose of Bayes' theorem, we take into account the likelihood ratios:
- Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles and jogging, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors.
- The fact that Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with humanities professors.

We can reasonably assume that \( P(D \mid CS) \) is higher than \( P(D \mid H) \). However, without specific values, we can conceptually represent this as:

- Let's assume \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given typical traits of CS professors).
- Let's assume \( P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood given typical traits of humanities professors).

Bayes' theorem then states:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{(0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)} \]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( 0.8 \times 0.25 = 0.2 \)

Denominator: \( (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \)

So,

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{20}{35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
