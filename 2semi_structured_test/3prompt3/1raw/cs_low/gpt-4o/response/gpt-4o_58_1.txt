To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, we start with the prior probabilities:
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we consider the likelihoods, which we need to estimate based on the description provided:
- Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, qualities often associated with computer science, and not so much with humanities, it suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor.
- Jason's lack of interest in drawing or writing, activities more common in the humanities, further supports this.

We'll denote:
- P(D|CS): probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D|H): probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. 

It's reasonable to assume:
- P(D|CS) is fairly high, let’s assume 0.8 for illustration.
- P(D|H) is fairly low, let’s assume 0.2 for illustration.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67
\]

Therefore,
\[
{"probability": "0.67"}
\]
