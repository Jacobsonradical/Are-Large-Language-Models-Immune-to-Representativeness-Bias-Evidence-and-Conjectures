To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description being observed if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description being observed.

Given:
- The study has descriptions of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- This means the prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|CS) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|H) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Without precise data on these likelihoods, we can make a judgment based on the given description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor.
- Hence, we might reason that \( P(B|CS) \) is relatively high and \( P(B|H) \) is relatively low.

Although not having exact values, a reasonable assumption might be:
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|H) \approx 0.2 \)

Total probability \( P(B) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now apply these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately \( 0.571 \).
