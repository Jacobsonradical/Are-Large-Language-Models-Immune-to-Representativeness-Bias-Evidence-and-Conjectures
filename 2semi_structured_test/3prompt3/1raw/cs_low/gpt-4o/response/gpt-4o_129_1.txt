To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to consider both the base rates and the likelihood of the observed characteristics given each profession.

1. **Base Rate Information**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Similarly, the prior probability \( P(HUM) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
Since we are given Jason's description, we need to estimate how likely this description is for both computer science professors and humanities professors. The description suggests that Jason's activities and interests are more aligned with common perceptions of a computer science professor (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

   - Let's denote \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of observing the description given Jason is in computer science. This might be high based on the alignment of his interests with the field.
   - Conversely, \( P(D|HUM) \) is the probability of observing the description given Jason is in the humanities. This might generally be lower, as the described activities are less common in this group.

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.90 \), indicating a high likelihood that someone with Jason's description is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|HUM) = 0.20 \), indicating a lower likelihood that someone with Jason's description is a humanities professor.

3. **Posterior Calculation**:
Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of observing the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(D) = (0.90 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.60 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.60"}
