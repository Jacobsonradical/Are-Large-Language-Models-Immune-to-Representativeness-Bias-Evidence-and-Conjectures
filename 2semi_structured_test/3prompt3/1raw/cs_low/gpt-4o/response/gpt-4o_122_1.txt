To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that event A (Jason is a computer science professor) occurs given that event B (the personality description) is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B (the personality description) given that event A (Jason is a computer science professor) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A (Jason being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B (the personality description).

First, let's determine the relevant probabilities:
- We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(\neg A) \):
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting the given description if Jason is a computer science professor. Given the information about Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is highly likely (say 0.9) that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of getting the given description if Jason is a humanities professor. Given that humanities professors are less frequently associated with coding and mathematical puzzles, we can assume this probability is fairly low (say 0.2).

Now we calculate the total probability of the description \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Lastly, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
