To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The main ingredients are the base rates and the likelihoods based on the given description.

First, we establish prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor, P(CS), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor, P(Hum), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to determine the likelihood of the description given each category. The description highlights attributes that are more likely associated with a computer science professor, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

However, without specific numerical likelihoods, we make an informed assumption based on the description:
- Let's say P(description | CS) is high, say 0.8, reflecting that the description fits well with a computer science professor.
- Let's assume P(description | Hum) is lower, say 0.2, reflecting that the description is less typical for a humanities professor.

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Where:
\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description} | Hum) \times P(Hum)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

So:
\[
P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.57"}
\]
