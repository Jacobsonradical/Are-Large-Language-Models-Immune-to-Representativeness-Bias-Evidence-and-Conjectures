To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   Based on the description, we need to compare how likely the description fits a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor. Given the specific interests and characteristics detailed (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, and no interest in drawing or writing), it seems more typical of a computer science professor.

   Let's assume:
   - The likelihood of this description fitting a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (since these traits strongly align with computer science)
   - The likelihood of this description fitting a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (since these traits are quite uncharacteristic of humanities professors)

3. **Applying Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample is 0.75.
