Given the description, we need to update our prior belief that Jason is a computer science professor based on the provided information.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Number of computer science professors (C): 25
   - Number of humanities professors (H): 75
   - Total number of professors: 25 + 75 = 100

   The prior probability \( P(C) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

   The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits seem more indicative of someone in computer science rather than humanities.

   We denote:
   - \( P(D|C) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

   Given that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles which are stereotypically more computer science-oriented, we assign a higher likelihood to:
   \( P(D|C) > P(D|H) \)

   For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
   \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \)
   \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability** \( P(C|D) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)
   \]

   Calculating \( P(D) \):
   \[
   P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
   \]

   Now, calculating \( P(C|D) \):
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
   \]

In conclusion, the updated (posterior) probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
