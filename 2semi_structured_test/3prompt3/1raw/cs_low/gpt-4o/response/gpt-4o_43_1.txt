To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given:

- A total of 100 professors, with 25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities.
- The description of Jason seems to align more with a computer science professor, considering his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The prior probability \( P(\text{Hum}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We will assume that the likelihood of the specific traits described (enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.) is considerably higher for computer science professors than for humanities professors. Let's denote \( P(\text{traits}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{traits}|\text{Hum}) \) as the probabilities of Jason having the described traits given he is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

Without specific numerical values, but based on the strong alignment of his traits with those typically found in computer science, let's posit:

- \( P(\text{traits}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood).
- \( P(\text{traits}|\text{Hum}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{traits}) = \frac{P(\text{traits}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{traits})} \]

where

\[ P(\text{traits}) = P(\text{traits}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{traits}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(\text{traits}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{traits}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{traits}) = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{traits}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{traits}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{traits}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
