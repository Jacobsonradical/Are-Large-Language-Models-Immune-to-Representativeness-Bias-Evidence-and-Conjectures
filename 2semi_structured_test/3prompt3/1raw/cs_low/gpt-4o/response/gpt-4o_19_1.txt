To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we will use Bayes' theorem. We need to incorporate the prior probability and the likelihood of observing Jason's characteristics.

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The prior probability (P(Hum)) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is:
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess the likelihood of observing Jason's characteristics given that he is a computer science professor (P(Description|CS)) and given that he is a humanities professor (P(Description|Hum)).
   - Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, along with being conservative and careful, is more typical for a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Although not impossible, such a profile is generally more aligned with the characteristics often associated with computer science.

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem gives us the posterior probability:
     \[
     P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
     \]
   - Where:
     \[
     P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
     \]

Given that the description fits a computer science professor more closely, we can make reasonable assumptions about the likelihood:

- Assume \(P(Description|CS)\) is high (e.g., 0.8) because the description fits a computer science professor well.
- Assume \(P(Description|Hum)\) is low (e.g., 0.2) because the description fits a humanities professor less well.

Plugging these into the formula:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.20 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

Then, the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.57.
