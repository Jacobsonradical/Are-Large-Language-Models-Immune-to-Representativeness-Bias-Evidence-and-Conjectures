To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem in this context can be outlined as:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | Description) \) is the posterior probability we want.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any chosen description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description) \) is the overall probability of the description.

To start, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Humanities) \). The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which fits a stereotypical profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

Let's assume:

- \( P(Description | CS) \) is quite high, say 0.8.
- \( P(Description | Humanities) \) is lower, let's assume 0.1.

The overall probability of the description \( P(Description) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.275 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:

{"probability": "0.727"}
