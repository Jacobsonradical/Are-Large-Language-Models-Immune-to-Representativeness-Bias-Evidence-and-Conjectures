First, let's analyze the prior probability and then the likelihood based on the description.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   There are 25 successful computer science professors and 75 successful humanities professors. Hence, the prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
   
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   
   Similarly, the prior probability (P(Hum)):
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   The description provided seems more typical of a computer science professor given the interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing. 

   Let's denote:
   - \( D \) is the description provided.
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of this description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|Hum) \) is the probability of this description given that he is a humanities professor.

   Given the information, it's reasonable to say that the description fits more closely to the archetype of a computer science professor. For instance, we can maybe assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) and \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description across both fields of study:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
   \]

   Then,
   
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
