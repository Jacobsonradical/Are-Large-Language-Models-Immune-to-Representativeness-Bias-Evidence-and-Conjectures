To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

First, let's define the probabilities we need:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \): the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{description}) \): the total probability of the description.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors \( = 25 \)
- Number of humanities professors \( = 75 \)
- Total number of professors \( = 100 \)

So,
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \)
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \)

Given Jason's affinities for coding, mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and knowing the provided fields (CS and humanities), it seems more likely that his description fits a CS professor better than a humanities professor.

Assume:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \)

Now calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
