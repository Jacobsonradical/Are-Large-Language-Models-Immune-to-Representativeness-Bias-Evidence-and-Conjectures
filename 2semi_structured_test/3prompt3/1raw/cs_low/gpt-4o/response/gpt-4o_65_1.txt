To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or description provided.

We need to determine:
1. \( P(A) \) - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \) - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \) - The total probability of the description.

### Step 1: Prior probability, \( P(A) \)

There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total. So,

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Prior probability, \( P(A') \)

The complement event is that Jason is a humanities professor: 

\[ P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

### Step 3: Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \)

Jasonâ€™s characteristics (interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing) seem to align more with computer science rather than humanities. Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) and \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \) as rough estimates.

### Step 4: Total probability, \( P(B) \)

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

### Step 5: Posterior probability, \( P(A|B) \)

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.
