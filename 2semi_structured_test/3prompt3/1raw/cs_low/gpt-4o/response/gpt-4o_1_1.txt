To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability and the likelihoods need to be taken into account.

Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \), is:
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood of the description**:
   - Given Jason's description, we need to estimate how likely it is that such a description would fit a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   - Let’s denote \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.
   - Given the information about Jason’s interests in coding, mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|Hum) \). For the sake of this calculation, we might assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \). These values are illustrative and could be adjusted based on more precise information.

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - The denominator, \( P(D) \), is the total probability of the description across both groups:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
     \]
     \[
     P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
     \]
   - Therefore, the posterior probability is:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
     \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
