To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our desired posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, define the two events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A^c \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Similarly, \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood Jason is described this way if he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A^c) \): The likelihood Jason is described this way if he is a humanities professor.

While we do not have exact values for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), based on the description mentioning interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles (traits more common among computer scientists), we can qualitatively assess that \( P(B|A) \) is likely higher than \( P(B|A^c) \).

Assume:
   - \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \): High probability for a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \): Much lower, but non-zero probability for a humanities professor.

3. **Total probability of the description, \( P(B) \):**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
