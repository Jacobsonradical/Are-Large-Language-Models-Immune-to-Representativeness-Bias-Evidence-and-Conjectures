To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors (\( n_{cs} = 25 \))
- 75 humanities professors (\( n_{hum} = 75 \))
- Total professors = 100 (\( n_{total} = 100 \))

The prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_{cs}) = \frac{n_{cs}}{n_{total}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{hum}) = \frac{n_{hum}}{n_{total}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we need to compute \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description, we use:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{cs}) \cdot P(A_{cs}) + P(B|A_{hum}) \cdot P(A_{hum}) \]

Given that the description fits the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor more closely (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(B|A_{cs}) \) is high.
- \( P(B|A_{hum}) \) is low.

Suppose:
- \( P(B|A_{cs}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|A_{hum}) = 0.2 \)

Then:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{cs}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{cs}) \cdot P(A_{cs})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.57"}
