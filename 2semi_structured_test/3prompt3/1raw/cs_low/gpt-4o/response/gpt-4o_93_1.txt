To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I will apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events and provides a means to revise predictions given new evidence.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total of 100 professors

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is: 

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science,
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities,
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests and traits, it is much more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Letâ€™s assume that \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.1 \) due to his strong inclination towards activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) P(CS) + P(D|Hum) P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now plug the values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
