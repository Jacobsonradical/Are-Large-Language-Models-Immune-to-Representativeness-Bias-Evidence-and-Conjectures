To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Given the initial conditions:
- We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The base rate probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The base rate probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We also need to consider how likely the description of Jason fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing seem to fit more characteristically with a computer science professor.

Let's denote:
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

To compute \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Now, let's assume probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) based on the common characteristics identified in the description. Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \): The description fits a computer science professor very well.
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \): The description fits a humanities professor less well.

Substitute these values in:

\[
P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
\]

Now to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.727.

In the required format:

```
{"probability": "0.727"}
