To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) is the observed personality description of Jason

Let's consider the various components step by step:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability, \( P(A') \)**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
   \[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   This is the probability of the description being a computer science professor. Given Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science, this likelihood is higher. For the sake of this problem, let's assume it is 0.8.

4. **Complementary Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \)**:
   This is the probability of the description being a humanities professor. Given Jason's lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are more typical for humanities, this likelihood is lower. For this problem, let's estimate it as 0.2.

5. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \)**:
   This is the normalization factor and is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Substituting these values back into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
