To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start by recognizing the prior probabilities and updating them with the likelihood of observing Jason’s characteristics given the two groups.

Let's define the following:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of observing Jason's description.

1. Priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

So, \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \).

2. Likelihood:
Given Jason’s description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it seems more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We would generally assume that:

- \( P(D | CS) \) is high, since these traits are more common in computer science professors.
- \( P(D | H) \) is low, since these traits are less common among humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's arbitrarily assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \).

3. Posterior:
By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
