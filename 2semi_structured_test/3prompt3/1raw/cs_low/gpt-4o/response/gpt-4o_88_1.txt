To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that hypothesis A (Jason is a computer science professor) is true given that we have observed B (Jason's description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing B given that A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis A before observing B.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing B under all hypotheses.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (C) and 75 humanities professors (H), so \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The description of Jason fits a profile more likely to be associated with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than with a humanities professor.

Assume that the likelihoods \( P(B|C) \) and \( P(B|H) \) can be estimated as follows:
- We might estimate a high probability for \( P(B|C) \) since the description aligns well with typical traits of a computer science professor.
- We might estimate a lower probability for \( P(B|H) \) since the description does not align as well with humanities professors.

For practical purposes, let's assume:
- \( P(B|C) \approx 0.8 \) (80% chance that a computer science professor fits the profile described).
- \( P(B|H) \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance that a humanities professor fits the profile described).

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|B) = \frac{P(B|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(C|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
