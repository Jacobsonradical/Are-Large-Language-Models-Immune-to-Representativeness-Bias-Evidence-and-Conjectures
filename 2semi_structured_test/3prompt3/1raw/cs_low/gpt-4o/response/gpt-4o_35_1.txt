Let's break down the information step by step to arrive at the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's outline the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the given description.

### Priors
- Number of computer science professors (\( P(CS) \)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\( P(H) \)): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

We are selecting one professor at random, so the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihoods
The description provided suggests certain traits that are more commonly associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Let's denote:
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given the description's emphasis on coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it is reasonable to assume that these traits are much more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. There is no exact quantitative likelihood given, but we can estimate based on common sense:

Assume:
\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \] (very high because the traits seem to fit a computer science profile)
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \] (low because the traits do not generally fit the profile of a humanities professor)

### Posterior Probability
To calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{"0.75"}\]
