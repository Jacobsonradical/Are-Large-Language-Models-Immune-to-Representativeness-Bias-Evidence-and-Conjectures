Given the description of Jason, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \).

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We know from the problem:
- There are 25 computer science professors (C) and 75 humanities professors (H).
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we do not have precise data on the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the information given to estimate these probabilities.

Given Jason’s interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and not enjoying drawing or writing):
- These activities and preferences seem more aligned with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor.
- Therefore, we could assume \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high, and \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low.

However, without specific data, we can only make educated guesses. Let's make a rough estimation:

Assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) (common among computer science professors)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (less common among humanities professors)

We can use these in Bayes’ theorem as follows:

First, calculate the total probability of the description \(D\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now calculate \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571 or 57.1%.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.571"}
