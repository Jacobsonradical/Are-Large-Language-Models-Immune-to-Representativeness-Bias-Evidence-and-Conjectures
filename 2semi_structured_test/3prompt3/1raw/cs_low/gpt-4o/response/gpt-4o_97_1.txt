To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. 

Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We want to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We know that:
- The total sample consists of 100 professors.
- 25 of them are computer science professors.
- 75 of them are humanities professors.

So, \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \) are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To find \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), consider the description provided. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are traits more strongly associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors.

Let's assume the probability of finding such a description \( D \) in computer science professors \( P(D \mid C) \) is high, say 0.8, and in humanities professors \( P(D \mid H) \) is low, say 0.1.

Now we need to find \( P(D) \) by the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.275 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.727.

Thus, our answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.727"}
