To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update probabilities based on new evidence.

First, let's define our prior probabilities. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \) and given that he is a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \).

- Likelihood \( P(D|CS) \): Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These traits are more indicative of a computer science professor.
- Likelihood \( P(D|H) \): While it is possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is less common based on the given description.

For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given his traits align well with a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given his traits do not align well with a typical humanities professor)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.2 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
