To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

We are given the following:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (CS).
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (Hum).
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from CS.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from Hum.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

First, we calculate the priors:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). The description of Jason includes elements that are more aligned with typical computer science interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). For estimation purposes:
- Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high probability since the interests match well with typical CS-related activities).
- Let's assume \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.2 \) (lower probability since these interests are less common in humanities professors).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{20}{35} \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.
