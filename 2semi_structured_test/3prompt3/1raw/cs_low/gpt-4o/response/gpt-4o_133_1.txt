To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor (CS).
- \(B\) is the evidence provided by Jason's description.

Firstly, letâ€™s list out the given probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B) \): The total probability of observing the given description \(B\). We will calculate this by considering both the computer science and humanities professors.

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(B|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description fits a computer science professor more than a humanities professor due to interests and activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, we can set reasonable estimates for \(( B|CS )\) and \((B|H)\):
- Suppose \( P(B|CS) = 0.8 \)
- Suppose \( P(B|H) = 0.2 \)

With these values, we can calculate \(P(B)\):

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
