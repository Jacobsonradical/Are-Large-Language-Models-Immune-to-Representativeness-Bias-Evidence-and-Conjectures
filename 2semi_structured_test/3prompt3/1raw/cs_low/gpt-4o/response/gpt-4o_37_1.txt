To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
      \[
      P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
      \]
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample.
      \[
      P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
      \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(Desc | CS)\)).
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Desc | Hum)\)).

Given Jasonâ€™s interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing), it's reasonable to assume that these traits are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(Desc | CS) = 0.8 \quad \text{(high probability for computer science)}
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc | Hum) = 0.2 \quad \text{(low probability for humanities)}
   \]

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]
Where \(P(Desc)\) is the total probability of the description, which can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

Now we calculate \(P(CS | Desc)\):
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.571.

The answer in the required format:
```json
{"probability": "0.571"}
