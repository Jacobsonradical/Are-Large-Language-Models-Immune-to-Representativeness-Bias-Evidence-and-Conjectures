To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, 
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description given matches Jason.

First, let's lay out the probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The probability that Jason is from the computer science group before considering the description.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^\text{C}) \)**: The probability that Jason is from the humanities group.
   \[ P(A^\text{C}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability that Jason's description matches someone from the computer science professors. While we don't know this exactly, we can assume that the interests in coding and mathematical puzzles are more common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors. For estimation, let's assume:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A^\text{C}) \)**: The probability that Jason's description matches someone from the humanities professors. Given Jason's interests, this is likely lower. Let's estimate:
   \[ P(B|A^\text{C}) \approx 0.2 \]

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**: The total probability that the description matches any professor in the sample, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^\text{C}) \cdot P(A^\text{C}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
