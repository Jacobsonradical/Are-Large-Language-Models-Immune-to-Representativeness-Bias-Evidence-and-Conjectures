To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{HU}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \): The likelihood of the description, given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{HU}) \): The likelihood of the description, given Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{HU}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since the description mentions attributes (like coding and solving mathematical puzzles) that seem more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we can make a reasonable assumption about the likelihoods:

- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is higher because the description fits a computer science profile more closely.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{HU}) \) is lower because itâ€™s less likely for a humanities professor to have a strong inclination toward coding and mathematical puzzles.

Let's use hypothetical values for these likelihoods based on the description:
- Assume \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.8 \)
- Assume \( P(\text{description} | \text{HU}) = 0.1 \)

Now we need to find \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{HU}) \cdot P(\text{HU}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.275 \]

Finally, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \approx 0.727 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
