To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \) as the evidence given by the description of Jason.

### Prior Probabilities
The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihoods
We need \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \), the probabilities of observing the evidence given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, disinterest in drawing or writing), it's more likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor. So we assign reasonable values to these likelihoods:

Let's assume:
\[ P(E | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E | H) = 0.1 \]

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, calculated as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

Putting it all together:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
