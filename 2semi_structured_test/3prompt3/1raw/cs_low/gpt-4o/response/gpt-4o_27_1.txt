Let's break this down using Bayes' theorem for a clearer understanding.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): 
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)): 
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Considering the Description**:
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These activities align more closely with characteristics common to computer science professionals.
 
3. **Likelihood**:
   - Let's denote the characteristics described for Jason as "D".
   - The probability of observing "D" given he is a CS professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) is likely higher. For the sake of simplicity and without specific data, let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx 0.95 \]
   - The probability of observing "D" given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)) is likely lower. Let's assume:
\[ P(D|Hum) \approx 0.05 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - To find the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description, we use:  
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   - We need to find \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description "D":
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.95 \cdot 0.25 + 0.05 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2375 + 0.0375 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.275 \]

5. **Calculating Posterior**:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2375}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.8636 \]

Therefore, based on the given description and calculations, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.864.

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.864"}
