To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given observed evidence.

First, let's define our events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (the description of Jason).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|C) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \): The total probability of the evidence.

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) is:
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely characteristics of a computer science professor. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(E|C) \) is relatively high compared to \( P(E|H) \), say \( P(E|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|H) \) is relatively low, say \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|E) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
