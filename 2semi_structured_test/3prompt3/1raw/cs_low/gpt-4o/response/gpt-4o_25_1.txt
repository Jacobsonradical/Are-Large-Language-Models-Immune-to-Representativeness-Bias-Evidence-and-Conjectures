To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a CS professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason's description occurring in the overall sample.

First, we establish the prior probabilities based on the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \). Based on the description, Jason seems to exhibit traits more closely associated with a computer science professor (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) than a humanities professor. Let's assume:
- \( P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high probability that a CS professor fits this description)
- \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \) (lower probability that a humanities professor fits this description)

We combine these to find \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, we calculate the posterior:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
