To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's note the prior probabilities, which are based on the size of the two groups:

1. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group (\( P(CS) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
2. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group (\( P(Hum) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description of Jason suggests characteristics that could be more associated with professors in computer science, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. To apply Bayes' theorem accurately, we need to make some assumptions about how likely each group is to have these traits. Let's denote:

- \( P(Desc \mid CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Desc \mid Hum) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Assuming that coding and mathematical puzzles are much more likely to be interests of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we can hypothesize that:

- \( P(Desc \mid CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.8.
- \( P(Desc \mid Hum) \) is relatively low, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{P(Desc \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

where \( P(Desc) \) is:

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.275 \]

Thus:

\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Desc) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Desc) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
