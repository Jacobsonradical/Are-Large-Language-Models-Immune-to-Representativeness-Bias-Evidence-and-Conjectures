To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which involves combining prior probabilities with the likelihood of observing the given description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- Similarly, the prior probability (P(Hum)) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods based on the description provided:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. He is talented, ambitious, conservative, and careful. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing.
- These traits suggest a higher likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor because coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more closely aligned with the typical activities and interests of someone in this field compared to someone in the humanities.

Let's denote the likelihood of observing the description given that the professor is from computer science as \( P(Description|CS) \), and the likelihood of observing the description given that the professor is from the humanities as \( P(Description|Hum) \).

For the sake of argument, let's assume:
- \( P(Description|CS) = 0.8 \) (indicating that the description matches a computer science professor quite well)
- \( P(Description|Hum) = 0.2 \) (indicating that the description does not match a humanities professor very well)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.571"}\} \]
