To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that event A (Jason is a computer science professor) occurs given event B (the description matches Jason).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood that event B occurs given that event A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A (the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of event B (the probability of the description).

First, calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, calculate the prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

I will assume \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor) and \( P(B|A') \) (the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) based on common stereotypes and observations in personality traits:

- Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these traits are more typical of someone in computer science.
- The description also indicates a lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are more aligned with humanities activities.

Thus, it's reasonable to propose:
\[ P(B|A) > P(B|A') \]

While these proportions are subjective and based on assumptions, for this calculation, let's assign a high likelihood for computer science:

\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|A') = 0.2 \]

Now, based on Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.5714 \).

Thus,

{"probability": "0.5714"}
