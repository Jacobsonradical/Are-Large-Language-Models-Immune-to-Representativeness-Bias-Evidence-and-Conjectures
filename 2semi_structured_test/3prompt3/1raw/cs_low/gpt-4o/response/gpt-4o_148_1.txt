To answer this question, we should use Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall (marginal) probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**

Jason could be one of 25 CS professors or one of 75 humanities professors:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \):**

The description includes details that might be more common among CS professors:
- Enjoys coding,
- Solving mathematical puzzles,
- Ambitious,
- Careful.

So, let's reasonably assume that \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) is high, since these traits align well with a typical profile of a CS professor. Let's assign \( P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \).

For humanities professors, the description fits less well. Hence, \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \) is lower. Letâ€™s assume \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \).

3. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.6, or 60%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.6"}
