To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we break down the problem:

1. **Prior Probability:** The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor without any additional information is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the probability \( P(CS) \) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Probability:** The probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood:** We need the probability of the given description \( D \) being observed given that the professor is from computer science \( P(D|CS) \) and humanities \( P(D|H) \). Since these probabilities are not directly provided, we can use Jasonâ€™s interests and traits to make a rational estimation:
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science professors.
   - Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be less common among humanities professors.

Given these factors, let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
(since coding and solving puzzles are highly indicative of computer science)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]
(since coding and solving puzzles are less typical for humanities)

4. **Posterior Probability:** Using Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
