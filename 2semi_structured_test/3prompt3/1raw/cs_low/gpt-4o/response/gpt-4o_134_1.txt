To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D | CS) \): The probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
   - \( P(D | H) \): The probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.

Given Jason's described interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, his conservative nature, and lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume \( P(D | CS) \) is quite high and \( P(D | H) \) is quite low. Let's use reasonable hypothetical values based on these descriptions:
   - \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
   - \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
