To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability based on new evidence. The theorem can be represented as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability we want (the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description regardless of Jason's field.

First, calculate the prior probabilities. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the priors are:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, consider the likelihoods. The description features traits like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, typically associated more with computer science professors. Although we don’t have specific data, let’s assume high values for these likelihoods:

\[ P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | Hum) = 0.1 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(CS|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|\text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
