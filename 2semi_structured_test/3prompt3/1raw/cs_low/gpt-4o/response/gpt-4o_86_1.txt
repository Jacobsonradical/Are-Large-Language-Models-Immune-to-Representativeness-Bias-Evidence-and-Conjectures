Based on the description of Jason, we are looking to determine the likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a professor in the humanities. 

First, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without any additional information, a given professor would have a probability of \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) of being from computer science and \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) of being from the humanities.

Next, we'll evaluate how well Jason's characteristics align with what we might expect from computer science versus humanities professors.

Considering Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles which are more strongly associated with computer science, these are significant indicators towards computer science. His disinterest in drawing or writing further supports this, as these are generally more aligned with the humanities.

To adjust the probabilities considering this new evidence (Jason's description), we would apply Bayes' Theorem, where we'll update our prior beliefs (base rates) with the likelihood of Jason's profile being a computer science professor.

If we assume the description of enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is significantly more likely in computer science professors (let’s say 90% likely) and significantly less in humanities professors (let’s say 10% likely):

\[P(\text{Profile} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9\]
\[P(\text{Profile} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.1\]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Profile}) = \frac{P(\text{Profile} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Profile})}\]

The denominator \(P(\text{Profile})\) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Profile}) = P(\text{Profile} \mid CS) \times P(CS) +  P(\text{Profile} \mid Humanities) \times P(Humanities) \]

So, we get:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Profile}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{(0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75)} \]

Calculating this:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Profile}) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
