To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (C) given the description, I will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of picking a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Without specific information about \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can make educated guesses based on the description:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely for a computer science professor.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be less common among humanities professors.

Hence, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high, for instance, let's say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low, for instance, let's say \( 0.2 \).

Using these values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
