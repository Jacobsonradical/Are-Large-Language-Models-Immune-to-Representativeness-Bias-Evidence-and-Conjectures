To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here's the setup:
- The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The base rate of humanities professors in the sample is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Jason's description seems to align more closely with traits and activities often associated with computer science professors (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities professors.

However, we need to translate this qualitative assessment into a probability. Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We need \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) which is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) which is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the description aligns quite well with the activities and traits often associated with computer science professors, we might assume:
- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.1 \)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

where \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \).

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now,

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
