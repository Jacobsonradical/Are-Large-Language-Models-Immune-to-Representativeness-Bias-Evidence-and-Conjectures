To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

**Bayes' theorem** in this context is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that he's a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science).
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities).

Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = p \) is relatively high, given the interests of Jason that align more closely with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging).

Similarly, let's assume \( P(D|H) = q \) is low because his description is less typical of the attributes associated with humanities professors.

Now,
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

Assuming rough estimates for high and low probabilities:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

So:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.9 \times 0.25)}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) is:
