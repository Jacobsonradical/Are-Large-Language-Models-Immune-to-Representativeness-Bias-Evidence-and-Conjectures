To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(CS) \) = probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) = probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) = probability that the description fits a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) = overall probability of the description.

We want to find \( P(CS \mid D) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

From the description, Jason has interests and characteristics that align more closely with those typically associated with the field of computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.8 \) (high probability because of specific interests that align with computer science)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (low probability because the interests and characteristics are less common for humanities professors)

Now, we need \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.727 \).
