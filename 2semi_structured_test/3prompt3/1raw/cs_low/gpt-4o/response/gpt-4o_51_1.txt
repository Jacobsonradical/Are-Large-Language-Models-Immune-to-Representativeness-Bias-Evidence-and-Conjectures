To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here's the basic formula:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

In this scenario:
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of picking a computer science professor out of total professors).
- \( P(\neg H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of picking a humanities professor out of the total professors).

To calculate \( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|\neg H) \), we need to consider the description's fit. The description of Jason seems to align more closely with traits often associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles). We'll assign plausible likelihood values:

- \( P(E|H) \) (Probability of description given computer science professor) = 0.90 (a high likelihood, as the traits fit well with a CS professor).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (Probability of description given humanities professor) = 0.10 (low likelihood, as the traits fit poorly with what is typically expected of a humanities professor).

We can calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.90 \cdot 0.25) + (0.10 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.30 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.25}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.30} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
