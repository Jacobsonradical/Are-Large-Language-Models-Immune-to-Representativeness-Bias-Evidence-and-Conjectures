To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the iterative solution:

1. Prior Probabilities:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Likelihoods:
   - Likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description (\( P(D|CS) \)): This is generally assumed to be high, but we need to estimate it subjectively or based on additional data.
   - Likelihood that a humanities professor fits Jason's description (\( P(D|H) \)): This is subjectively lower because the description leans towards traits and interests more typically associated with computer science.

Given the context and Jason's distinctive traits leaning towards tech and analytical skills, I will apply an estimation:

- Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.7 \)
- And \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \)

3. Posterior Calculation using Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{(0.7 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)}
   \]

Simplifying:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.15} = \frac{0.175}{0.325} \approx 0.538
   \]

So, 

\[
{"probability": "0.54"}
\]
