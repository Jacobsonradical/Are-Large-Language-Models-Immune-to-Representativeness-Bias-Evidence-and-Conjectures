To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the relevant quantities:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the event that Jason fits the given description.

We are asked to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
3. \( P(D \mid C) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D \mid H) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

1. Prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. Likelihoods:
Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are stereotypically more aligned with computer science professors. Hence, we might assume \( P(D \mid C) \) to be relatively high compared to \( P(D \mid H) \).

While we don't have exact probabilities for \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we'll assume, reasonably, that \( P(D \mid C) = 0.7 \) (high due to the match with computer science traits) and \( P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \) (low due to the mismatch with humanities traits).

3. Total probability \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.175 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.325 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.175}{0.325} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.5385 \]

Therefore, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.54"}
