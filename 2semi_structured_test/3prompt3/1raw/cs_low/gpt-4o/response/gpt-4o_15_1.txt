To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that the description applies to Jason.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

So, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Also, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (let's call this event \( A' \)) is \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \) is the likelihood that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

The description indicates that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with computer science professors. However, it does not rule out the possibility that a humanities professor might have similar interests, but it is less likely.

For simplicity, let's make an informed guess:
- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \): There is an 80% chance that a computer science professor would match this description.
- Assume \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \): There is a 20% chance that a humanities professor would match this description.

Now, calculate the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.5714.
