To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the relevant steps and information:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement of Prior Probability (P(H)):** This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(description|CS)):** This is the probability that a computer science professor fits the given description. Given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor.

4. **Complement of Likelihood (P(description|H)):** This is the probability that a humanities professor fits the given description. Given the description, it seems less likely, but not impossible.

Since we don't have exact numbers for the likelihoods, we'll estimate based on the description provided:

- Let's assume \( P(description|CS) = 0.8 \) because Jason's interests are strongly aligned with computer science.
- Let's assume \( P(description|H) = 0.1 \) because Jason's interests are generally not aligned with humanities.

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability (P(CS|description)):

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.075}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2}{0.275}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) \approx 0.727
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.727"}}
\]
