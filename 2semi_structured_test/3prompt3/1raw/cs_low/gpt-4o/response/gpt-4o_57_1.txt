To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The general observation suggests that the description fits the profile of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.) more closely than a humanities professor. Though we don't have exact numerical values for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we can make reasonable assumptions based on typical traits associated with these disciplines.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.8 (indicating the description aligns well with a computer science professor).
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low, say 0.2 (indicating the description does not align as well with humanities professors).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the probabilities:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.
