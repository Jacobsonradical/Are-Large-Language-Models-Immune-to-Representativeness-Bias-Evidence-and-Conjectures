To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the given information and apply Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we must take into account the base rates and the likelihood of the description given each category (computer science professor or humanities professor).

1. **Base Rates:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.

2. **Probability of Choosing Each Group:**
   - P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

3. **Likelihood of Description Given Each Group:**
   - P(description | CS): The description heavily refers to interests and traits typical of computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and less typical of humanities professors.
   - P(description | H): While humanities professors might have a broad array of interests, the specific mention of coding and solving mathematical puzzles makes it less likely that the description would fit a humanities professor.

Given the description, we would intuitively expect:
   - P(description | CS) to be higher than P(description | H).

For the sake of estimation, letâ€™s assign:
   - P(description | CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood given the relevance to computer science)
   - P(description | H) = 0.1 (low likelihood given the description's relevance to computer science traits more than humanities).

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the estimated probabilities:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = 0.75 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
