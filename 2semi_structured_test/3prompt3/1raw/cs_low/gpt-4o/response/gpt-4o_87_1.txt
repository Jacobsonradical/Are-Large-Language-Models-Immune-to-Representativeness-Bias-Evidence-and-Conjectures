To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- CS as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- H as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods. The description matches traits often associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) more closely than those typically associated with humanities professors.

Assuming:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \)  (high likelihood given the strong alignment with computer science traits)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)  (low likelihood as traits do not strongly align with humanities)

Finally, we need \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
