To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's break down each component of the formula:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - This is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description.
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complement of event \( A \), \( \neg A \)**:
   - This is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors total.
   - Therefore, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Given the description mentions coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and general disinterest in writing/drawing, we assume it is more likely that Jason fits the computer science professor profile (but the exact probability might be assumed if not otherwise given).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Given the description mentions disinterest in writing/drawing, it is less likely that Jason fits the humanities professor profile (this too needs realistic quantification).

Given that specific probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) were not provided, I'll assume a situation where:

- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood due to matching interests).
- Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood since humanities professors typically might enjoy writing or related activities more).

Assuming the above values, we can now find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
