To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The main idea is to adjust our initial belief (prior probability) about Jason being a computer science professor based on the new evidence provided by his description.

### Prior Probability
First, determine the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Given 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
And the prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihood
Next, evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(description|CS) \), and the likelihood given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(description|Hum) \). Here, we have descriptive cues that align more with typical activities and preferences of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, less enjoyment in drawing or writing). Letâ€™s approximate these probabilities based on the description:

- Suppose the likelihood of Jason having this description if he is a computer science professor is \( P(description|CS) = 0.8 \).
- Suppose the likelihood of Jason having this description if he is a humanities professor is \( P(description|Hum) = 0.2 \).

### Posterior Probability
Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(description|Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

\[ P(description) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]

\[ P(description) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
