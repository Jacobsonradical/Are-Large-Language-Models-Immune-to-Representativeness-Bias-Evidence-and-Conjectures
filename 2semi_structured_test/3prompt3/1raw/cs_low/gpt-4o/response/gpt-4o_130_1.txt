To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (our goal).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) (Probability of being a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) (Probability of being a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Suppose we denote the descriptive features that suggest Jason might be more likely to be a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) with a rough probability, implicitly suggesting \( P(B|A) \) is high and \( P(B|\neg A) \) is low.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (Probability that a computer science professor has Jason's characteristics)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (Probability that a humanities professor has Jason's characteristics)

To calculate \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{20}{35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.5714 \).

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.5714"}
