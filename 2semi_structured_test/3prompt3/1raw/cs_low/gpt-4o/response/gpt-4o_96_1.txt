To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define some notations:
- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Total probability of the description.

We have the following prior probabilities based on the sample:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming that the description fits the characteristics of a computer science professor more closely than a humanities professor, we can estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) qualitatively. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these activities are more indicative of a computer science professor.

For simplicity and to provide a clear reasoning, let's make approximate estimates:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is likely high because the description aligns well with common traits of computer science professors. Let's estimate it as 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \) is likely low because the description doesn't align as well with common traits of humanities professors. Let's estimate it as 0.1.

Now, we can calculate the marginal probability \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
