To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we must define the following:

- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability that a random professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability that a random professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Thus:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more aligned with the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Since no explicit quantitative values are given, we will make educated guesses about these conditional probabilities:

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.90 \]  (since the description strongly aligns with computer science traits)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.10 \]  (since the description weakly aligns with humanities traits)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.25}{0.90 \cdot 0.25 + 0.10 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.300} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
