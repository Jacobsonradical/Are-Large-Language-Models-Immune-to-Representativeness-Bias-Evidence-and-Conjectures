To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given:

- 25 computer science professors (CS)
- 75 humanities professors (H)

Total professors = 25 (CS) + 75 (H) = 100

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \), the likelihoods of the description given Jason is a CS professor or a humanities professor, respectively. 

Based on the description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (Both are strongly associated with CS)
- Is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing (More common in CS)

These traits suggest that the likelihood of this description fitting a computer science professor is fairly high compared to a humanities professor. Let's make a reasonable estimation of these likelihoods:
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now we calculate the total probability of the description \( B \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS|B) \):
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
