To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge to the probability of another related event.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want to find, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood, the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability that any professor fits the description.

From the problem statement:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) of selecting a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Let's consider the likelihoods:
- Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more aligned with typical activities of a computer science professor.
- Thus, the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) that Jason's description fits a computer science professor is relatively high.
- Conversely, the likelihood \( P(B|A') \) that Jason's description fits a humanities professor is lower, given humanities professors are less likely to be described by such traits.

Since these exact values are not given, we'll use a qualitative assessment:
Assuming there's an 80% chance that a randomly drawn description of a computer science professor would match Jason's description:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]

And assuming there's a 20% chance that a randomly drawn description of a humanities professor would match Jason's description:
\[ P(B|A') = 0.20 \]

To normalize, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.20 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.571"}} \]
