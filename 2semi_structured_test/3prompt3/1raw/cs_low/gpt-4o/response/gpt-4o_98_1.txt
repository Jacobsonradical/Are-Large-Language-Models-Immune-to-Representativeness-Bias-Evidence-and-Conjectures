To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided in Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(CS|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):

- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability that a random professor is a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability that a random professor is a humanities professor)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(E|CS) \) and \( P(E|H) \). This involves estimating how likely it is for a professor of each type to fit Jason's description. Based on the description, traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles seem more aligned with a computer science professor.

For the sake of estimation, assume:
- \( P(E|CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the description fits a computer science professor well)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the description fits a humanities professor less well)

Now, we calculate the evidence probability \( P(E) \):

\[
P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
