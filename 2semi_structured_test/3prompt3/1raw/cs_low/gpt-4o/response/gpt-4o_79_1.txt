Given the nature of Jason's description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]

Here:
- \(A\) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \(B\) is the event "The description provided matches Jason."

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
   - Therefore, \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **P(A')**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - This is \(P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

3. **P(B|A)**: The probability that the description matches Jason given that he is a computer science professor.
   - The description mentions Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, all of which align more with a computer science professor's typical profile. Let's denote this likelihood as \(P_1\).

4. **P(B|A')**: The probability that the description matches Jason given that he is a humanities professor.
   - Given his traits mentioned (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's unlikely but still possible. Let's denote this likelihood as \(P_2\).

To provide a reasonably precise number, we assume coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of being in computer science:

- Assume \(P(B|A) = 0.8\)
- Assume \(P(B|A') = 0.2\)

Finally, we need to calculate \(P(B)\):

\[ 
P(B) = (P(B|A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(B|A') \cdot P(A'))
\]

\[ 
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) 
\]

\[ 
P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 
\]

\[ 
P(B) = 0.35 
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} 
\]

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} 
\]

\[ 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.571 
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.571\).

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
