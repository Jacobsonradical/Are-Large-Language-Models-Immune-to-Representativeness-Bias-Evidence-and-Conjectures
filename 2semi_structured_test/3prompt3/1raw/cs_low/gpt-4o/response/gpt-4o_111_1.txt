To solve this, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description \( D \).

From the problem, we know that the prior probability \( P(CS) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability \( P(H) \) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now let's consider \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, Jason is someone who enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seem more consistent with a computer science professor's profile than with a humanities professor's profile. Let's assign probabilities based on this consistency.

Let's assume for simplicity:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \]

To find \( P(D) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now we can find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

So the posterior probability is:
\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.5714"}} \]
