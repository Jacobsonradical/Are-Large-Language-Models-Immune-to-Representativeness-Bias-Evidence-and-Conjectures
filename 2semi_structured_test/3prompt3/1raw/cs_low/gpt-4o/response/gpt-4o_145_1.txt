To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is from the computer science group.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is from the computer science group.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(\text{CS}) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \):**
   - Given the description, Jason's characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. 

   Although we lack exact values, let’s denote our assessment as:
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is likely higher (say \( p_1 \)).
   - \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) is likely lower (say \( p_2 \)).

3. **Overall Probability, \( P(\text{Description}) \):**
   - This can be computed using the law of total probability:
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \)
   - Here, \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 1 - P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \).

Now, if we assume that:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = p_1 = 0.8 \) (highly probable, conservatively chosen),
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = p_2 = 0.2 \) (less probable, conservatively chosen),

\( P(\text{Description}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \).

Putting it all together using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:
