To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Using the given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

For Jason's description:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor.
2. Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more characteristic of humanities professors.

Because Jason's traits align more closely with the stereotype of a computer science professor, we can reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of the description given Jason is a CS professor) is higher than \( P(B|A^c) \).

We can estimate these probabilities:
- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood because the description fits a CS professor well).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) might be low since the description fits less well with the traits of humanities professors. So let's assume \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \).

Now we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \times 0.25)}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \{ "probability": "0.6" \}.
