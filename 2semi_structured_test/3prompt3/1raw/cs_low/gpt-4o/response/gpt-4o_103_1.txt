Given the description of Jason, we need to evaluate the likelihood that he belongs to the sample of computer science professors versus the sample of humanities professors. Here's how we can reason through this using Bayes' theorem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): 
     \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Humanities}) \)): 
     \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess how likely the description fits computer science professors versus humanities professors.
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing. These traits seem to strongly align with a computer science (CS) background.

   Assuming:
   - The likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's description (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)) is high. Let's approximate this to be \(0.9\).
   - The likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason's description (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)) would be lower. Let's approximate this to be \(0.2\).

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   
   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]
   
   Then:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{"probability": "0.6"\}
