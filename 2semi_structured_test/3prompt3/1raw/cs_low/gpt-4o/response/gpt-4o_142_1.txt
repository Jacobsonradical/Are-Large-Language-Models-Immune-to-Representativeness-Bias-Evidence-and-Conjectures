To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our goal).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor (A).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event of the description provided.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. The description includes elements typically associated with computer science, such as enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which makes this probability relatively high.
- \( P(B|A') \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. While it’s possible for a humanities professor to have these traits, it’s relatively less likely compared to a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume subjective estimates:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.7 \) (high, since he enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.1 \) (low, since these traits are less common among humanities professors)

Finally, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \), which is the weighted sum of the probabilities under both hypotheses:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.7 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.175 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now apply Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.175}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.7 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.7"}
