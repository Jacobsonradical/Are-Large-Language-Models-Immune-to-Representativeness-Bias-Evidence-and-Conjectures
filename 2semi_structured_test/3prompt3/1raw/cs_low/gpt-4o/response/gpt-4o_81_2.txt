To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description among computer science professors.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

First, we note the given numbers:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

These give us the priors:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we consider the likelihoods \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|Humanities) \). We are given a description of Jason which indicates:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing.

Given Jason's interests and activities, it is more likely he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We could roughly estimate the conditional probabilities, though they aren't precisely given in the problem:

Let’s assume:
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.8 \)  (Since the description fits typical characteristics of a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|Humanities) \approx 0.1 \)  (Since the description fits atypical characteristics of a humanities professor)

Next, we'll calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|Humanities) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is approximately 0.727.
