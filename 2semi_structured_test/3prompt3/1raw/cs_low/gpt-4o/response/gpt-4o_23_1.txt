First, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jasonâ€™s description.

In this context:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = Jason's description.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
The probability that Jason is a computer science professor without any additional information.
Given there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
The probability of Jason having his specific description given that he is a computer science professor.
This is somewhat subjective, but based on the given description - enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, creation of concepts fitting technology, and not enjoying drawing or writing - these traits are more typically associated with a computer science professor. So, we may assume it is relatively high. Let us assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.7 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
The probability of Jason having his description given that he is a humanities professor.
Since humanities professors typically do not engage much in activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles and are likely the opposite, let's assume this probability is low. Let us assume:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

5. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.175 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.175}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.7 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.7"} \]
