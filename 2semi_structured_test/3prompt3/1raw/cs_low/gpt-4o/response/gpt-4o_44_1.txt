To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (let's denote this event as \( CS \)), given the description provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:

- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior probability \( P(CS) \):**

   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so:

   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:**

   Similarly, there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so:

   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):**

   Based on the description, Jason's traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, conservative, etc.) seem to align more with the stereotypical traits of a computer science professor than with those of a humanities professor. Let's assume:

   - \( P(D | CS) \), the probability that a computer science professor has these traits, is relatively high. For the sake of estimation, say:

     \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \)

   - \( P(D | H) \), the probability that a humanities professor has these traits, is relatively low. Let's estimate:

     \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

4. **Total probability \( P(D) \):**

   This can be computed as:

   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[ P(D) = (0.9) \cdot (0.25) + (0.1) \cdot (0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

5. **Posterior probability using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:**

   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.9) \cdot (0.25)}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
