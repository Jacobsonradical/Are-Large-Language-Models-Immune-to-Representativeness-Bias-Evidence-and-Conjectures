To assess the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on his description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define our known values:

- The number of computer science professors (CS) in the study: 25
- The number of humanities professors (HUM) in the study: 75
- The total number of professors in the study: 100

We want to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's use Bayes' Theorem, which states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probability \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, assume the description fits certain traits common among computer science professors versus humanities professors. Jason's description mentions enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more closely aligned with computer science traits. Hence, let's estimate:

- The probability \( P(D | CS) \) is high.
- The probability \( P(D | HUM) \) is low.

To simplify, let's use rough estimates based on these assumptions:
\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | HUM) \approx 0.1 \]

To find \( P(D) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \times P(HUM) \]
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus,
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
