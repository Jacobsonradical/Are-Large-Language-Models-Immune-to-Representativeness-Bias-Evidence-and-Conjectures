Based on the description of Jason and considering the characteristics typically associated with computer science professors compared to humanities professors, we need to update our beliefs using Bayes' theorem.

First, we note our prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let’s consider the likelihoods of the evidence (Jason's description) under each category:
- The description includes a preference for coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which may be more indicative of a computer science professor. Other aspects like being conservative, careful, ambitious, and enjoying jogging are less discriminatory.

Assuming we quantify the increased likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor due to the evidence (let’s denote this as \( P(D|CS) \)) and similarly the likelihood if he were a humanities professor (let’s denote this as \( P(D|H) \)), we might reasonably assume the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor is higher. Let's say:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus,
{"probability": "0.571"}
