Let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting the given description of Jason.

First, we note the following prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to assess the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) of Jason having his described traits if he is a computer science professor, compared to if he is a humanities professor. 

Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, attributes which are very common among computer science professors and less likely among humanities professors, it seems reasonable to assume:

- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) is higher than \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \).

Using a qualitative estimate, we might guess something like:
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8 \) (high given his interests)
- \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) = 0.2 \) (low given the same reasons)

Now we can find \( P(B) \) as follows:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, our posterior that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
