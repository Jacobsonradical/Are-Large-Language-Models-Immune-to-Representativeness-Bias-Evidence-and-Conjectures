To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, 
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We need to determine:
1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description across all professors.

First, we calculate the prior probability, \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor. The description includes enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, which are more closely associated with a computer science professor. Let’s estimate \( P(B|A) \) as being relatively high—let’s assign it a value of 0.8.

Now, we need \( P(A^c) \) where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We also need \( P(B|A^c) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the characteristics described, it is less likely that a humanities professor fits this profile. Let’s estimate \( P(B|A^c) \) as being relatively low—let’s assign it a value of 0.1.

To find the total probability, \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.727.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.727"}
