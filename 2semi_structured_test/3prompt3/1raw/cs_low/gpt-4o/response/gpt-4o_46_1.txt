To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

First, we'll establish our prior probabilities. Given the study sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100

Thus, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods based on the description provided. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align more closely with typical activities of computer science professors rather than humanities professors. Also, his lack of interest in drawing or writing fits the stereotype of a computer scientist.

Let's assume:
- The likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor (P(D | CS)) is higher, say 0.8 (since the activities and traits are more aligned with a computer scientist).
- The likelihood of the description if Jason is a humanities professor (P(D | H)) is lower, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (P(CS | D)):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, computing \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
