To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS \mid D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probability \( P(CS) \). The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's assess the likelihoods \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). The description points to characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more typically associated with a computer science professor. We need to make an educated guess here since exact numerical likelihoods aren't given.

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high probability that a computer science professor fits the description).
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.2 \) (lower probability that a humanities professor fits the description).

Now, let's calculate \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.
