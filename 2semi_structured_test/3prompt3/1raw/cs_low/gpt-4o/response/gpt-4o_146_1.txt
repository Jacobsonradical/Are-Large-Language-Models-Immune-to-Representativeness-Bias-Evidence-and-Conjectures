To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of Jason's description

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To compute the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \), we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, note that \( P(D) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given Jason's interests in "coding," "solving mathematical puzzles," and being "highly creative" but not interested in "drawing or writing," it's reasonable to assume these traits are more indicative of computer science professors than humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | H) = 0.1 \]

Now, compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).
