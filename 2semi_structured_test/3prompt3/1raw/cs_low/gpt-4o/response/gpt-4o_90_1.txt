First, let's establish the prior probability using the information about the number of professors in each field:
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we should consider how the description of Jason fits typical profiles of computer science and humanities professors. The description includes the following key points:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (more characteristic of a computer science professor)
- Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing (less characteristic of a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem, we update the probabilities based on this new information. However, because we do not have specific likelihood values (the typicality of such traits among computer science vs. humanities professors based on the study), we'll need to use the qualitative understanding to adjust the probabilities.

Given the description, Jason appears more typical of a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles and lesser interest in drawing or writing.

With this qualitative assertion, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor should increase from the prior of 0.25.

We will estimate the posterior probability as follows:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.8 \]

Thus, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.8"}
