To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the prior probability and the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis to the posterior probability.

Here are the steps involved:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**:
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. The prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(HU))**:
   The prior probability (P(HU)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(description | CS))**:
   We need to estimate the likelihood that a description like Jason's fits a computer science professor (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing).

   Given Jason's interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it is likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor. Let's say this likelihood is high, for example, 0.9.

4. **Likelihood (P(description | HU))**:
   Similarly, we estimate the likelihood that a description like Jason's fits a humanities professor. This likelihood may be significantly lower since the interests and characteristics are less commonly associated with humanities professors. Let's say this likelihood is low, for example, 0.1.

5. **Posterior Probability (P(CS | description))**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   
   Where \(P(description)\) is calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | HU) \times P(HU)
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(description) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]
   
   Now, computing the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
