To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes’ theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

**Step 1: Identify the prior probabilities**

Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)):

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\text{Hu}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**Step 2: Identify the likelihoods**

Next, we evaluate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B| \text{Hu}) \).

Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creative but not enjoying drawing or writing), these traits are more likely to be associated with a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let’s assign some reasonable estimates:
- Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(B| \text{CS}) \)): 0.9
- Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(B| \text{Hu}) \)): 0.2

**Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \)**

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Hu}) \cdot P(\text{Hu}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

**Step 4: Apply Bayes' theorem**

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.6"} \]
