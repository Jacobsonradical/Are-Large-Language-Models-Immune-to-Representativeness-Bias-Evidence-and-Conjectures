To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We also need to determine the likelihoods:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor

Given the following information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical traits of a computer science professor.
- Jason is conservative and enjoys jogging, which doesn't specifically favor either field.
- Jason is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which again points away from humanities.

Given these traits, it is reasonable to assume that:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is relatively high
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is relatively low

However, without specific numerical values for these likelihoods, we make a qualitative judgment. Given the traits presented, it's reasonable to consider \( P(D \mid CS) \) being significantly higher than \( P(D \mid H) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem for the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Assuming \( P(D \mid CS) \) is several times higher than \( P(D \mid H) \) due to Jason's traits aligning with common characteristics of computer science professors:

\[
P(CS \mid D) \approx \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.25}{0.75 \cdot 0.25 + 0.25 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.1875}{0.1875 + 0.1875} = \frac{0.1875}{0.375} = 0.5
\]

Given that \( P(D \mid CS) \) is higher than \( P(D \mid H) \), we adjust our estimate upwards from 0.5:

\[
\text{A reasonable estimate for } P(CS \mid D) \text{ is: } \approx 0.8
\]

So the posterior probability, taking into considerations the higher likelihood traits, is:
