To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here is how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total professors \( = 25 + 75 = 100 \).

   Therefore:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability that a randomly selected professor teaches computer science).
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly selected professor teaches humanities).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

   Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing), it is more likely he is a computer science professor. Although we do not have exact numbers, we can qualitatively assess that \( P(D|CS) \) would be higher than \( P(D|H) \).

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where,
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

4. **Estimate the Likelihoods:**
   Let's assume qualitative estimates based on the described preferences:
   - Let \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \)
   - Let \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \)

5. **Calculate:**

   \[
   P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
