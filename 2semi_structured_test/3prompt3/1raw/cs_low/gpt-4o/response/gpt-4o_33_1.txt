To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason's given description.

First, we'll evaluate the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \)**:
   - Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Thus, \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - The probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
   - Let's assume this probability is high because Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align well with computer science traits. We'll estimate it to be around 0.8.

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \)**:
   - The probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.
   - Given Jason's interests, this is likely lower. Let's estimate it to be around 0.1.

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - The total probability of the description B occurring in either group.
   - Using the law of total probability: \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \).
   - Thus, \( P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \).
   - \( P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.727.
