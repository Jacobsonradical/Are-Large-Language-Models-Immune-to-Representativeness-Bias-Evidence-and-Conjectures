{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are desirable in academics across disciplines. Without any specific hints, I would default to the base rate, which is 25/100, or 0.25.
