{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and doesn't contain any specific details that would be more characteristic of one field or the other. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
