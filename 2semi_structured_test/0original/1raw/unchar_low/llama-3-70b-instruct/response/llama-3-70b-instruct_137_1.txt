{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that specifically suggests Jason is a computer science professor (e.g., no mention of technical skills or interests), I would default to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
