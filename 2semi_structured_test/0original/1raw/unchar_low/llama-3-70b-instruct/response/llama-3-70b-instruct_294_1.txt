{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked, having high ability, and being motivated, are not unique to either field. Therefore, I would default to the base rate, which is 25% since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
