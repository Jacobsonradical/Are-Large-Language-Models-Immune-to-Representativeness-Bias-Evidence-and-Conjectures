{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, are not unique to either field and could be applicable to successful professors in general. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample (25 out of 100).
