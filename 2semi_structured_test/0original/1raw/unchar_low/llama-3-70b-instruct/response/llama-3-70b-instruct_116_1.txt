{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only provides general information about Jason's personal life and personality, which does not seem to be related to his field of study. Therefore, I would assume that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
