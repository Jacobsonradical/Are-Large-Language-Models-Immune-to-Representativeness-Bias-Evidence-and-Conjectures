{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description focuses on personal characteristics and general professional reputation, which do not seem to be field-specific. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
