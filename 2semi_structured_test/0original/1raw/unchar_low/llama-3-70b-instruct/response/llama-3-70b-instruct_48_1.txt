{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked, having high ability, and strong motivation, are not specific to either field. Therefore, I default to the base rate, which is 25/100, or 0.25.
