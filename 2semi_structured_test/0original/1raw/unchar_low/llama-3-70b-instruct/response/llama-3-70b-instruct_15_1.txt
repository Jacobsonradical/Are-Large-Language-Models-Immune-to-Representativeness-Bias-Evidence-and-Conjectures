{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and doesn't provide any clues about Jason's field of study. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor given that there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in the sample.
