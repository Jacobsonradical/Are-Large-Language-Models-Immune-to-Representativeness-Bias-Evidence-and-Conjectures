{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (ability, motivation, being well-liked) are not specific to either field, and the demographic information (age, marital status, lack of children) is also not informative. Therefore, I default to the base rate probability, which is 25% since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
