{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that suggests a specific field of study, I would assume that Jason is equally likely to be from either group. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample (25 out of 100).
