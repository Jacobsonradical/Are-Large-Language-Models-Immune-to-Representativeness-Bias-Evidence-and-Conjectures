{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description is quite general and doesn't provide any specific clues about his field of expertise. Therefore, I would assign a probability based on the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is 25/100 or 0.25.
