{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) are not specific to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
