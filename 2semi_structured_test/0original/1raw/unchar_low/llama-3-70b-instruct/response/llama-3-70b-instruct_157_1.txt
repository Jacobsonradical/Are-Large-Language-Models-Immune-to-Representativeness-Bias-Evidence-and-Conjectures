{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and could apply to a professor in either field. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, I default to a probability of 0.25.
