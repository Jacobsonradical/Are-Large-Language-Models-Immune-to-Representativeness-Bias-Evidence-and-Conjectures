{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are likely to be common among successful academics in general, and do not provide any specific clues about Jason's field of study. Therefore, I default to the base rate, which is 25% since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in the sample.
