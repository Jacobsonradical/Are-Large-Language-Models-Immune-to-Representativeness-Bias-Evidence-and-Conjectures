{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, are likely to be common among successful academics in general, regardless of their field. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
