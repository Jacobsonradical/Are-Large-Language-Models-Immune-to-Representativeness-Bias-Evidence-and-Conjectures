{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: Since there is no information in the description that specifically suggests Jason is a computer science professor (e.g., no mention of technical skills, research interests, etc.), I would default to the base rate probability, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, i.e., 25/100 = 0.25.
