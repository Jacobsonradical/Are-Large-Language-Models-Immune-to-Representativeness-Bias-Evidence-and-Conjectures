{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only provides general information about Jason's personal life and personality traits, which does not seem to be correlated with a specific field of study. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample (25 out of 100).
