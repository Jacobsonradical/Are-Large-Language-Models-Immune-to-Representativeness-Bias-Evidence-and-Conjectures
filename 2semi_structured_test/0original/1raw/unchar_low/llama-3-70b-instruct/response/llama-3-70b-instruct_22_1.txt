{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific details that would hint at his field of expertise. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is equivalent to a random guess given that there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
