{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that is specific to computer science or the humanities, I should rely on the base rate of the two groups. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
