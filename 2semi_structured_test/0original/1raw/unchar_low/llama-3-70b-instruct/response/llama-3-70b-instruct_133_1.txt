{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that is specific to computer science or humanities, I would assume that Jason is equally likely to be from either field. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
