{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (ability, motivation, being well-liked) are not specific to either field. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate for Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
