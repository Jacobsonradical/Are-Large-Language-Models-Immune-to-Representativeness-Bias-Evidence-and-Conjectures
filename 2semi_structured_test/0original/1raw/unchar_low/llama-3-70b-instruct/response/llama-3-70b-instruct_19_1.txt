{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked, having high ability, and being motivated, are not specific to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
