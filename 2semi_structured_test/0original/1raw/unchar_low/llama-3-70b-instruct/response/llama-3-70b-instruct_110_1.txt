{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked and having high ability and strong motivation, are not specific to either field. Therefore, I would assume the probability is equal to the base rate, which is 25/100 = 0.25, since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
