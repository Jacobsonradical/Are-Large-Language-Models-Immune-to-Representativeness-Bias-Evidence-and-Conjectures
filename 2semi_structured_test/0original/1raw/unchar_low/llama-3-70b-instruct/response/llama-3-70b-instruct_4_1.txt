{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and does not provide any specific details that would be more characteristic of one field or the other. Therefore, I defaulted to the base rate probability, which is 25/100 = 0.25, since 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science.
