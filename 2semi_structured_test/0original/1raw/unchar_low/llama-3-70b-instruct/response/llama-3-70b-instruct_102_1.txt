{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: There is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only provides general information about Jason's personal life and personality traits, which are not specific to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is equivalent to a random guess given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
