{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description only mentions general traits such as ability, motivation, and likability, which could be applicable to professors in either field. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
