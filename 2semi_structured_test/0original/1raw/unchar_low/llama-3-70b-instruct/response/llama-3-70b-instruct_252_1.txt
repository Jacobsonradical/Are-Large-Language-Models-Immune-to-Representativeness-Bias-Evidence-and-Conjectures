{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: There is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked and having high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor given that there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the sample.
