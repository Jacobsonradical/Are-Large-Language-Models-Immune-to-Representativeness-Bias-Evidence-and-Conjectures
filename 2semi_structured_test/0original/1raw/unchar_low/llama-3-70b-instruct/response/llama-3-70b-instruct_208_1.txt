{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description focuses on his personal characteristics, such as his age, marital status, and personality traits, which do not provide any clues about his field of expertise. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor given that 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are from computer science.
