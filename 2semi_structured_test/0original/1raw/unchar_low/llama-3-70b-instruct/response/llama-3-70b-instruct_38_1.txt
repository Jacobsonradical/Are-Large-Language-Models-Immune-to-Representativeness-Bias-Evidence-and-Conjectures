{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked by colleagues and having high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field. Therefore, I default to the base rate probability, which is 25/100 or 0.25, since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
