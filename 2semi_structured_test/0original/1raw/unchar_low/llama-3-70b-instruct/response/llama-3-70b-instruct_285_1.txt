{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description only provides demographic information and personality traits that could be applicable to professors in either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor given that there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the sample.
