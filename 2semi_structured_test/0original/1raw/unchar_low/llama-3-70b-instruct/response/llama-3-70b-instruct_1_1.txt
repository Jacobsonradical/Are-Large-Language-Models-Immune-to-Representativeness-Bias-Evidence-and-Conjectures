{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked by colleagues and having high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful academics in general, regardless of their field. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
