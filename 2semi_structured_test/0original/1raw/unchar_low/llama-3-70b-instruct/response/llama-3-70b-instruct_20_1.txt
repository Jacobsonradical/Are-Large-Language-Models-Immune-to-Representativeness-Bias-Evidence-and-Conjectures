{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: There is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, are not specific to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.25, which is the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor given that there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the sample.
