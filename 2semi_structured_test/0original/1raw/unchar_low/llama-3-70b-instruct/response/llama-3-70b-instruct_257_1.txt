{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, are not unique to either field. Therefore, I defaulted to the base rate probability, which is 25/100 = 0.25, since 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
