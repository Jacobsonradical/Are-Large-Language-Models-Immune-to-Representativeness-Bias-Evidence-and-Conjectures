{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked and having high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field. Therefore, I would assign a probability equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
