{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that suggests a specific field of study, I would assume that Jason is equally likely to be from either group. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate for computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25.
