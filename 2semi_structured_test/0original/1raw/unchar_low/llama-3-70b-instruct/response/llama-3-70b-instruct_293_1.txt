{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that suggests a specific field of study, I would assume that Jason has an equal chance of being in either group. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor would be 25/100 = 0.25.
