{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: since there is no information in the description that specifically suggests Jason is a computer science professor (e.g., no mention of technical skills or interests), and given that the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25% (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science), I would stick with the prior probability.
