{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as being well-liked, motivated, and having a positive reputation, are not specific to either field. Therefore, I defaulted to the base rate probability, which is 25/100 = 0.25, since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in the sample.
