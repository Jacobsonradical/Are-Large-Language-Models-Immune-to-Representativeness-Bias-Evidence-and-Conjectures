{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is as follows: Since there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor, I would default to the base rate probability, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total, the base rate probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
