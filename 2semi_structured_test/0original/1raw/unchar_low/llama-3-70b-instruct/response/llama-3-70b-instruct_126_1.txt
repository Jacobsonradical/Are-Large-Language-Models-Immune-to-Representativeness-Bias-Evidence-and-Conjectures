{"probability": 0.25}

My reasoning is as follows: there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only provides demographic and personality information that is not specific to either field. Therefore, I default to the base rate probability, which is 25/100 = 0.25, since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total.
