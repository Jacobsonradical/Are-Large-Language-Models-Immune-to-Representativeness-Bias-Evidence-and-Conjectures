{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (ability, motivation, being well-liked) are not specific to one field or the other, and the demographic information (age, marital status, lack of children) is also not informative. Therefore, I default to the base rate, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
