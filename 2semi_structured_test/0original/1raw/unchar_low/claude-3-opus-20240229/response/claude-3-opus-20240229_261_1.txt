To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the information provided in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study.

Without additional information strongly suggesting Jason's field, we should base our probability estimate on the base rates in the sample.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
