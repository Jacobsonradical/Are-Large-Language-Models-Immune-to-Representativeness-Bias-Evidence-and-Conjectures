Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Without additional information on Jason's specific area of expertise, research focus, or other distinguishing characteristics between the two groups of professors in the study, the probability of him being a computer science professor should be based on the base rates provided in the sample. Since the sample includes 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%.
