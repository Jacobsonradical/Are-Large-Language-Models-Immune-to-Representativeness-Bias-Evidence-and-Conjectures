To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes. The correct approach is to look at the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Since no additional information is given about Jason that would allow us to update this prior probability, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains at 0.25, or 25%.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
