To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is therefore 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. His personality traits seem fairly generic and could apply to successful professors in many fields. The description does not mention any computer science specific traits or interests.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
