To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so without any other information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to sway us from this base rate. The details about his age, marital status, reputation, and lack of children do not clearly distinguish him as more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, it is reasonable to stick close to the base rate or prior probability. Therefore, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}
