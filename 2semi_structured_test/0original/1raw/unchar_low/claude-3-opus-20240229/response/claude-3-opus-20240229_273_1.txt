Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a strong inference about Jason's field of study. The description does not include any details that clearly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess Jason's field based only on the prior probabilities, I would estimate a 25% chance that he is a computer science professor.

However, I do not have enough specific evidence to deviate substantially from this baseline probability. Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
