To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate in the sample. The details about his age, marital status, reputation, and motivation do not clearly distinguish him as belonging to one group or the other based on the given information.
