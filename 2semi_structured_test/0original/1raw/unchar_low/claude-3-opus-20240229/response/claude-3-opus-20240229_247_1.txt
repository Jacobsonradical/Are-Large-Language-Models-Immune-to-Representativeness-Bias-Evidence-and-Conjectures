Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful tenured professors in many fields.

Given that the study sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor, absent any other information, would be 25%. 

However, the description gives no specific indication of Jason's field. More relevant information, such as Jason's research focus, publication record, or teaching areas would be needed to shift the probability meaningfully away from the baseline.

Therefore, based on the information given, I estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.25"}
