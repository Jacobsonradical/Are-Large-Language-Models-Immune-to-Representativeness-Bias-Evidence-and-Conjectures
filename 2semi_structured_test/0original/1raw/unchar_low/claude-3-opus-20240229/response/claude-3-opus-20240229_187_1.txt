To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the limited information provided and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any information directly related to his field of study.

Without additional information specifically indicating Jason's field, the best we can do is assign probabilities based on the relative proportions of the two groups in the study.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this study is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
