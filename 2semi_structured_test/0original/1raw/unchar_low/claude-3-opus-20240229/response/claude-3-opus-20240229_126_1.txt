To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability. His traits of being highly able, motivated, and well-liked could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, in the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate.
