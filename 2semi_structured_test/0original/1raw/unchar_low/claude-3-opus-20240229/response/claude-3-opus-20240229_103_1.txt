To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is:

P(Computer Science) = 25/100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to sway this probability in either direction. His age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation do not clearly distinguish him as more likely to be from one field or the other.

In the absence of further field-specific information, the base rate is the best probability estimate.
