To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate:

{"probability": "0.25"}
