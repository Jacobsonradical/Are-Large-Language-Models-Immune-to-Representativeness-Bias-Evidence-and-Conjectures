Jason's description does not provide any clear indication of whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description focuses on his personality traits, which could apply to successful academics in either field.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

25 / (25 + 75) = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
