To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(computer science professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description provided does not contain any specific information that would strongly indicate whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should align with the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
