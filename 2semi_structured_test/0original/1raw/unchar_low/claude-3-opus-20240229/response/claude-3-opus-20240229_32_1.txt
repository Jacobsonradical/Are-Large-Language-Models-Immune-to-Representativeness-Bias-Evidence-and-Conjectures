To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence that he's more likely to be from one field or the other. He's described as highly able, motivated and well-liked, traits that could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing evidence, we should defer to the base rates. Since 25% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, that should be our estimated probability that a randomly selected professor from the group is a computer science professor.
