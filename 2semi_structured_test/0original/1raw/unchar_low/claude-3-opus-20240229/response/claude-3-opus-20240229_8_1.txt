Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention any field-specific traits or inclinations.

However, given that the sample consisted of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this base rate is the best estimate.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
