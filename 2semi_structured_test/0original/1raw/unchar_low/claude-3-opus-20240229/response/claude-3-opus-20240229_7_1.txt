To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would make him more likely to be from one group or the other, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
