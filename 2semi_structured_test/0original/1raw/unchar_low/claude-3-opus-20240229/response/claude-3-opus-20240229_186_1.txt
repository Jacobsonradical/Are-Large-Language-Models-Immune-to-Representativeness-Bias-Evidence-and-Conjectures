To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the provided information about the base rates of professors in each field, rather than stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason was chosen at random from the 100 total descriptions.

Using this information, we can calculate the probability:

P(Computer Science | Jason's description) = P(Jason's description | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science) / P(Jason's description)

Since the description was chosen at random, P(Jason's description | Computer Science) = P(Jason's description | Humanities) = P(Jason's description).

Therefore, the probability simplifies to:
P(Computer Science | Jason's description) = P(Computer Science) = 25/100 = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
