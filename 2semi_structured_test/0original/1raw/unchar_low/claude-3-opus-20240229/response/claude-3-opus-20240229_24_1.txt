To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - in this case, the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- Total sample size: 100 professors
- Computer science professors: 25
- Humanities professors: 75

The prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would lead us to update this prior probability. His age, marital status, lack of children, high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation could apply equally to professors in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains at the base rate of 0.25.
