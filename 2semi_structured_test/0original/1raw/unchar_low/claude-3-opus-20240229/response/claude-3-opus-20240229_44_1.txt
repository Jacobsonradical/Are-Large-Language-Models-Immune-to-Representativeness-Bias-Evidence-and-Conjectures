To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- Total professors in the study: 100
- Computer science professors: 25
- Humanities professors: 75

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to suggest he's more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the prior probability. His traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked seem quite general and applicable across disciplines.

Therefore, in the absence of additional distinguishing information, it is reasonable to stick with the base rate probability.
