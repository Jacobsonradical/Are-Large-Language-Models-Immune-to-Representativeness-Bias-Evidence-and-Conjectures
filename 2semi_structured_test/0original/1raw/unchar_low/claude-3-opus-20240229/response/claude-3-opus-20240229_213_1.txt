To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits of professors in different fields. The correct probability is simply based on the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(computer science professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, without any additional relevant information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
