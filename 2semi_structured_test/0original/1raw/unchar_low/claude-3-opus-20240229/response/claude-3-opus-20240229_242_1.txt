Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to confidently determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field, research interests, or educational background that would allow us to make an informed guess.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if we had to make a probability estimate based purely on the base rates, there would be a 25% chance (25 out of 100) that any randomly selected professor from the sample is in computer science.

However, since the question is asking for a subjective probability estimate, I will provide my answer in the requested format while acknowledging the high level of uncertainty:

{"probability": "0.3"}
