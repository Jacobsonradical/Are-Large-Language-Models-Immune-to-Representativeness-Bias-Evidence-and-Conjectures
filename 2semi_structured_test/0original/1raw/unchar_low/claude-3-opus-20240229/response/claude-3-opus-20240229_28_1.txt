To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional information specific to Jason that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
