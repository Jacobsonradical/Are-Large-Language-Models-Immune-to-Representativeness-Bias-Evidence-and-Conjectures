To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the base rates provided in the problem setup.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any specific information in Jason's description that clearly identifies him as a computer science or humanities professor, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
