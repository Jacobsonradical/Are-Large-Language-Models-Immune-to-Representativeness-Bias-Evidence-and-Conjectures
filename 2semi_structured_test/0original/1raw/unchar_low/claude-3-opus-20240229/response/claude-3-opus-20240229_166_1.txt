To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 25 of the professors are in computer science
- 75 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample

The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The details about his age, marital status, reputation, ability and motivation do not clearly distinguish between the two fields.

In the absence of additional diagnostic information, it is rational to defer to the base rate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the prior probability of 0.25.
