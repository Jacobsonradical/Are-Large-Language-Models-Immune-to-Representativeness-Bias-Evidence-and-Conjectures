To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

So the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. It contains general positive traits that could apply to successful professors in many fields. There's no information clearly indicating Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Therefore, in the absence of further distinguishing evidence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
