From the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason does not include any clear indicators of his specific academic field.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this is the probability I would assign.
