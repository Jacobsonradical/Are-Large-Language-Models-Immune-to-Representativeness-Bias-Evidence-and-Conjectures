To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personal characteristics could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 25%.
