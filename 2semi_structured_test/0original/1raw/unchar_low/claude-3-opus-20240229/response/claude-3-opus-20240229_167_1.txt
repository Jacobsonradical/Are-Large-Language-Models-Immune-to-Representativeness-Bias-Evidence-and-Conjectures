Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field or any field-related characteristics.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 25%. 

So without any other distinguishing information, the probability estimate should be close to this base rate.
