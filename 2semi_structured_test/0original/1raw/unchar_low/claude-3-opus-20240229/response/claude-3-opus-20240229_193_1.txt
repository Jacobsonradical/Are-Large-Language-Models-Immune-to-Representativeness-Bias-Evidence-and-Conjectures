To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample:
- 25 are tenured and successful computer science professors
- 75 are tenured and successful humanities professors

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason provides no information that would indicate he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His description could apply equally well to a successful professor in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of any distinguishing evidence, the probability remains the base rate of 0.25.
