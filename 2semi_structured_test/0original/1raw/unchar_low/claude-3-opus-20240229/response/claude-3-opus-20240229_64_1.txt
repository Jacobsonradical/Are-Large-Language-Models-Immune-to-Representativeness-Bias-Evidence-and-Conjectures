To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or unrelated information. Instead, let's focus on the relevant data provided:

- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any information directly indicating his field of study.

Without additional field-specific information about Jason, we have no strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be from one group or the other. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rates in the sample:

- P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Given this reasoning, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
