To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked - could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

So, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
