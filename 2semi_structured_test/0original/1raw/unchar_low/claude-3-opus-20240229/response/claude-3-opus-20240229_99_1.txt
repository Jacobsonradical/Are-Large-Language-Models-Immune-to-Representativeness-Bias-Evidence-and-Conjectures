To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different academic fields. The correct approach is to consider the base rates provided in the problem description.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors. Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25, or 25%.
