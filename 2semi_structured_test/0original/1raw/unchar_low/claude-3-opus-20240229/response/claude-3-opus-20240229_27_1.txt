To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative frequency of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason that would indicate his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
