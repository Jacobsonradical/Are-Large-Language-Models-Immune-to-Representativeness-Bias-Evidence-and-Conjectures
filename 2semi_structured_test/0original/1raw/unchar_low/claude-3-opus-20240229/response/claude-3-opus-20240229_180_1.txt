To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields. The correct approach is to look at the base rates provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason is randomly selected from this sample of 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason relevant to his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
