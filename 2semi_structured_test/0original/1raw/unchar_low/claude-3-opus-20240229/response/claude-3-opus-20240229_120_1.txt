To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description could apply equally well to a successful professor in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate.

{"probability": "0.25"}
