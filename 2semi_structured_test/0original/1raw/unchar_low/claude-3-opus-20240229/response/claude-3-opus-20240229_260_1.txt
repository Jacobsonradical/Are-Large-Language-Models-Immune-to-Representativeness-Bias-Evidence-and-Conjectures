Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field or academic background.

However, given that the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we can calculate the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor as 25/100 = 0.25.

Without additional distinguishing information, our best estimate is this prior probability.

{"probability": "0.25"}
