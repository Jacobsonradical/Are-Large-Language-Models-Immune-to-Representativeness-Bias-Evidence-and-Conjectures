To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that a randomly selected description belongs to a computer science professor is:
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
