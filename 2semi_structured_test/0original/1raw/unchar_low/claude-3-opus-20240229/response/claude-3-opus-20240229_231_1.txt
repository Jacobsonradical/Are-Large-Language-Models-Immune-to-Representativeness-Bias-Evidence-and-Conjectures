To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so without any additional information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Given the lack of field-specific information in the description, our best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 0.25.
