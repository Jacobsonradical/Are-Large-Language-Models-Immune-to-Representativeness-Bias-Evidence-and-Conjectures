To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear indication that he's more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked - could apply to successful professors in either field.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the best estimate is the base rate probability.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
