To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

In the sample of 100 professors, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the base rate is the best probability estimate.
