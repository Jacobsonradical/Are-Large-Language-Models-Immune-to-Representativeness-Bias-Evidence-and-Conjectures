To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. His traits of being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities. The description doesn't mention any computer science specific traits or interests.

Therefore, without additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
