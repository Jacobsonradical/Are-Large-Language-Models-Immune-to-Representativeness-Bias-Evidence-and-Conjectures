To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors studied, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that are specifically associated with computer science or humanities, the probability that he is a computer science professor should align with the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
