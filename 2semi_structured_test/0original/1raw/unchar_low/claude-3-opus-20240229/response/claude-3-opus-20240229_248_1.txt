To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- Jason's description does not include any information directly related to his field of study.

Without additional information specific to computer science or the humanities, we can only base our probability estimate on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
