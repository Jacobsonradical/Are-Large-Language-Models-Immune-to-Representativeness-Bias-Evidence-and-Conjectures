To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - that is, the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

So the base rate or prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to update this prior probability. While it describes him positively, the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities. The description does not contain any information clearly pointing to one field or the other.

Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing evidence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
