To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. The description does not provide any definitive information about his field of study. The only relevant information given is the base rate, or prior probability, of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100.

Therefore, in the absence of any additional diagnostic information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is 25%, or 0.25.
