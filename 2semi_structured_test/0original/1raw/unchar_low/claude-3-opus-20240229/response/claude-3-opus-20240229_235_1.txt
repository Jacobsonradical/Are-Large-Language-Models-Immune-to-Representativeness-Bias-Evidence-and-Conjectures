To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would lead us to believe he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate.
