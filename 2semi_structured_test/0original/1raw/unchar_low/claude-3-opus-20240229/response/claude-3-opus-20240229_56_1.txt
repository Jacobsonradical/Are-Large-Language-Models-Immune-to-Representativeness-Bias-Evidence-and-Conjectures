Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description doesn't include any clear indications of his specific field.

However, since the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual from the group being a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, assigning the base rate probability is a reasonable approach.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
