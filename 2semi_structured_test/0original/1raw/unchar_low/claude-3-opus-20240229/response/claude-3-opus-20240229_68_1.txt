To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields. The description provided does not contain any specific information that would allow us to distinguish whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.

The only relevant information we have is the base rates - there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Without any other distinguishing evidence, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this group is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
