To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the information provided about the base rates of professors in each field, rather than stereotyping based on the brief description.

The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any other distinguishing information about Jason relevant to his field, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
