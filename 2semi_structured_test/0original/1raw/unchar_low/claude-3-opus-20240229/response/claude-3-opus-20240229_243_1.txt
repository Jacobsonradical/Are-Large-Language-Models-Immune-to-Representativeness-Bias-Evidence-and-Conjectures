To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 25 of the professors are in computer science
- 75 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total there are 100 professors in the sample

So, without any additional information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. His traits of being highly able, motivated, and well-liked could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
