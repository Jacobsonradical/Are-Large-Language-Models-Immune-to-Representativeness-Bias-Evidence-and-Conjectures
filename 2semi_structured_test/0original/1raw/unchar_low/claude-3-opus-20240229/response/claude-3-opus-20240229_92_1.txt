To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the study, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would make him more likely to be in one group or the other, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate:

25/100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
