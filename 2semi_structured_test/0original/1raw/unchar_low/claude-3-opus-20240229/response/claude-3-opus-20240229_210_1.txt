Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the overall sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, I would estimate the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science as 25%. This assumes no other differentiating information.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
