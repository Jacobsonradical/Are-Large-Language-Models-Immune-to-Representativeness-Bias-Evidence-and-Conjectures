To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would make him more likely to be in one group or the other, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based solely on the information given, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
