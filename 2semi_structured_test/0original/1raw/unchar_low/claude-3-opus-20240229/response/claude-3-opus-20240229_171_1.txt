To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's personality traits that might be more specific to computer science or humanities, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
