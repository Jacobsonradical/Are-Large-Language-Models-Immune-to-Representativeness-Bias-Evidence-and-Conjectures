To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional information that specifically indicates Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
