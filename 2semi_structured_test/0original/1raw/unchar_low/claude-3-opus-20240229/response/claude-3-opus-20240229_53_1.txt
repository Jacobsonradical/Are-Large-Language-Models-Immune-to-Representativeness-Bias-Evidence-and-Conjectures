To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason was randomly selected from these 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor is:
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personal characteristics could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 0.25.
