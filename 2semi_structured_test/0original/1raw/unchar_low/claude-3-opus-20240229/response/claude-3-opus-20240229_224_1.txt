To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description provided does not contain any specific information that would clearly identify Jason as belonging to either the computer science or humanities group.

Without additional distinguishing information, we can assume that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
