To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of expertise. The only relevant information given is the base rate:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Without additional distinguishing details, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based solely on the given information, the probability estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
