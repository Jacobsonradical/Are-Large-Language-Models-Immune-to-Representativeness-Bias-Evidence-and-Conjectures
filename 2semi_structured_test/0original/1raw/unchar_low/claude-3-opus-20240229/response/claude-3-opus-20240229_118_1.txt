Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine Jason's field with high confidence. The description does not mention any characteristics that are clearly associated with computer science or the humanities.

Some key points:
- The sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without additional distinguishing information, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%.
- Jason's age of 30 seems young for a tenured professor in either field.
- High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields.

Given the lack of field-specific clues and the 1:3 base rate of CS to humanities professors in the sample, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 25%:

{"probability": "0.25"}
