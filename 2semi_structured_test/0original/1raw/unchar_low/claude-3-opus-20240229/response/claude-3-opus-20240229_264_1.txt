To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates given in the study description.

The sample includes:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Without any additional distinguishing information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 / (25 + 75) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to shift this prior probability. His personal characteristics and reputation could apply equally well to a professor in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability estimate remains close to the base rate.

{"probability": "0.25"}
