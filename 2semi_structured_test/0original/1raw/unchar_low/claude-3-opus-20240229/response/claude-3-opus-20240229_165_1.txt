To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(computer science professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability. The description could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 0.25.
