Based on the limited information provided about Jason, it is difficult to determine with high confidence whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indicators of his specific field.

However, given that the sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this base rate is a reasonable estimate.
