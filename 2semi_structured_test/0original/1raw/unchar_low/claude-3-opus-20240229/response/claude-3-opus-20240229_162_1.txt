To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, our best estimate is the base rate probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
