To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 25 tenured and successful computer science professors
- 75 tenured and successful humanities professors
- Total sample size: 100 professors

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
