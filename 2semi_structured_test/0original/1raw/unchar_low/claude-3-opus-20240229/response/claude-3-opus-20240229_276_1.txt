To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to suggest he's more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or humanities.

Without additional distinguishing information, we should defer to the base rate. So the probability Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability.
