Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field, and the personality traits listed could apply to successful individuals in many academic disciplines.

Given that the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 25%, or 0.25.

Without additional field-specific details, the responsible answer is to not deviate far from this baseline probability.

{"probability": "0.3"}
