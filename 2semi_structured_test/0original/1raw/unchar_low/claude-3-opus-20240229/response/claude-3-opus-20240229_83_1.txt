To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 25 of the professors are in computer science
- 75 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total there are 100 professors

So the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to sway us from this base rate. While he is described positively, the traits mentioned could apply equally to professors in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of further distinguishing information, our estimate should stick close to the base rate.
