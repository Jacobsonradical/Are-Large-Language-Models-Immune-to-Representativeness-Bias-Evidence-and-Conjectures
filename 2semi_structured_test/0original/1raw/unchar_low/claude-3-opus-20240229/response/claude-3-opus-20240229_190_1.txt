To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study.

Given:
- The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of study.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
