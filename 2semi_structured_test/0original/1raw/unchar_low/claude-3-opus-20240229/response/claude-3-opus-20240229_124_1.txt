To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
