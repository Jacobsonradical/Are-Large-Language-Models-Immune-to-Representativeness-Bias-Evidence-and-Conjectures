To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of study. The only relevant statistical information given is that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Without additional distinguishing details, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
