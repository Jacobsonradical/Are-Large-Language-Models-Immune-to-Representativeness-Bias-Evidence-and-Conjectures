To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the study description.

The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional information about Jason, the prior probability of him being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
