To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the information provided and avoid common cognitive biases like base rate neglect.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any strong indication of his field.

Without additional field-specific information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be based on the base rates in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, there is a 25% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

{"probability": "0.25"}
