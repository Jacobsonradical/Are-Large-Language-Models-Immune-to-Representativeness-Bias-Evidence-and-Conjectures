While the description of Jason provides some relevant information, it does not contain enough specific details to confidently determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description could plausibly fit either a computer science or humanities professor.

Given that the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess based only on the base rates, there would be a 25% chance that a randomly selected professor from the sample would be from computer science.

So in the absence of clear distinguishing information, I'll go with that base rate probability:

{"probability": "0.25"}
