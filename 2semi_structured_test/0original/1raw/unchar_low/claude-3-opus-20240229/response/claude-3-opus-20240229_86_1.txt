To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues - could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of additional field-specific information, the base rate is the best estimate of the probability.
