To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to the total number of professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personal characteristics could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately equal to the base rate of 0.25.
