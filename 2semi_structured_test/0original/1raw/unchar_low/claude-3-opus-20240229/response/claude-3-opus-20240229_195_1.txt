To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked - could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the base rate is the best estimate of the probability. Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
