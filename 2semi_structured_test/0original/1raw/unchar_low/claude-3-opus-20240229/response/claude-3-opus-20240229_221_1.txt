To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of professors in each field in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would indicate his field, we can only make a judgment based on the base rates.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
