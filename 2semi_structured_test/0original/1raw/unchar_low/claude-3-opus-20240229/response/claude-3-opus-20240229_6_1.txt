To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would indicate he's more likely to be in one field or the other. His personal characteristics could apply equally to a professor in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
