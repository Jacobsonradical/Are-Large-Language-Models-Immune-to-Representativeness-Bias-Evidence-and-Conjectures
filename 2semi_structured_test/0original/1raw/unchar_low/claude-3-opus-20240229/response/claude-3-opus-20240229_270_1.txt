To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the study, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason, while positive, does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues - could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should reflect the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
