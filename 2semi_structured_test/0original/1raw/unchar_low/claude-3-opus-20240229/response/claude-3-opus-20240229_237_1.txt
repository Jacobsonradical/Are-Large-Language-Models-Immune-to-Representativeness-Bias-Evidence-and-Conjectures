To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to the total number of professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
