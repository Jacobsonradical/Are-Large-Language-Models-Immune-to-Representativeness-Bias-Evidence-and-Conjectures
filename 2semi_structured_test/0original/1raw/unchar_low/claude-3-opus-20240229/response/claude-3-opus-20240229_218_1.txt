To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
25 / 100 = 0.25 or 25%

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 25%.
