To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the base rates provided in the problem description.

Given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would help us determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, without additional relevant information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
