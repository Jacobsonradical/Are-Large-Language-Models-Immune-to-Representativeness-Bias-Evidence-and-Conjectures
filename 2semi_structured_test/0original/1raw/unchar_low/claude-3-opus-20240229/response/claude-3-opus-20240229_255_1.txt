To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Key points:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study.

Given that there is no specific information about Jason's field, we should base our probability estimate on the base rates in the sample. Since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

Therefore, without additional information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
