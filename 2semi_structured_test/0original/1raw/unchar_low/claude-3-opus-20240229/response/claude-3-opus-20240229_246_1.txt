To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes and instead focus on the base rate information provided.

The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is:

25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. His personal characteristics could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability estimate should be close to the base rate of 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
