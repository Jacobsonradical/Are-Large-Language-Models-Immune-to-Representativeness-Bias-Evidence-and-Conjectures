To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the information given and avoid common cognitive biases such as the base rate fallacy.

Key points:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any information specific to his field of study.

Without additional field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
