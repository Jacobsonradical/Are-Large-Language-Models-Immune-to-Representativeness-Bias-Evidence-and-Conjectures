To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / (25 + 75) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
