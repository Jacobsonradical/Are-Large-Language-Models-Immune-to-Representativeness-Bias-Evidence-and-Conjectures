To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would suggest he's more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
