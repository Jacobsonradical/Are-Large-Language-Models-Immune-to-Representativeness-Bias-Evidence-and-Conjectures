To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in the humanities.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of distinguishing information, we should defer to the base rates. Since only 25% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
