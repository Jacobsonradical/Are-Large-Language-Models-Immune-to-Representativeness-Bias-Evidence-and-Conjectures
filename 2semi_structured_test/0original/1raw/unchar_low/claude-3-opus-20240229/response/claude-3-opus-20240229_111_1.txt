Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Without additional information more specifically related to his area of study, the best we can do is assume the probability matches the base rates in the sample - there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 25%.
