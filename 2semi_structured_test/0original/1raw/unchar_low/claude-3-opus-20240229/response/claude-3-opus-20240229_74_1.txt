To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description provided does not contain any information specific to either field.

The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25/100 = 0.25, or 25%.

Since the description does not provide any field-specific information that would alter the base rate probability, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
