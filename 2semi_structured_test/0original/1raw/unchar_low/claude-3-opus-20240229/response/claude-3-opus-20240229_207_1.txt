To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative frequencies of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
