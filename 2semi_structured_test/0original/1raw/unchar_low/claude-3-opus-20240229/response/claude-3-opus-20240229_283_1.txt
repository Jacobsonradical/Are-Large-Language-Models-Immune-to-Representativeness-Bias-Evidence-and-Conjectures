To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the prior probabilities before considering the specific description.

In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, without any other information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he's more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific diagnostic information in the description, we should defer to the base rates. So my estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25, matching the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample.
