To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to the total number of professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description focuses on his personality traits, which could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
