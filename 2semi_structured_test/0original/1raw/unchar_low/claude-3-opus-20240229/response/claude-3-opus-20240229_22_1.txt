To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates - the relative sizes of the two groups in the sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is:

25 / (25 + 75) = 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he's more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues are traits that could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the base rates provide the best estimate of the probability.
