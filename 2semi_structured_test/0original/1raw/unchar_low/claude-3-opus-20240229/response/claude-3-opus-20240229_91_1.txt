To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would make him more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor, we can only base our judgment on the relative frequencies of the two groups in the sample.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
