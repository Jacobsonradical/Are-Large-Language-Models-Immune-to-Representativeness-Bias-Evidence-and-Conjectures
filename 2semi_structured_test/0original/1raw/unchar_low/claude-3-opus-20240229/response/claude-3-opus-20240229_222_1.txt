To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Key points:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any specific information about his field of study or research.

Given that there is no field-specific information in Jason's description, the best estimate of the probability that he is a computer science professor is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25, or 25%

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
