To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in the humanities.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more likely to be in one field or the other. His personal characteristics and reputation could apply equally to a successful professor in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing evidence, we should defer to the base rates. Since 25% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science is 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
