To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates given in the problem. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
