To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, as well as any relevant information provided in Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not provide any clear indication of Jason's field of study.

Without additional information specific to computer science or the humanities, we should assign the probability based on the base rates in the sample.

Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
