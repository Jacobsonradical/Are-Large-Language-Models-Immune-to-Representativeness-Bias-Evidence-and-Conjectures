To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(computer science professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
