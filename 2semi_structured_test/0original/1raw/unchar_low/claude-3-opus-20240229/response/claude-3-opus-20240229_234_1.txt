To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the provided information:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not contain any information directly related to Jason's field of study.

Without additional information specifically indicating Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the composition of the sample. Since 25 out of the 100 professors are computer science professors, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
