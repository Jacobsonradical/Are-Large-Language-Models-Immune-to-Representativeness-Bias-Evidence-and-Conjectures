To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of Jason being a computer science professor, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description provided about Jason does not give any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 0.25, or 25%.
