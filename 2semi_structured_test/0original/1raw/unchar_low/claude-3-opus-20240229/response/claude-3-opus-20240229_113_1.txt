To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:
P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The description could apply to a successful professor in either field.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best estimated by the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
