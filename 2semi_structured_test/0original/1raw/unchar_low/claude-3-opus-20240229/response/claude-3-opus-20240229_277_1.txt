To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions, and instead focus on the base rates provided in the study description.

The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues do not specifically point to either field.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.25"}
