To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not contain any information directly related to Jason's field of study.

Without additional information specifically indicating Jason's field, we can base our probability estimate on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
