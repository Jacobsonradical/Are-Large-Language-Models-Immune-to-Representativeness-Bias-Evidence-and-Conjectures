Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being well-liked, highly capable and motivated could apply to successful professors in many fields.

However, since the sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess, the baseline probability of Jason being a computer science professor would be 25%, given no other information.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
