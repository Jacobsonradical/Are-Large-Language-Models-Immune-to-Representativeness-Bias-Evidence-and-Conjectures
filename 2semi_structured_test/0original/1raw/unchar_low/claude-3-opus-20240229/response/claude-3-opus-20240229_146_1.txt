To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

So the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to update this prior probability. It doesn't mention his field, and the traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

In the absence of diagnostic information to shift the prior probability, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
