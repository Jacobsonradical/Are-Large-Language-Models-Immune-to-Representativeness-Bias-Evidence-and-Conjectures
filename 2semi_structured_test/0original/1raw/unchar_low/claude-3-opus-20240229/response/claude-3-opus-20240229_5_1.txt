To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description does not include any information directly related to Jason's field of study.

Without additional field-specific information, we can only base our probability estimate on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
