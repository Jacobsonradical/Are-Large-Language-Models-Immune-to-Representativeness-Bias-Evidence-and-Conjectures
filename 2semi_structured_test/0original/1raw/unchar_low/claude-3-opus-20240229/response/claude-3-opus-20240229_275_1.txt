To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 25 professors in the sample are in computer science
- 75 professors in the sample are in the humanities
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would indicate his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
