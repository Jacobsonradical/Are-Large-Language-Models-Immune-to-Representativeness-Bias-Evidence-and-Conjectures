To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors in total

Therefore, without considering any specific information about Jason, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of additional diagnostic information, it is reasonable to stick close to the base rate or prior probability.
