To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would indicate his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate:

25 / 100 = 0.25

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
