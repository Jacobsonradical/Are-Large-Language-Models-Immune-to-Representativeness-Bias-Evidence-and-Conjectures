To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's personality traits that might be more specific to computer science or humanities professors, the best estimate would be the base rate probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 25/100 or 0.25.
