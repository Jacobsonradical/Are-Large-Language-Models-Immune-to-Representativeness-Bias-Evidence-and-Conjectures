To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of study. The only relevant information given is the base rate: 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science.

Therefore, in the absence of any additional diagnostic information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
