To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This is an application of the base rate, or prior probability, which is an important concept in Bayesian reasoning. The description provided about Jason does not give us any specific information to differentiate him as being more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor, so our best estimate is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
