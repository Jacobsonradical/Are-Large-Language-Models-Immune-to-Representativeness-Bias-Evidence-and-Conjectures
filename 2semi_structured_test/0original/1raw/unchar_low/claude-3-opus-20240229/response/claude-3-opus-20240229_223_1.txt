Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to conclude whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Without additional information more specific to Jason's field of study, the probability of him being a computer science professor should be based on the baseline proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 25%.
