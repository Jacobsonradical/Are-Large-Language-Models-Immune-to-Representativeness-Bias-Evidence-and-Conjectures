To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear indication that he's more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without additional distinguishing information, the best estimate is the base rate: the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
