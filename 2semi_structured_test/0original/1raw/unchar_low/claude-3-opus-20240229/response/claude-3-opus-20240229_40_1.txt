Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

The description of Jason provides no information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues could apply equally to professors in either field.

The only relevant information given is the base rates - there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Without any other distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
