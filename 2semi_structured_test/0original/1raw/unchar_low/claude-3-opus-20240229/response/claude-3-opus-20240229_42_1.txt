To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. It describes general positive traits that could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific diagnostic information, we should defer to the base rate probability. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
