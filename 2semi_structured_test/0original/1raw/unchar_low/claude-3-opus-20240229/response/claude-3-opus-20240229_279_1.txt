To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:
P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25

Since the description does not give us any additional information to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 0.25.
