To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description provided does not contain any information specifically related to Jason's field of study.

Without additional information directly linking Jason to either field, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
