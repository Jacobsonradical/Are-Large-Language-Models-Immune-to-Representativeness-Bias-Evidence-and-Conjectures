Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being well-liked, highly capable and motivated could apply to successful professors in either field.

Without additional information on the specific traits that differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors in the sample, the prior probabilities should be used. Since the sample contained 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%.
