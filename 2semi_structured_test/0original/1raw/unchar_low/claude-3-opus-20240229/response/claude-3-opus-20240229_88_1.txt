To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Given:
- The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description does not include any specific information about his field of study.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, we should base our probability estimate on the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
