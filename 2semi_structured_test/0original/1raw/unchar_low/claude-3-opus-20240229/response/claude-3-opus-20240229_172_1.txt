To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate.
