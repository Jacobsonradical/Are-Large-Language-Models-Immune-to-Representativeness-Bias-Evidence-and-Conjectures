To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of the two groups in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate his field of study.

Without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.25 or 25%.
