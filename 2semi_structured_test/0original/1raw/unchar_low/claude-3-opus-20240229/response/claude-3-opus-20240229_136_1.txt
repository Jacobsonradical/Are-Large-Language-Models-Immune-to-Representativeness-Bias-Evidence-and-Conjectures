To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rate or prior probability. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Given no other information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional information that specifically indicates Jason's field, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate:

{"probability": "0.25"}
