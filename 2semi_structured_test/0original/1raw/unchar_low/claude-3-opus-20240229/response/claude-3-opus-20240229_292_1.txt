To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability of a randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is:
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description includes general positive traits that could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, our best estimate is the base rate probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
