To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions, and instead base it on the statistical information provided.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- No information in Jason's description is directly related to his field of study.

Without additional relevant information to differentiate between the two groups, the probability should be based on the relative sizes of the groups in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25 or 25%.
