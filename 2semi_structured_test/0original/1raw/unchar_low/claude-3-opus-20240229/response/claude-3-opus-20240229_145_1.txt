To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description provided does not contain any information specific to either field.

Without additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
