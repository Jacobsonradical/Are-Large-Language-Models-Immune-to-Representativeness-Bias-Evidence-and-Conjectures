To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. Instead, let's focus on the relevant information provided:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not contain any information clearly indicating whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor.

Given the lack of distinguishing details in the description, our best estimate is based on the relative proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
