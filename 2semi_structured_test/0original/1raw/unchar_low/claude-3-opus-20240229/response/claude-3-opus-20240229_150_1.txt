Based on the limited information provided in the description, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field of study or research interests.

However, given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this is a reasonable estimate.
