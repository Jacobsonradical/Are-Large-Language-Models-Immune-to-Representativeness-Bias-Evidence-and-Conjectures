To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the information given and avoid common cognitive biases like the base rate fallacy.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description provided does not contain any specific information about Jason's field of study.

Without additional distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor should align with the base rate, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability calculation:
P(Computer Science Professor) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
