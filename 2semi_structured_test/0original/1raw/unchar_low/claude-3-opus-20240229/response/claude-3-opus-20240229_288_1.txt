To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain at the base rate.
