To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes. The question only provides the base rates: 25% of the professors in the sample are in computer science (25 out of 100) while 75% are in humanities.

The description of Jason does not contain any information specifically indicating whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. His traits like being motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of 25%, or 0.25.
