Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field, research interests, or academic background that would allow us to lean strongly in either direction.

Given that the overall sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of a randomly selected individual from the group being a computer science professor is 25%. In the absence of additional distinguishing information, this prior probability is a reasonable estimate.
