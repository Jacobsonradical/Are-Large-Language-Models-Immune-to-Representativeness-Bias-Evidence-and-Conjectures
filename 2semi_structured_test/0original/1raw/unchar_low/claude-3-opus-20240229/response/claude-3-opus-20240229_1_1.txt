Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field, and the qualities listed (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Given that the sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. Without additional field-specific information to go on, this base rate is a reasonable estimate.
