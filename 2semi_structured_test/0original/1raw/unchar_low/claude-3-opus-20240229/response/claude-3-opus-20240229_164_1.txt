To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or unsupported assumptions. The appropriate probability to assign is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the overall sample, assuming the description provided does not give clear evidence to shift the probability either way.

In the study, out of 100 professors total, 25 were computer science professors and 75 were humanities professors.

Therefore, absent any other differentiating information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
