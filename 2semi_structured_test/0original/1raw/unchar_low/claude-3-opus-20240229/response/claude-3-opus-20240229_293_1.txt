Based on the limited information provided, it's impossible to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor with confidence. The description doesn't mention his field of study, research interests, or any other characteristics that would suggest he is more likely to be in computer science vs. the humanities.

Given that the overall sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess, I would say there is a 25% chance (25/100 = 0.25) that a randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science. But this is just the base rate, not taking into account any specifics of Jason's description.

So in the requested format, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

But I want to emphasize that this is a guess based on extremely limited information. The details provided about Jason do not give enough basis to adjust the probability away from the baseline ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample.
