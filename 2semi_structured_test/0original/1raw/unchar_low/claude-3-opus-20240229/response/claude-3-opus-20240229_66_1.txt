To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the problem.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any specific information about his field of study.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
