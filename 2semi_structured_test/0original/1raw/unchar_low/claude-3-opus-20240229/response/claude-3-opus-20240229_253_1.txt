To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the study, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would make him more likely to be in one group or the other, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25/100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
