To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 25 of the professors are in computer science
- 75 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total there are 100 professors in the sample

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personality traits seem fairly generic and could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific evidence pointing to computer science or humanities, we should defer to the base rate probability.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
