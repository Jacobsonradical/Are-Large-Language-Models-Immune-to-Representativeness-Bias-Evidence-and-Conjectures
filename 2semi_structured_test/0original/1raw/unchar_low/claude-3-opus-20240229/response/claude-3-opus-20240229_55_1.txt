To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the provided information in the context of the study.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any specific information about his field of study.

Without additional information directly relating to Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the relative proportion of computer science professors in the study.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
