To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

Without additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked and having a positive reputation - could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the base rate is the best probability estimate.
