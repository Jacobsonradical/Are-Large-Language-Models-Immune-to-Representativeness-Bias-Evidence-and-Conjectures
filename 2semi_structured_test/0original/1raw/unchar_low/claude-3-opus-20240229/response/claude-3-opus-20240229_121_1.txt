Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine Jason's field with high confidence. The description does not mention any field-specific traits that would clearly indicate whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor.

Given that the overall sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 25%. 

Without additional distinguishing information, the most reasonable estimate is this base rate probability. So my probability estimate that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
