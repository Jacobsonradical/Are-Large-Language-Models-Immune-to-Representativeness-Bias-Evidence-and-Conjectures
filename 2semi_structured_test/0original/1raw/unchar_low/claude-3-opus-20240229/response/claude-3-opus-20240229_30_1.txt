To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should rely on the base rate information provided:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- This means that the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, it is reasonable to defer to the base rate probability. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is close to the prior probability of 0.25.
