To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study setup.

The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of more specific information, the base rate probability of 0.25 remains the best estimate.
