Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy. The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The only relevant information given is the base rates - there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, absent any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
