Based on the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description doesn't include any clear indication of his field.

However, given that the sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this is the probability I would assign.
