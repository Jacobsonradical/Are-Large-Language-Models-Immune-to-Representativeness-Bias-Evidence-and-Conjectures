To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific diagnostic information, our best estimate of the probability is the base rate.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
