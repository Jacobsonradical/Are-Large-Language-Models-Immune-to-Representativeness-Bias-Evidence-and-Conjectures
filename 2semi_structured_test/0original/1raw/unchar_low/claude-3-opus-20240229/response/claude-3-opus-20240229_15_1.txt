Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Given that the study sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%, if no other information is considered.

So without making strong assumptions, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.25:

{"probability": "0.25"}
