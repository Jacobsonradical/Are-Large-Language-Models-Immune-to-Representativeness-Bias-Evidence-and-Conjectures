To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence that he is more likely to be from one field or the other. His traits of being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing evidence, we should defer to the base rates. Since 25% of the sample are computer science professors, the probability Jason is a computer science professor is 25% or 0.25.
