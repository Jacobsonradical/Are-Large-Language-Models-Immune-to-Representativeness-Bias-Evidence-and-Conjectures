To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to the total number of professors in the sample.

Given:
- 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science
- 75 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
