Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Given that the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor would be 0.25 based on the base rates alone, absent any other distinguishing information.
