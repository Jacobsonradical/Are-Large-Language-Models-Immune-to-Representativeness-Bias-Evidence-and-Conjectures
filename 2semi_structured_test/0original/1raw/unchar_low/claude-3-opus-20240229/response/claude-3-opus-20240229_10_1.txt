To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason was randomly selected from these 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personality traits and characteristics could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate.
