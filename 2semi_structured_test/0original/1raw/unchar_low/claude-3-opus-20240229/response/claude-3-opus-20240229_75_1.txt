To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so without any additional information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence pointing to either field, we should defer to the base rate probability.
