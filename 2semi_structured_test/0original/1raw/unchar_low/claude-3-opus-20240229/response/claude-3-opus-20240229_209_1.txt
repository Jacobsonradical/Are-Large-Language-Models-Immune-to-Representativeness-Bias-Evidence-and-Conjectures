Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in many fields.

However, since the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. Absent other distinguishing information, this would be a reasonable estimate.

Therefore, my assessment is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
