To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 25 of the professors are in computer science
- 75 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total there are 100 professors in the sample

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason relevant to his field, the probability he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

Therefore, there is a 25% probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the information given.

{"probability": "0.25"}
