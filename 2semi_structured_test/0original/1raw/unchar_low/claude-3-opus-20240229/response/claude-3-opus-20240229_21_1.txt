To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors 
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personality traits seem quite general and could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific diagnostic information, our best estimate of the probability is the base rate.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
