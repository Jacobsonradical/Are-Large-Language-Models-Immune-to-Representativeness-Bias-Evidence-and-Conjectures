To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates provided.

Given:
- The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description does not contain any specific information about Jason's field of study.

Without additional information distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors, we can only base our probability on the relative proportions of the two groups in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
