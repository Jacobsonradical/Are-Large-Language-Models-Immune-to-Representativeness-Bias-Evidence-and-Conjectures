To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would clearly identify him as being more likely to belong to one group or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should reflect the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
