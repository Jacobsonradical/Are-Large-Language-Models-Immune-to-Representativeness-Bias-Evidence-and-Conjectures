Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful tenured professors in many fields.

Given that the study sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor from the sample being in computer science is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this prior probability is a reasonable estimate.
