Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field, and the positive traits listed could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Given that the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected professor from the sample being in computer science is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this is the probability I would assign.
