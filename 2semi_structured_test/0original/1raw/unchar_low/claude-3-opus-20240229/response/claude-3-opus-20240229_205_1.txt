To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked - could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
