Given the limited information provided about Jason, there is not enough evidence to strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field or research area.

However, since the sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of a randomly selected individual from this group being a computer science professor is 25%.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
