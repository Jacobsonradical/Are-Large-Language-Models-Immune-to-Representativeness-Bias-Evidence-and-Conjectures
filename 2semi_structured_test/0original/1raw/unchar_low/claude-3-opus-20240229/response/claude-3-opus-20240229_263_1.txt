You haven't provided enough information to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based solely on the personality description given. The description does not contain any details that clearly distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors. To provide a meaningful probability estimate, I would need to know the base rates, i.e. what proportion of the full sample of 100 professors were computer science professors vs. humanities professors. Absent that information, I'll assume the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of CS professors in the sample, 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
