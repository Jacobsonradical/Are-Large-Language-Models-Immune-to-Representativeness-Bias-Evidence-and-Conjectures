To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the available information:

- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study, as the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to professors in both computer science and humanities.

Given the lack of field-specific information in Jason's description, the best estimate of the probability that he is a computer science professor would be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
