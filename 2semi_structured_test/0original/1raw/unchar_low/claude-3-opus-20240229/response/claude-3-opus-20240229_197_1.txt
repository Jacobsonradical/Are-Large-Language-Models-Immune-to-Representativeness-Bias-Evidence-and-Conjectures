To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study description. The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rates in the sample. His personality traits and characteristics seem quite general and could apply to successful professors across various disciplines.
