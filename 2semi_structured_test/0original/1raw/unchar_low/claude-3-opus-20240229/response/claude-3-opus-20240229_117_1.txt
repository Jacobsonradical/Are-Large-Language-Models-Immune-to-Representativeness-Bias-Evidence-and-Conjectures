Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong judgments about Jason's field based on stereotypes. The description does not contain clear evidence he is more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Without more relevant data indicating the base rates of these characteristics in each field, we can only give a probability close to the baseline proportion of CS professors in the sample, which is 25%. So I'll estimate:

{"probability": "0.3"}
