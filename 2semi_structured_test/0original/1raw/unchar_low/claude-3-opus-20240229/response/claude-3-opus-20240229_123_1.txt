To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the study description and Jason's profile.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- No information in Jason's description is specifically indicative of his field of study.

Without additional information to differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
