To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or unwarranted assumptions. The correct probability is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the overall sample, assuming the description provides no additional relevant information to distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors.

In the sample, there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors. Therefore, absent any other distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
