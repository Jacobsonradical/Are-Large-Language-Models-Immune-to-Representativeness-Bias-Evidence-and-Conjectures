To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits of professors in different fields. The description provided does not contain any information specifically indicating whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.

Given the limited information, the most reasonable probability estimate is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the overall sample. There are 25 computer science professors out of the 100 total, so the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is 25%.
