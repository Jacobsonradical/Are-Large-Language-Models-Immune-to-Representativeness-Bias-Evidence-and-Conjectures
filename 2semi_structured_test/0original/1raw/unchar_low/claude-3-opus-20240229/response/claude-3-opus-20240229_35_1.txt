Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field of study.

However, since the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this would be a reasonable estimate.
