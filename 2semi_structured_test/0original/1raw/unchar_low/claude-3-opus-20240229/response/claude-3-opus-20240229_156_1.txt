Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

Without knowing the base rates of computer science vs humanities professors in the general population, the most principled guess would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This is because the sample contained 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, so in the absence of other distinguishing information, the probability of a randomly selected professor from the sample being in computer science is 25%.
