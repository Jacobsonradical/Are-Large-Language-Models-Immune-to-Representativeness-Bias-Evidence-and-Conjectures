To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions. Instead, let's focus on the key information provided:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. 
- The description of Jason does not contain any information specific to his field.

Without field-specific information to differentiate, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of CS professors in the sample:

25 / (25 + 75) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, based solely on the information given, the probability Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
