To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Given no additional information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would lead us to believe he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description focuses on his personality traits and professional reputation, which could apply to professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, without further evidence to suggest otherwise, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain at the base rate of 0.25.
