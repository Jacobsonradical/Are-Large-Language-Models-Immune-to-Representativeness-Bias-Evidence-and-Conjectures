To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or anecdotal evidence. The correct approach is to look at the base rates provided in the problem description.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors. Without any other differentiating information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
