Based on the limited information provided about Jason, it is difficult to determine with high confidence whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indication of his field of study or research interests.

However, given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional relevant information to differentiate Jason from the overall sample, the probability estimate should be close to this base rate.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
