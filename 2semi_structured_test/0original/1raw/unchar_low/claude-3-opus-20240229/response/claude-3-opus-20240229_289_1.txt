To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in the humanities.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
