To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors were interviewed
- 75 humanities professors were interviewed
- In total, 100 professors were interviewed

The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description focuses on general traits like ability, motivation, and collegiality, which could apply to successful professors in many fields.

In the absence of specific evidence pointing to computer science, we should defer to the base rate.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
