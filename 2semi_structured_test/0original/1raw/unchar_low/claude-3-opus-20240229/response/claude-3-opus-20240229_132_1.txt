To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the base rates and focus on the specific description. The description of Jason does not provide any information that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, so the base rates determine the probability.
