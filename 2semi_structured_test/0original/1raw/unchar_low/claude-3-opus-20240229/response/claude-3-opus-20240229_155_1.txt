Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field, only that he is well-regarded in his professional environment.

Given that the original sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess based only on the prior probabilities, there would be a 25% chance that a randomly selected professor from the group is in computer science.

However, since I don't have enough information to deviate from this prior probability, I will stick with 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
