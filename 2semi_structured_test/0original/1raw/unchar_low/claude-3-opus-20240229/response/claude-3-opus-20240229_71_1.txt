Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor with high confidence. The description does not mention Jason's specific field or provide clear distinguishing characteristics between computer science and humanities professors.

Without more relevant data about the distribution of traits among the two groups of professors, the best estimate would be the base rate probability. Since the sample includes 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the base rate is 25%.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
