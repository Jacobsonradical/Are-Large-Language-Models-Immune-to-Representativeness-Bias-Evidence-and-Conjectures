To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions, and instead base the estimate on the statistical information provided about the sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- No information is given in the description that clearly identifies Jason as being from one field or the other.

Therefore, based solely on the sample composition and without additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual (Jason) is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors, so the probability of selecting one at random is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.
