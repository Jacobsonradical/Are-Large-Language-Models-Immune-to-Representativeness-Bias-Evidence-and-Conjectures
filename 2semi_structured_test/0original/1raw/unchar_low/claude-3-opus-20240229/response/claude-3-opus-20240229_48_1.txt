To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the limited information provided and avoid making assumptions.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any specific information about his field of study.

Based on the available information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the study is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Since the description does not provide any additional information to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the overall sample, the probability remains 0.25.
