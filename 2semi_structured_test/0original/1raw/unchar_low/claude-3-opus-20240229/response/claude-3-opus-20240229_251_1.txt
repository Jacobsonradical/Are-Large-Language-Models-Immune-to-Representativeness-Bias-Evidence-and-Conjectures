To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates given in the problem description. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we should assign the probability based on the base rates alone.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 25/100 = 0.25.
