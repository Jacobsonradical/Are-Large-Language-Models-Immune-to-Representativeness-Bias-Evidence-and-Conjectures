To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science
- 75 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned - high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation - could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of additional field-specific information, the base rate is the best probability estimate.
