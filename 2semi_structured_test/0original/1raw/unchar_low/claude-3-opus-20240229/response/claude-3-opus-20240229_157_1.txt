To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the provided information and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes.

The description does not contain any information specific to computer science or the humanities. It only provides general positive traits that could apply to successful professors in any field, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
