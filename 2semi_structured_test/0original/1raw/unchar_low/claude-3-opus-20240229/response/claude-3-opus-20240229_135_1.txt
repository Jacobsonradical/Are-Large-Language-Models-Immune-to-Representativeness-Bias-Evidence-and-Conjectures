To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rate or prior probability. In this study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of any distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.25 or 25%.
