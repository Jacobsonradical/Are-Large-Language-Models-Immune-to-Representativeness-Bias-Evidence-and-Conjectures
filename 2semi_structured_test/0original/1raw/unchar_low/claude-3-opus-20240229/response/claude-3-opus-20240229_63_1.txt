To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that a randomly selected description belongs to a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25, or 25%.

The description itself does not provide any specific information that would make us update this probability. It does not mention any traits or characteristics that are distinctively associated with either computer science or humanities professors.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.25"}
