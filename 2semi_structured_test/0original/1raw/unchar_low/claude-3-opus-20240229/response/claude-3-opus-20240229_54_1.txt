To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information:

- There are a total of 100 professors in the sample.
- 25 of them are computer science professors.
- 75 of them are humanities professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, and positive reputation) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
