To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of additional field-specific information, the best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 0.25.
