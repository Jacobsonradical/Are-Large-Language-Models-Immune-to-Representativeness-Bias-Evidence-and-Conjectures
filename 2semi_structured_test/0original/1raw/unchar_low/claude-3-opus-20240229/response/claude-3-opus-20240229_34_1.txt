To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the problem.

Given:
- The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- No information about Jason's field of study is provided in the description.

Without any specific information about Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.

{"probability": "0.25"}
