Given the limited information provided about Jason, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field or research interests.

However, since the sample contains 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors, if I had to guess, I would say there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, simply based on the composition of the sample.

So my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This reflects the base rate of 1 in 4 professors in the sample being in computer science. But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate given the extremely limited information to distinguish Jason's likely field.
