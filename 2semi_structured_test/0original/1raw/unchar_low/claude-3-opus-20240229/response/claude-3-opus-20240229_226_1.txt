To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative sizes of the two groups in the sample.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the information given, is 0.25 or 25%.
