To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 professors total

The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is therefore 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to update this prior probability. While it describes Jason positively, there's no reason to believe the traits mentioned are more indicative of computer science professors than humanities professors. The description is quite general and could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of any diagnostic information to differentiate the two fields, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains at the base rate of 0.25.
