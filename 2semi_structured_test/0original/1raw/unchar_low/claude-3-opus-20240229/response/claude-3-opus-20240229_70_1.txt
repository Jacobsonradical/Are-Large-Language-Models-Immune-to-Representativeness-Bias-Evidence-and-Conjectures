To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason was chosen at random from these 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is:
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate.
