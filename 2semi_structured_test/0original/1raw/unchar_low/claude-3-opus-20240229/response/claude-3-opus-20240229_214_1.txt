To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional distinguishing information in Jason's description, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 25 / 100
            = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
