To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study setup.

The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(computer science professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of any specific evidence favoring one field over the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain at the base rate.
