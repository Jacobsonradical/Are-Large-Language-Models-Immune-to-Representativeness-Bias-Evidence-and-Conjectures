To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

In the study, there were:
- 25 computer science professors 
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

Without any other distinguishing information, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. His traits of being highly able, motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.25.
