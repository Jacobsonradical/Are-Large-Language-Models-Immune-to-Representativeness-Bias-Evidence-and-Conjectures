Based on the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indications of his field of study.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if I had to guess Jason's field based only on the prior probabilities, I would estimate a 25% chance that he is a computer science professor.

However, I want to emphasize that there is significant uncertainty in this estimate since the description does not provide specific clues about Jason's academic discipline. More information would be needed to make a confident assessment.
