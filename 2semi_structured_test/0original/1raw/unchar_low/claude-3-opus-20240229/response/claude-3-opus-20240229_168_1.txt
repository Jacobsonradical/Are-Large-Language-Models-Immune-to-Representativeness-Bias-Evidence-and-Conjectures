Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected individual from this group being a computer science professor is 25%. Without additional distinguishing information, this prior probability is a reasonable estimate.
