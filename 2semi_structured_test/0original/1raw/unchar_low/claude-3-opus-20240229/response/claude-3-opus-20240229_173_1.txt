To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the prior probability (base rate) of computer science professors in the sample, and see if the description provides any additional distinguishing information to update this probability.

Given information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason provides some information about his personality traits, but these traits seem quite general and could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities. The description doesn't give any strong indication that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best estimated by the prior probability in the sample.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
