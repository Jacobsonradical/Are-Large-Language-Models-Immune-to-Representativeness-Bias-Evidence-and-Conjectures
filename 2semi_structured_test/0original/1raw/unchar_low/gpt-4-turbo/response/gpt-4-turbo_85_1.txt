Considering the information provided and the total number of successful professors in each area (25 in computer science and 75 in humanities), the probability that any randomly chosen description, including Jason's, is from a computer science professor can be calculated based on basic probability principles. Since there is no specific information in the description clearly associating Jason with either group, the following assumption is made purely on the distribution of the sample:

- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

The probability must be proportionate to the distribution of the professors in the sample. Given this uniform distribution and lack of additional distinguishing information about the domain of profession:

Probability (Jason is a computer science professor) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
                                                    = 25 / 100
                                                    = 0.25

Therefore, the JSON response formatted answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
