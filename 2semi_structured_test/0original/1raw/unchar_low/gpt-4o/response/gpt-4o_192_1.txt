Given the information and the numbers in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science (CS) professors.
- There are 75 humanities (H) professors.
- Total descriptions = 100.

If we assume that Jason's description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor:

- P(CS) = Probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25.
- P(H) = Probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75.

Since we are given no additional information that could differentiate between the types of professors beyond what describes Jason’s personality in ways that are equally likely to be found in both fields (high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked), we assume equal likelihood:

By Bayes' Theorem,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the observed description D given it’s a computer science professor,
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description D across all professors.

Since \( P(D|
