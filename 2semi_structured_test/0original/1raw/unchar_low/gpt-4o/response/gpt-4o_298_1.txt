Sure. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities (before considering the description) for each group are:

- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(Hum)): 75/100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that would strongly differentiate between the two groups. Assuming the description applies equally well to both groups, the probability remains influenced by the prior proportions. Given no additional differential information, the best estimate is based on the initial distribution.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is proportionate to the initial likelihoods:

{"probability": "0.25"}
