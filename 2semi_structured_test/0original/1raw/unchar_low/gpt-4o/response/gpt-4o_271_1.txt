To approach this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates current evidence to prior probability. Here's the breakdown:

- We are given a description of one professor, Jason.
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Since the description of Jason does not contain information specific to computer science or humanities disciplines, we must rely on base rates (the initial numbers of professors in each field).

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated based on the proportion of the total professors that are in computer science.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors is \( P(Hum) \):

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description doesn't provide any distinguishing individual characteristics that would skew the likelihood towards computer science or humanities beyond the base rates, we have:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
