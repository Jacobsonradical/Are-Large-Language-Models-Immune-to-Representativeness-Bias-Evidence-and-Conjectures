To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \( B \) be the event that we have Jason's description.

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( |CS| \)) is 25.
- The number of humanities professors (\( |H| \)) is 75.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Since the description doesn't provide any specific details that differentiate between the two fields:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|H) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

If we assume that the descriptions were written in a way that they don't favor one field over the other, then \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \) can be considered equally likely.

Given this, the probabilities of selecting a computer science or humanities professor are based on their proportions:
\[
P
