Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability (prior probability) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided doesn't include any information that helps distinguish between traits of computer science or humanities professors specifically. It mentions high ability, strong motivation, and a positive reputation, which are likely common traits among both groups chosen as successful academics.

Given the lack of distinguishing details, we rely on the base rates. Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the prior probability.

So, the probability is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.25" \]
