Based on the information provided, we have a sample of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. We are given a random description of a professor with certain personal and professional attributes, but none of these attributes specifically point towards computer science or humanities.

Since the description does not include any definitive clues towards either field, we need to use the base rates provided in the sample.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) can be calculated using the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100.

Thus, the probability is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
