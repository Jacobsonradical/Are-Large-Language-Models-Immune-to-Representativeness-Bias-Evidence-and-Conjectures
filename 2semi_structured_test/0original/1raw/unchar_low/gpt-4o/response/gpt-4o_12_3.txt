To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The base rates (prior probabilities) are important here:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100. 

From these numbers, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional specific information distinguishing Jason's description as more likely for one group over the other, the description provided ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation") doesn't explicitly favor either group. If we assume that this description is equally probable for both groups, then we can use just the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
