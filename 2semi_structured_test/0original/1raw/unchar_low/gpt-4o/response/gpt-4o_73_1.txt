Given the information provided, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, we note the base rates from the sample. We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total = 100 professors

To use Bayes' theorem, let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Description \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We are asked for \( P(CS|D) \).

We start with the base rates:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we assess the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given Jason is in humanities.

Given that the description is relatively neutral and doesnâ€™t clearly favor either group, we might assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H)
