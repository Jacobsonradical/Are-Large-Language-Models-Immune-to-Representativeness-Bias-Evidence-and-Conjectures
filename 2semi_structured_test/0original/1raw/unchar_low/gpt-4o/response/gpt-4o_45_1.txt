To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let’s list the given data:

- Total professors = 100
- Computer science professors (CS) = 25
- Humanities professors (H) = 75

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event described in the text (Jason's profile).

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is in computer science:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is in the humanities:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A) and P(B|H))**:
   Since we don't have specific likelihood values, we'll assume that the likelihood of Jason’s description fitting a professor is generally similar in both groups. Given
