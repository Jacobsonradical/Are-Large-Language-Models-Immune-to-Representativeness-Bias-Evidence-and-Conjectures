To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our knowledge based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS | D) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description.

We know that \( P(CS) \) is the proportion of computer science professors, and \( P(H) \) is the proportion of humanities professors. Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Therefore:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Because we do not have any specific evidence to suggest that the description is more or less likely for either group, we assume:
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]
