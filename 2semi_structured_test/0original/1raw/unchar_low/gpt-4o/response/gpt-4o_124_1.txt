To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the number of professors in each group and any specific details about Jason that might influence the probability. 

Given:
- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science
- 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities
- Total number of professors = 100

From the description provided, there are no specific details that clearly favor one group over the other (both groups are composed of highly able, strongly motivated, well-liked, and reputable individuals).

Given this, we can use the base rate to estimate the probability:
- The prior probability of someone being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25
- The prior probability of someone being a humanities professor is 75/100 = 0.75

Using these base rates, since there is no additional information that discriminates between the two groups, we can calculate the probability directly as:

{"probability": "0.25"}
