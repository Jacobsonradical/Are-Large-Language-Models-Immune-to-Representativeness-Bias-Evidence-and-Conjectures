Sure, let's analyze the given information.

You have:
- 25 successful computer science professors
- 75 successful humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

Given that the description of Jason does not directly correlate with specific traits unique to either field (computer science or humanities), we rely on the base rates.

The base rate probability is calculated based on the initial known distribution:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor: 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor: 75/100 = 0.75

Given no additional discriminating information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains at the base rate level.

Thus, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
