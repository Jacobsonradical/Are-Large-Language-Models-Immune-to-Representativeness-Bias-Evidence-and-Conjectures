Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. We can approach this using Bayes' theorem, but since we have limited specific information about Jason that would distinguish him between the two fields, we will make a probability estimate based on the proportions of the samples.

The initial breakdown is:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

This gives us a prior probability:
- Probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since the description of Jason doesn't give definitive indicators that would skew towards one group or the other, we should rely on these base rates.

Hence, the probability estimate that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
