First, let's note the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.

The probability of choosing a description of a professor from the computer science sample, without considering additional information, is:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, considering the given description of Jason:
- Jason is a 30-year-old man.
- Married and without children.
- High ability and strong motivation.
- Well-liked by his colleagues.
- Positive professional reputation.

There is no specific information that strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be from either computer science or the humanities. Both fields can have individuals with such traits.

Given that the description does not preferentially indicate membership in either group, we should rely on the base rates (prior probabilities) provided by the relative sample sizes.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, my answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
