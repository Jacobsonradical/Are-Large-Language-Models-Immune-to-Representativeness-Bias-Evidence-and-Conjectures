Given the information provided, the probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = Jason has the described personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given that he has the described traits.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without additional information to distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors based solely on the description, we assume that the described traits (B) are equally likely among both groups.

Thus:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of being a computer science professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of having the described traits given that one is a computer science professor, is not explicitly given but assumed to be the same as \( P(B| \neg A) \), the probability of having the described traits given that one is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \), the overall probability of having the described traits, includes contributions from both groups.

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B| \
