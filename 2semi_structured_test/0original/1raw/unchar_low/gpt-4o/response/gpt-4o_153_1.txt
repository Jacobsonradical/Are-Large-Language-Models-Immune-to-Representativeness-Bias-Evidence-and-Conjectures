Given the information about Jason, one can estimate the probability that he is a computer science professor by applying Bayes' theorem. We need to consider:

1. The base rates of the two groups: 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
2. The likelihood of the description matching computer science versus humanities professors.

Since the description doesn't provide specific information that could highly differentiate between the two groups, we mainly rely on the base rates.

Let's calculate the base rate probability:

- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Without additional distinctive information, we assume that the likelihood of the description fitting either group is the same. Therefore, the posterior probability (P(CS | Description)) is proportional to the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
