To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which leverages the given proportions in the sample and our description of Jason.

First, we need the following information:
- The total number of professors in the study: 25 (computer science) + 75 (humanities) = 100.
- The proportions:
  - \( P(CS) \) = Probability of selecting a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25.
  - \( P(H) \) = Probability of selecting a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75.

Now, because we have no reason to believe that personality traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are more frequent in one group over the other (based on the given information), we assume that the likelihood \( P(Description | CS) \) = \( P(Description | H) \) = 1.

With this, we proceed as follows:
- \( P(CS | Description) \) = \( \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \).

Given that:
- \( P(Description) \) is the same for both groups, it simplifies to the normalized priors.

This gives us:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25. \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.
