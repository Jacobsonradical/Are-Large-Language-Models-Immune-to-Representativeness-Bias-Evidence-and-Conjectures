Given that the description of Jason does not strongly differentiate between computer science professors and humanities professors, we can base our probability estimate on the given proportions of professors in each group. 

We know:
- 25 out of the 100 descriptions are for computer science professors.
- 75 out of the 100 descriptions are for humanities professors.

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
