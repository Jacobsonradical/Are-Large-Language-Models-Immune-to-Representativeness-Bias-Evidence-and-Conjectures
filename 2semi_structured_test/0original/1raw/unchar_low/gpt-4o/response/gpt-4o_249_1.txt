To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to consider the base rates of the two groups of professors in the sample. The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The base rate probability of selecting a computer science professor at random from this sample can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the base rate probability of selecting a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided for Jason does not give any specific information about his field, only general personality and demographic details. Without additional information, we should use the base rates as our guide.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
