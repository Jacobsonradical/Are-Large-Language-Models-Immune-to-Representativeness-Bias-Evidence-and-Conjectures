To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem and consider the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

The proportion of computer science professors is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
The proportion of humanities professors is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming no additional distinguishing information from the description provided (that is, the description does not favor one group over the other), we will consider these proportions as our probabilities.

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since the description does not give us any information that favors one group over the other, we will assume that \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})\). Thus, the comparison reduces to the ratio of the prior probabilities:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason
