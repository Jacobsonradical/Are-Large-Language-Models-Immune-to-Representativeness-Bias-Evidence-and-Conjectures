To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes’ Theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description. Bayes’ Theorem, in its simplest form for this problem, is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where: 
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description appearing.

In this case:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly, which is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly, which is \( 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Since the description provided does not favor one group over the other, we will assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), meaning the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor is the same as the likelihood given a humanities professor. Therefore:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)
