Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, we start with the initial probabilities (prior probabilities) of Jason being in each group:

- Probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, examining Jason's description, there are no specific details indicating a higher likelihood of him being in either group beyond the baseline probabilities, as the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, being well-liked) are common in both groups given their success in academia.

Therefore, without additional evidence to suggest a stronger or weaker association with either group, the probabilities remain as the initial probabilities.

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:
