The information provided about Jason does not give specific details that differentiate between a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we will have to rely on the given sample sizes. 

We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study. So, the probability that a randomly chosen professor (Jason) is from the computer science group can be calculated using the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Here is the probability:

{"probability": "0.25"}
