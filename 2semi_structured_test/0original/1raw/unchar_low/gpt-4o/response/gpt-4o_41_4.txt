The problem involves applying Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the information provided in his description. Bayes' theorem can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason having his personality description.

However, since we do not have concrete probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \), we can use the proportions of the total sample for a simpler approach.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( A^c \) as Jason being a humanities professor.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} =
