{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is calculated based on the base rates of the two groups in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor 25/100, or 0.25. Since the description does not provide specific traits that are unique to either group, we rely on the base rate for this calculation.
