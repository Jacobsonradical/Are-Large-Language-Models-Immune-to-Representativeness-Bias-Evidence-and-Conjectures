To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the professors in each discipline:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Given that the description of Jason is chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, we donâ€™t have any discipline-specific information other than the fact that there are more humanities professors (75) compared to computer science professors (25).

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be approximated by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
