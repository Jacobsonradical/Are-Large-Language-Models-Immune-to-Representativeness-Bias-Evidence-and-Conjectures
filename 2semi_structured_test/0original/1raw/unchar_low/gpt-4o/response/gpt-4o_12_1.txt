Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Since we don't have any specific information that differentiates the personality descriptions of computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume that the probability of any description fitting either group is the same. Thus, \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \).

Given this assumption:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = P
