To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We don't have any specific information about how likely a description like Jason's is among the computer science versus humanities professors. In the absence of such information, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since we assume that the description is equally likely to appear among professors in both fields, the term \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{hum}) \) are equal and cancel out in the calculation.

So, the posterior probability simplifies to the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\
