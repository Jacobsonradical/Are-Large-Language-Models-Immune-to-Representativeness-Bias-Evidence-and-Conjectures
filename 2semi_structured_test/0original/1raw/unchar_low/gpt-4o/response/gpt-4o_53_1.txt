Given the numbers of professors in each field, we have:

- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

In total, there are 100 professors.

To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we assume that each professor is equally likely to be chosen. Hence, we apply the principle of uniform probability.

The probability \( P \) is given by the ratio of the number of professors in computer science to the total number of professors:

\[ P = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.25"}
