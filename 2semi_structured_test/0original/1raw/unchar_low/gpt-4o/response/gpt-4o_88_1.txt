To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since the description provided does not include any specific information that distinctly differentiates the computer science professors from the humanities professors, we will primarily rely on the proportion of professors in each category.

Out of the 100 professors:
- 25 are computer science professors.
- 75 are humanities professors.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description of Jason does not give us any further distinguishing information that would affect this prior probability, we can directly use this figure as our answer.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{
  "probability": "0.25"
}
