To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

The relevant numbers are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total of 100 professors

Given that there is no specific information that differentiates between the personality traits of computer science and humanities professors based on Jason's description, we can assume that the description equally likely applies to professors in both groups.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \) is calculated as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jasonâ€™s description occurring.

Since the description is assumed to be equally likely for both groups, \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The overall probability \( P
