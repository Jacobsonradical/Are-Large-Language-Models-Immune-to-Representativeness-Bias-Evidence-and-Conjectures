To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which in this case boils down to considering the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the given sample.

There are a total of 100 professors in the study, of which:
- 25 are computer science professors
- 75 are humanities professors

We are asked to randomly choose one of the 100 professors, then find the probability that this professor, Jason, is a computer science professor.

Given that we have no prior reason to assume that personality traits related to "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are differentially distributed between these two groups, we treat them as equally likely across both groups. This means we simply consider the proportion of each group in the overall sample.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
