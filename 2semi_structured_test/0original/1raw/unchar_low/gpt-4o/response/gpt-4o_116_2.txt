To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider both the base rates and how well Jason's description matches each group. Given no specific distinguishing characteristics between the groups, we'll primarily use the base rates here.

There were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the total 100 professors.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming descriptions of professors are equally likely to match either group based on the information given (Jason's traits of high ability, strong motivation, and likability are common to both groups), the probabilities remain proportional to their base rates.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS) \cdot P(\text{description} | CS)}{P(CS) \cdot P(\text{description} | CS) + P(Hum) \cdot P(\text{description} | Hum)} \]

Given \( P(\text{description} | CS) \approx P
