Given the setup of the problem, the total number of professors is 100: 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities. Since Jason is chosen at random from these 100 professors, we start with these probabilities:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

The description provided about Jason does not give any specific information related to his field that would update these probabilities in a Bayesian sense. Therefore, we rely on the initial proportions given in the problem.

Thus, the probability remains:

{"probability": "0.25"}
