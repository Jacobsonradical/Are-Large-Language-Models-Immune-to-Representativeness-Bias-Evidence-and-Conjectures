To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. The total number of professors in the study is the sum of computer science professors and humanities professors:

- Number of computer science (CS) professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Since Jason was chosen at random from these 100 professors, without any additional specific information linking his personality traits to a particular field, we can assume that each professor has an equal chance of being chosen. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated as the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:
