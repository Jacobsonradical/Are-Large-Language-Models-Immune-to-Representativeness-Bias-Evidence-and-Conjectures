To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to consider the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample, as well as any relevant information from the description about Jason that might skew these base rates.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

Assuming no significant bias in Jason's description favoring either field, the base rate approach would be used. This means we compare the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors to determine our probability:

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Here's the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
