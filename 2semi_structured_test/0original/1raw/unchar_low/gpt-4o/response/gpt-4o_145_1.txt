To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's apply Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's outline the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

The description given is quite general and does not give any explicit bias towards either group. So, for the sake of simplifying and if we assume that the description of being high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and having a positive professional reputation is equally likely for both computer science professors and humanities professors, we set:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

However, without more detailed statistics that separate specific traits between computer science and humanities professors, we have to use the prior probabilities directly.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS
