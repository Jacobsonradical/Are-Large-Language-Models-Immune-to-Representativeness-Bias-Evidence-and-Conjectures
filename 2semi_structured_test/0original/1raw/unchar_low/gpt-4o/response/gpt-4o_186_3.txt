To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the initial probability, or prior probability, that Jason is a computer science professor (let's call this \( P(CS) \)) is based on their proportion in the sample. Jason could either be one of the 25 computer science professors or one of the 75 humanities professors. Thus, \( P(CS) \) is given by:

\[P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (let's call this \( P(H) \)) is:

\[P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

Since the description given (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, 30-year-old, married without children) does not inherently favor either group based on the information provided, we assume the likelihood of the description being applicable within each group is the same. Therefore, the posterior probability will be equivalent to the prior probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample
