Let's break this down using some basic probability principles.

First, we know the sample distribution:
- 25 tenured and successful professors are from computer science.
- 75 tenured and successful professors are from the humanities.

This gives us a total of 100 professors. So, the prior probabilities are:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

Given the description of Jason, we need to assess whether this description is more or equally likely to match a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Although specific personality traits and social cues (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are described, these traits are common among successful academics and not explicitly indicative of either field.

Since the description does not provide any clear bias toward either field, we rely on the prior probabilities calculated above:

{"probability": "0.25"}
