Based on the description provided and the information about the sample size of the study, we can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We are given:
- The total sample size is 100 professors.
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given that he fits the description.

Step-by-step approach:
1. Determine the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor from the population:
   P(CS) = number of CS professors / total professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25

2. Determine the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor from the population:
   P(H) = number of Humanities professors / total professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75

3. Since we do not have specific information about how the description correlates with the specific field, we need to assume the description applies equally to both groups.

By applying Bayes' Theorem, and if we assume that the description applies equally to both groups, the posterior probability should match the prior probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given no additional specific information, will be equal to the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.

Hence, the probability can be given as:
