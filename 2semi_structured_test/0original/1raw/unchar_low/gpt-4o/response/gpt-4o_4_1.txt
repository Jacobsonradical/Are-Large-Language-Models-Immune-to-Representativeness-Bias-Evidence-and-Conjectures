To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we break it down:

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate the conditional probability \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need to establish the priors:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we would ideally need the exact \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given that Jason's description doesnâ€™t strongly
