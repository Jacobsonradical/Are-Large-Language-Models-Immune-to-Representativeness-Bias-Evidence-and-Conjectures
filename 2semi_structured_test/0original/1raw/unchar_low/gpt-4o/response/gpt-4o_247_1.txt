The probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem, incorporating the given information.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before knowing any additional details is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(\text{H}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description provides no specific details distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors. If we assume the description is equally likely for both groups, then the likelihoods are the same:
   \[
   P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{description}|\text{H})
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
