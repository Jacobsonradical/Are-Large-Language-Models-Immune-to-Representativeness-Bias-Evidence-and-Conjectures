Given the setup of the study, we have a total of 100 professorsâ€”25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities.

We know that Jason is described as 30 years old, married without children, highly able, highly motivated, and well-liked by his colleagues. However, the description provided does not give specific information that would help distinctly categorize him as either a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use the base rates provided:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

The total number of professors is 100.

Using these base rates, the probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, without additional specific information that could differentiate between the two groups, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
