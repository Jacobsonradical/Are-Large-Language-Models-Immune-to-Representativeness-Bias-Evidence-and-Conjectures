Given the information you provided, we know the distribution of professors between the two groups: 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means:

- The probability of randomly picking a computer science professor from the sample is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of randomly picking a humanities professor from the sample is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description of Jason does not offer specific contextual or detailed information to clearly differentiate between a professor in computer science and one in the humanities.

To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'd ideally want to use Bayes' theorem incorporating additional distinguishing features. However, given the lack of distinctive information in this description, the prior probabilities based on group sizes should be maintained.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample remains at:

{"probability": "0.25"}
