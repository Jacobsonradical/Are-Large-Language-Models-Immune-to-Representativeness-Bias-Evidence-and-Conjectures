Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probabilities initially suggest that there is a 1 in 4 chance (or 0.25) that Jason is one of the computer science professors, as the sample sizes alone imply these probabilities. However, personality traits and descriptions were usually distributed without specific emphasis on department distinctions. Therefore, the description doesn't provide additional significant distinguishing information.

Based on this, and adhering strictly to the given probabilities without additional layers of bias or information about departmental traits, the probability remains aligned with prior probabilities. Thus, the chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains at 0.25.

Here is the probabilistic response:
