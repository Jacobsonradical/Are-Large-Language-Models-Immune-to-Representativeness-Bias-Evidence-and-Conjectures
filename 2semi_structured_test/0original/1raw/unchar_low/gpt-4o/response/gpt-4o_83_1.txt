To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we should use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description fitting a professor from either group.

### Given Data:
1. Total professors in the study: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
2. Personality description fitting specified criteria.

### Steps:
1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**
   Assuming that high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are equally likely in both groups (which might often be the case in a well-designed study), the likelihood of the description being that of either a computer science or a humanities professor can be considered equal.

3. **Posterior Probability**
   Using Bayes' theorem, if we assume the description is equally likely in both groups, we don't need to adjust the prior probability:
   
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS
