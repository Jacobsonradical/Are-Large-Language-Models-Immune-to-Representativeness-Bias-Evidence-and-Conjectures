To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor

Given:
- Total professors = 100
- Computer science professors (\( P(CS) \)) = 25
- Humanities professors (\( P(H) \)) = 75

Prior probabilities:
$$ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 $$
$$ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 $$

Since we don't have specific information on the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we will assume for simplicity that the description is equally likely among both groups. This means:
$$ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) $$

Bayes' Theorem:
$$ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} $$

Since \( P(D) \) is the same
