Given the details of the study, we can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Base rate information:**
    - There are 25 computer science professors.
    - There are 75 humanities professors.
    - Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the pool is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
    - Similarly, the probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Description Analysis:**
    - The description provided does not give any specific information that directly discriminates between computer science and humanities professors. It mentions general traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, which are likely to be common among the successful professors in both fields in the study.

3. **Updated probability:**
    - Since the description is generic and doesn't provide information skewing towards one group over the other, we maintain the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

So the answer is as follows:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
