Given that there are 25 professors in computer science and 75 in the humanities, the probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is calculated using the principle of base rates. Letâ€™s denote:

P(CS) as the probability of covering a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

P(Hum) as the probability of covering a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since no specific, distinguishing details in the description uniquely point towards computer science over humanities, the base rate remains our best estimate. Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains 0.25.

Therefore, the probability Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
