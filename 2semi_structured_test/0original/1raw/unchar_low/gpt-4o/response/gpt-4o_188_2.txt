To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to find \( P(C \mid E) \), where \( E \) is the evidence provided by Jason's description.

Given:
- \( P(C) \) = Prior probability that a professor is from computer science = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that a professor is from humanities = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75

Assuming the evidence \( E \) (Jason's description) is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors (since no distinguishing traits specific to either field are given in the description), we have:
- \( P(E \mid C) \) = Probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer scientist = 1
- \( P(E \mid H) \) = Probability of the evidence given that Jason is a humanities professor = 1

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \)
