Given the information provided, the main factors to consider are the distribution of the professors in the sample and the details of Jason's description.

There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. Since Jason was chosen at random from these 100 professors, the base rate probability that Jason is from a particular group is dependent on the size of that group.

The probability can be calculated as follows:

P(Computer Science | Random Selection) = (Number of Computer Science Professors) / (Total Number of Professors)
P(Computer Science | Random Selection) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Therefore, without additional specific information differentiating computer science professors from humanities professors in the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}
