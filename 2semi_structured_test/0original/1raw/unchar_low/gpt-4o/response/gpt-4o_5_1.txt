Given the information provided and the setup of the problem, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. We need to consider both the base rate of computer science professors in the sample and the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

1. Base rate (prior probability):
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. Likelihood of the description given the department (which we assume is equal for both groups as there's no distinguishing trait provided):
Without additional specific traits that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we assume the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor is the same as fitting a humanities professor.

Given no other distinguishing information, we rely on the base rates. Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
