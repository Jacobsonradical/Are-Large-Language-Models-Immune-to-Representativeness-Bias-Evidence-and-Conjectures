To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total professors = 25 + 75 = 100.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description does not provide any specific details that differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors. Both groups are equally likely to have such traits.

3. **Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem)**:
   - If there is no additional distinguishing information provided by the description that favors one group over the other, then the posterior probability remains equal to the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
