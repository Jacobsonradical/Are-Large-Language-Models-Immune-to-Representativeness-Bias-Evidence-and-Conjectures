To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample, we need to consider the base rates of the groups involved. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, comprising a total of 100 professors. 

This implies that there is a 25% a priori probability that any randomly chosen professor from this group is a computer science professor.

The information provided about Jason doesn't seem to favor one group over the other â€” thus, we can rely on the base rate information directly.

So, given that there's no additional information to sway us towards one group more than the other, the probability remains the base rate of 25%:
