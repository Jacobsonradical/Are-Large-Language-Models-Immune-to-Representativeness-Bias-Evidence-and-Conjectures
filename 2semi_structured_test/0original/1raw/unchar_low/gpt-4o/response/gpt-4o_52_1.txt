Given the information:

- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Without additional information to distinguish between the two groups, we use the base rates provided:

- Probability of picking a computer science professor randomly, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Probability of picking a humanities professor randomly, \( P(Hum) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description provided does not contain specific details that would reliably indicate whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given that, the best estimate aligns with the base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
