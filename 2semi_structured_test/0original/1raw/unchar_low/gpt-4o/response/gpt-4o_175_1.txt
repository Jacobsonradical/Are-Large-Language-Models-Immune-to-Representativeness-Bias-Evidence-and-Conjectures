Let's assess this using Bayesian reasoning. First, we can represent the number of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

The description of Jason ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation") is fairly general and could likely apply to both computer science and humanities professors. Consequently, in the absence of further distinguishing information, we might consider the likelihood of such a description to be similar for both groups.

If this description is equally likely for both groups, the likelihoods would be:

- Probability of this description given computer science professor (\(P(Descr|CS)\)): will be treated as equal to
- Probability of this description given humanities professor (\(P(Descr|Hum)\)): 1 (as we believe it does not differ significantly between groups).

Bayes' theorem is then:
\[ P(CS|Descr) = \frac{P(Descr|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Descr)}
