To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we want to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description for any professor in the study.

Given that we do not have specific details about the descriptions, we will assume that the descriptions are evenly likely to occur among both groups. This simplifies our calculation:

1. \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
2. \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
3. \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) are considered equally
