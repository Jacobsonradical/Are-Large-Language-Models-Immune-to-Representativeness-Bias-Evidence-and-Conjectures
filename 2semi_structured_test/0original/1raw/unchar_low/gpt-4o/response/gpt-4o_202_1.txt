To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. However, given that the description does not provide specific information unique to computer science or humanities professors, we can use the base rates of the two groups in the sample.

The base rate for computer science professors is 25 out of 100, and for humanities professors is 75 out of 100.

\[
P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
