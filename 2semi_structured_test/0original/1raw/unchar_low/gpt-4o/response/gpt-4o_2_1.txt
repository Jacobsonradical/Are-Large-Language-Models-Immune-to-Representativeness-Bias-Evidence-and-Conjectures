To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning. 

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a random professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

We're looking for \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The base rates are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional information besides Jason's description, we assume that \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equally likely for both groups since the description does not specify particular traits strongly associated with either computer science or humanities. Thus:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{
