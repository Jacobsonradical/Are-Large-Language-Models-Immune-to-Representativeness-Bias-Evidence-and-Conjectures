Given the information in the problem, we know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the total number of professors 100.

The description provided does not give any information specific to either field of study, so we can assume that the likelihood of Jason being from either category is proportional to the number of professors in that category.

The probability can be calculated as the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
