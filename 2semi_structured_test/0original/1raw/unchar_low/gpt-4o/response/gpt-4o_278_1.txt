To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The sample consists of:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- 100 total professors

Since the descriptions were chosen at random, and assuming no additional information contributes to distinguishing between the groups more than what we've already known, the probability is based directly on the ratio of computer science professors to the total professors.

Using basic probability principles, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
