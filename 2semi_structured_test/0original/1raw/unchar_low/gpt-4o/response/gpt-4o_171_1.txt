To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample, we need to consider both the number of computer science professors and the number of professors from the humanities in the sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus, the total number of professors is \(25 + 75 = 100\).

Since Jasonâ€™s description does not provide specific details that differentiate between the two groups, we should base our probability on the proportion of each group in the total sample.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is calculated by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
