Given the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated based on the proportion of each group in the sample.

There are a total of 100 professors:
- 25 are in computer science
- 75 are in the humanities

The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:

P(CS) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors
       = 25 / 100
       = 0.25

Taking into account only Jason's description without any additional specific details directly linking him more to computer science or humanities, we can use these initial proportions.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
