To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll begin by considering the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which sums to 100 professors in total.

So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description of Jason, which highlights traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and a positive reputation, we must now consider whether these characteristics are more or less likely to appear among computer science professors or humanities professors. However, without specific data on how these traits are distributed among the two groups, we assume the traits are equally likely to occur in both groups.

Thus, we base our answer on the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{\ "probability": "0.25" }
