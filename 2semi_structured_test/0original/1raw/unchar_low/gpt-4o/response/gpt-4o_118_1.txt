Given the information provided, we know that no specific personality traits or behaviors that clearly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors are provided in Jason's description. Since Jason is randomly chosen from the total sample:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The probability \( P(\text{CS professor}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
