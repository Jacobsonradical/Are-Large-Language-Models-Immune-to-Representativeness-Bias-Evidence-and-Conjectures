Given that Jason is one of the randomly chosen 100 professors from the descriptions offered, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that he is a computer science professor.

First, let's denote our events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description, we need to estimate the probability \( P(D|C) \) that Jason fits the described traits among computer science professors, and \( P(D|H) \) that he fits the described traits among humanities professors.

Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups without additional specific details indicating otherwise, we can take \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \). Given this, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \), and assuming \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \),

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\
