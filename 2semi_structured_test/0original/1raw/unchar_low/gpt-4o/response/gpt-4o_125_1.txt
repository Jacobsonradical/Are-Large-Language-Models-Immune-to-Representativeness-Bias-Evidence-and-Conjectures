Given the information provided, it is important to take into account the base rates of the two groups of professors in the sample. Specifically, 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science and 75 out of 100 are from the humanities. 

Using this base rate information, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) \) (Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(B) \) (Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

The description of Jason does not provide sufficient details to strongly favor either group, therefore we should primarily rely on these base rates.

Based on these considerations, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
