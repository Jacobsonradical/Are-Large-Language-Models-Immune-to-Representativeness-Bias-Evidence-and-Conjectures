Based on the provided information, let's calculate the probability.

We know that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that distinguishes between the two groups, so we must rely on the base rates alone.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description can be calculated using the base rates:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Since the description does not give any distinguishing information, we assume it is equally likely for any professor to fit the description. Therefore, our probability remains based on the base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.25\).

Here is the formatted response:

{"probability": "0.25"}
