Given the information provided, the essential details to consider are:

- Out of the total 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in the humanities.
- Characteristics described about Jason: high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive professional reputation.

These traits are general and can be attributed to any successful academic, regardless of their specific field. Therefore, the description does not provide specific information that favors one group over the other. Consequently, we will base our probability calculation solely on the proportions of professors in each group.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
