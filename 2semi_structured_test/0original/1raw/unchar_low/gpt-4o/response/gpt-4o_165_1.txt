Based on the information provided, we know that there are two groups of professors: 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific details that would strongly differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. Thus, we can use the base rates of the two groups to make a probabilistic assessment.

Given the base rates:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Since no additional distinguishing information about Jason that favors one group over the other has been provided, we will rely on these base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}
