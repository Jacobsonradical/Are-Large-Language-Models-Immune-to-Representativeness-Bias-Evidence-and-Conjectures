Based on the information provided, I'd need to consider both base rates and any distinguishing characteristics mentioned in the description. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This implies a base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25 out of 100, or 0.25, and the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide specific traits that are strongly indicative of either field, such as specific research interests or skills that are predominantly found in one discipline over the other. In the absence of such information, we rely heavily on the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based primarily on the base rates, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
