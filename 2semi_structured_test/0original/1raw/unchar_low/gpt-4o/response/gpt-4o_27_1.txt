To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description being associated with either group of professors.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total: 100 professors

The probability of randomly choosing a computer science professor (prior probability):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability of randomly choosing a humanities professor (prior probability):
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We assume the description is equally likely to apply to members of both groups because there's no specific information indicating otherwise. Thus, the likelihood of the description given the person is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \)) and the likelihood of the description given the person is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \)) are the same.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Because \( P(\text{Description}) \) will be a normalization factor and the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability depends only on the prior probabilities.

Therefore:
\[ P(C
