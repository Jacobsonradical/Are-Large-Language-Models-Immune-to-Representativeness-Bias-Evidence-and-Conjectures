Given the information provided:
- There are 100 professors in total (25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities).
- We know Jason has traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked.

To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, because the description does not provide any indication that distinguishes computer science professors from those in the humanities based solely on the given traits.

The proportion of computer science professors among the total sample is:

25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
