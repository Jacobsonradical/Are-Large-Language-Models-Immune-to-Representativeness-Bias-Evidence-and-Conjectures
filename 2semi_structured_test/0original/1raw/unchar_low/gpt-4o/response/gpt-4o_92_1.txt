To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that he fits a randomly provided description of a professor, we can employ Bayes' theorem. However, we do not have specific data regarding how likely a professor from each field is to fit Jason's description. Therefore, we will use the base rates provided in the study to calculate the probability.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100 (25 + 75).

Assuming no other information biases the likelihood of a person fitting the description more towards one category than the other, we base our probability calculation purely on the numbers of professors in each field.

Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) \) is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, based on the base rates alone and without additional information distinguishing Jason's description more towards computer science than humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
