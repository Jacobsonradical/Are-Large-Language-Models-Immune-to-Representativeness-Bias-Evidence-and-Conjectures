To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's consider the information given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, there are a total of 100 professors.

Since a description is randomly chosen, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is the ratio of humanities professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given Jason's description (which remains quite general and does not indicate specific traits particularly associated with either field), we have no reason based on the description alone to favor either group. Hence, we use the prior probabilities directly.

So based on the provided information and without any specific reasoning pointing definitively towards either group beyond their base rates, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{probability} = 0.25 \]

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.25"}
