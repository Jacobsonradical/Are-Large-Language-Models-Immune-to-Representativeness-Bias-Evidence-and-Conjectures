Given the information provided, we should use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

Initially, we should consider the prior probabilities:
- Out of the 100 descriptions, 25 are of computer science professors and 75 are of humanities professors.
- So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) for humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

From the description of Jason, we are given no specific attributes or evidence that directly link him to either the computer science or humanities groups. The description is relatively general and does not seem to favor one field over the other.

Thus, if we assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both groups, the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) (where \( D \) denotes the description fitting) would be the same. Consequently, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \approx \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the number of professors
