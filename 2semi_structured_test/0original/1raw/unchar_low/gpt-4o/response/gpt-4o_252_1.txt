To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We are given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- 25 professors are from computer science.
- 75 professors are from the humanities.

We need to find the probability based on the given description. However, the description provided does not indicate a specific field that would differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors. Therefore, we can consider the base probability:

\[
P(A | B) = P(A) \times \frac{P(B | A)}{P(B)}
\]

In this scenario:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of observing Jason's description regardless of field.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Since the description does not favor one field over another, we assume \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A^c)\), the probability of observing the same description if he is a humanities professor, are approximately equal.

Given that the description does not provide differentiating information, \(P(B|A) \approx P(B)\), allowing us to simplify to the base probabilities.

Thus:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{25
