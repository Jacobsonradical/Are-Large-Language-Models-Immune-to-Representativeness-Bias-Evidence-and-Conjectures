Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and assuming that Jason's description does not inherently favor one group over the other based on profession, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor can be calculated using the base rates.

The base probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
