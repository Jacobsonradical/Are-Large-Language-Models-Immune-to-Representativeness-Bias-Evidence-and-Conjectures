To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

- Total number of professors: 100 (25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities)
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We also need to consider the likelihood of having a description like Jason's for both groups. However, since the description given does not provide specific details uniquely indicating one field over the other, we can assume the descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Therefore, the likelihood ratio is 1.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \), the denominator \( P(\text{Description}) \) is also evenly split by the number of professors in the two groups.

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \
