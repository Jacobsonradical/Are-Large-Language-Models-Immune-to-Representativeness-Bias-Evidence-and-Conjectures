To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
- We have no information indicating that Jason's individual characteristics are more likely in one group than the other beyond the fact that he is a tenured and successful professor.

We'll start with the base rate probability:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given that we don't have additional distinguishing information about Jason that correlates specifically with either discipline, we assume each description is randomly selected and equally likely from either group.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains equal to the base rate:

{"probability": "0.25"}
