To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem and consider the base rates of the two groups of professors.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Since the description given doesn't provide any specific traits heavily weighted toward one discipline, we'll rely on the base rate to determine the probability.

The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we have no specific evidence that distinguishes Jason's field beyond the given description, we assume these priors are representative. Hence, based on the base rates alone:

\[ P(Jason \text{ is a CS professor}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:
