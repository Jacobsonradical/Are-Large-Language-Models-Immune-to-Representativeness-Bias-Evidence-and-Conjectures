Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the total sample of 100 professors, the base rate (prior probability) for each group is as follows:

- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Without other distinguishing information about Jason that points specifically toward computer science or humanities, we need to rely on these base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
