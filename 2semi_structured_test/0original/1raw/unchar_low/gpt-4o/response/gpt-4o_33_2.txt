Given the provided description of Jason and an equal level of high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a professor in the humanities. 

The study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so we have a total of 100 professors, with 1 out of every 4 (or 25%) being from computer science and 3 out of every 4 (or 75%) being from the humanities.

We need to determine the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group. Since there are no specific traits mentioned that would make him more or less likely to belong to either group, we can use the prior proportional likelihoods:

- Probability he is from computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability he is from humanities (\( P(\text{H}) \)) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Because we are given no additional information to differentiate Jason as being significantly more likely to belong to one group over the other, we can use these base probabilities directly. Hence,

Based on this and the description provided,

{"probability": "0.25"}
