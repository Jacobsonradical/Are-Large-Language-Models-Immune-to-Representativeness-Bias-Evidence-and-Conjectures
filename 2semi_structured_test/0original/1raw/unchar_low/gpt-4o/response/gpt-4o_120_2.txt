Given the information, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. With no additional distinguishing information that could indicate a higher likelihood of Jason belonging to one group over the other, the probability would be based solely on the proportion of each group in the total sample.

To find this probability, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
