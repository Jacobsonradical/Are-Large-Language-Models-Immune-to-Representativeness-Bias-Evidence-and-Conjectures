Given the description of Jason and knowing the distribution of the professors in the study (25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) be the event that Jason is described as having high ability and strong motivation, and is well-liked by colleagues.

We want \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. We do not have specific details to differentiate the likelihood of having such traits between CS and humanities professors, so we assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting a description
