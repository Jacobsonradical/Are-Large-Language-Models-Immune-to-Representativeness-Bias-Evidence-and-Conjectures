Given the sample sizes and the provided description, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and any distinguishing characteristics from the description.

First, let's establish the prior probability. Initially, the probabilities based on the sample sizes are:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

The description provided for Jason does not contain specific information that heavily leans towards either discipline. It describes general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) which could be considered common among successful academics in both fields.

Without specific evidence favoring one field over the other, we default to the prior probabilities.

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains:
{"probability": "0.25"}
