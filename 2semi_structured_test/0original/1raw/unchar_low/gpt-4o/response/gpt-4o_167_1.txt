To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' Theorem. However, given the information, we can use a simpler approach based on the proportions in the sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

So, the probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that the description is of a computer science professor is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
