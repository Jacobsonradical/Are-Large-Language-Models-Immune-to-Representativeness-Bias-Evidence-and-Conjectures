In this scenario, we've been given information about a particular professor, Jason, and we are supposed to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor given this information. To do this, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Firstly, let’s define some terms:
- Let \( P(\text{CS}) \) be the probability that the professor is from computer science.
- Let \( P(\text{H}) \) be the probability that the professor is from the humanities.
- Let \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(E|\text{H}) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.
- Let \( P(E) \) be the overall probability of Jason’s description.

Since we know that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional specific information on the likelihood \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(E|\text{H}) \), we might initially assume these conditional probabilities are equal. This assumption is based on a lack of distinguishing factors in the description that would make one discipline significantly more likely than the other
