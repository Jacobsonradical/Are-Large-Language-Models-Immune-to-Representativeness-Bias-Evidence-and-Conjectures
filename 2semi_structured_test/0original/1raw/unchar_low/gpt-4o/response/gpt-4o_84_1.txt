Given the information provided, we should consider the base rates of the two groups: computer science professors and humanities professors. According to the study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Assuming that the personality description provided does not significantly favor one group over the other (i.e., it is equally likely to describe someone from either group), we can use the ratios of the groups to determine the probability.

The ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors is:
\[ \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
