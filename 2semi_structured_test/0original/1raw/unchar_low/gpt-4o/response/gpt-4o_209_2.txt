Given the problem setup, we know the total number of tenured and successful professors interviewed is 100, where 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities.

Without any additional specific information that heavily indicates Jason's field, we might rely on the base rates of the two groups. The base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is thus:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
