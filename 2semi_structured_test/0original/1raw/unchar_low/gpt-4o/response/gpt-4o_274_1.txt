Given that there are 100 professors in total with 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities, the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. Because the description provided does not contain specific information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors, we rely on the base rate for our probability estimate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
