{"probability": "0.25"}

Since the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability (before considering any other information) of Jason being a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. Given that the description does not provide distinctive information that differentiates significantly between the two groups, the initial prior remains the best estimate.
