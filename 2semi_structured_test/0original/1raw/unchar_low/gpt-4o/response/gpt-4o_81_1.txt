To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

First, we have the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Probability that a given professor is from computer science)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (Probability that a given professor is from the humanities)

We need to determine the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor and given that he is a humanities professor. Let's assume there's no substantial difference in the base rates of high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked between the two fields. Hence, the descriptions are equally likely to come from any of the two groups.

Thus, the likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(Description|CS)}{P(Description|Hum)} \) is approximately 1.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Given that \( P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|Hum) \), we can say that \( P(Description) \) is just a normalizing factor, and we can directly use the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS|Description) \approx P(CS
