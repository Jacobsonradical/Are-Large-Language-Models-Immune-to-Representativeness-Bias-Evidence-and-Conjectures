To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the total number of descriptions and the number of descriptions for each group.

There are a total of 100 professors: 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities. Since Jason was chosen at random, the probability that he is a computer science professor can be calculated using the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The probability is:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
