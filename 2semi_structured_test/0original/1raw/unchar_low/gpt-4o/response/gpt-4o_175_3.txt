To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to consider the proportions of computer science vs humanities professors in the sample. 

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, totaling 100 professors.

The base rate for a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate for a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

In the absence of any additional distinguishing information in the description that would statistically favor one group over the other, we should rely on these base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the base rate for computer science professors:

\[ P(CS|Description) \approx P(CS) \]

So, the probability is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
