{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is derived from the base rate of the two groups in the sample. Specifically, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, giving us a 1:3 ratio. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, when chosen at random based solely on the given description, is 25/(25+75) = 0.25.
