To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is used to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here's how we can set up the problem:

Initially, we know the overall proportion of computer science and humanities professors in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The prior probability \( P(\text{H}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description of Jason doesn't favor either group specifically and appears neutral:

1. Let's assume the likelihood \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) of Jason being described this way if he is a computer science professor is the same as the likelihood \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \) of Jason being described this way if he is a humanities professor.

Given this neutral assumption, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times
