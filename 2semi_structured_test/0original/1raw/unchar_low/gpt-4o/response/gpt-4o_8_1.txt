To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps for the calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is in the humanities, \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let's assume that the description applies equally likely to both groups based on the given information and no explicit distinction. Therefore, the likelihood of the description being of a professor in either group can be considered equivalent, for simplicity's sake.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
     \]

   - Since \( P(\
