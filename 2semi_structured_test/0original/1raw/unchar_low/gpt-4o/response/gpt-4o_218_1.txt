Based on the information given, we know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. The base rate (prior probability) for Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 or 0.25.

Given the description of Jason's personality traits and considering the interview information about strong motivation and high ability being somewhat common in both fields, without additional specific indicators distinguishing between computer science and humanities, it is reasonable to align closely with the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
