To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description provided does not give any specific information unique to either group, so we can assume the probability of the description fitting a professor from either group is equal.

Bayesian probability can be calculated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the computer science professors.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Since the description is equally likely to fit any professor (we assume equal likelihood), our calculation simplifies to comparing the base rates of the two groups. Thus:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Here \( P(\text{description}) \) is the same for both groups (since it is effectively a normalization constant which will cancel out), and:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) =
