To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100 (25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities).
- We need the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason’s description.

In our scenario:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the proportion of computer science professors in the sample).
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the proportion of humanities professors in the sample).

Assuming that the description provided does not favor one field over the other (since no specific clues point towards one discipline), we can assume that:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \)

Thus, for simplicity:
\[ P(A|B)
