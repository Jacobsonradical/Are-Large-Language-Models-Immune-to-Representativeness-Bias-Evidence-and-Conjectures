To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the total number of professors and the distribution between the two groups. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Firstly, we consider the base rate of each group:
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the description of Jason, there is no specific information that ties him more closely to one group over the other. Therefore, we use the base rate as our prior probability without additional adjustment based on the description provided.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
