To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's first consider the available data:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Given no additional information beyond the description of the professor (such as specific traits that are more common in either discipline), we need to rely on the base rates to estimate the probability.

The base rate for being a computer science professor is:
\[
\frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

The base rate for being a humanities professor is:
\[
\frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Since there is no specific information to suggest that Jason is more likely to belong to one group versus the other, we use these base rates directly. Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
