To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can set it up:

- Total number of professors: 100 (25 computer science + 75 humanities)
- The description provided doesn't give specific details pointing strongly toward one discipline over the other, so let's assume that the characteristics described are equally likely among both the computer science and humanities professors.

We use the base rate (prior probabilities) for solving this problem:

- Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since the description is assumed to be equally likely for professors in both groups (\( P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | H) \)), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description becomes the ratio of the prior probabilities. Calculating this:

\[ 
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS) * P(Description | CS)}{P(CS) * P(Description | CS) + P(H) * P(Description | H)} 
\]

Given our assumption:
\[ P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | H) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac
