In the given sample, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 descriptions. 

To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to look at the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors

Probability = 25 / 100

Probability = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
