To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \( B \) is the event "We have Jason's description."

Now, let's break it down:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Since the description does not provide specific details differentiating between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume the description is equally likely for professors from both disciplines.

Therefore:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|A) \) is unknown but assumed to be equal for both groups.
- \( P(B) \) is normalized across the total population, but
