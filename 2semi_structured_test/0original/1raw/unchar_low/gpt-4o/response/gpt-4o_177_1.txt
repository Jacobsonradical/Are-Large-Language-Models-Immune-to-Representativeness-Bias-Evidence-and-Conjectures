Sure, given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we start by noting that the probability of randomly selecting a professor who is in computer science is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

P(Computer Science) = 25/100 = 0.25

The problem does not provide any specific information about Jason that would skew the probability away from this base rate. Therefore, given only the general description, we would stick to this base rate.

{"probability": "0.25"}
