Given the description of Jason and the details of the sample, we should apply Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's define:
- \( P(CS) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

The base rates of the two groups are:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

This gives us the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

From the given description, there isn't specific information that differentiates the tendencies of the professors in the computer science group from those in the humanities group beyond what we already have from the base rates.

Thus, using Bayesian reasoning without additional distinguishing details, the probability remains essentially tied to the base rates.

Therefore, the probability \( P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.25 \).

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
