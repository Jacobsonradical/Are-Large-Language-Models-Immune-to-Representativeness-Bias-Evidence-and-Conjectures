To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We need the following probabilities:

1. The prior probability that a professor is from computer science, \(P(\text{CS})\).
2. The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities, \(P(\text{Hum})\).
3. The likelihood of Jason's description being characteristic of a computer science professor, \(P(\text{description}|\text{CS})\).
4. The likelihood of Jason's description being characteristic of a humanities professor, \(P(\text{description}|\text{Hum})\).

Since the description doesn't seem to favor one group over the other (it mentions general traits like "high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked"), we can assume that:

\(P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{description}|\text{Hum})\).

So we focus on the prior probabilities:

Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities. The prior probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To find the posterior probability \(P(\text{CS}|\text{description})\), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text
