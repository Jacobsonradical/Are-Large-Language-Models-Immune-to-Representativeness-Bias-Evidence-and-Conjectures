To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability based on new evidence. Here, we want to find out the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, let's define our events:
- C: Jason is a computer science professor.
- H: Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors (C).
- There are 75 humanities professors (H).

So the prior probabilities are:
- P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Without any additional information regarding the likelihood of having such a description for professors in the two groups, we assume the description is equally likely to apply to professors from either group. This means P(description|C) = P(description|H).

Therefore, the Bayesian update gives us:
\[ P(C|description) = \frac{P(description|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(description)} \]

Given that P(description|C) = P(description|H), the denominator P(description) is the same for both groups. Thus, we can simplify it to:
\[ P(C|description) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Using the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C|description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}
