Given the provided information, we need to determine the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor versus a professor in the humanities. Let's consider the base rates and the description given.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Based solely on these numbers, without additional information, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
\frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

The evidence provided in the description about Jason indicates that he is a high-ability and highly-motivated individual who is well-liked and has a positive professional reputation. While these traits can be found in both fields, they do not provide strong evidence to differentiate between the two, as they are likely common among successful academics in general.

Thus, the description does not significantly affect the initial probabilities derived from the proportions of professors sampled from each field.

Based on the principles of Bayesian inference, since the description is equally likely for professors from both fields, we should stick to the prior probability. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\{"probability": "0.25"\}
\]
