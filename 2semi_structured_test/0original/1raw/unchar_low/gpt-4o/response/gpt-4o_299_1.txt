To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant data:

- Total professors: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
- Description of Jason: No unique information specifically indicating his field.

Given these numbers, the prior probability (before considering additional information) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: {0.25} \] 

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
