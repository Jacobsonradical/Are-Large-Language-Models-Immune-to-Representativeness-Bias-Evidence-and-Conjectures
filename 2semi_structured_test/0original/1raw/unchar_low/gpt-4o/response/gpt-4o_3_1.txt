Given the description and the study's setup, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors out of the total of 100 professors sampled. 

First, we note the base rates provided in the study:

- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

Since we know nothing about Jason's specific field from the description provided, a reasonable starting point is to use these base rates, or prior probabilities, to estimate the probability.

Given this, the proportion of computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the proportion of humanities professors in the sample is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional distinguishing information in Jason's description that would heavily favor either field, we rely solely on the base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(\text{Jason is a CS Professor}) \approx 0.25 \]

This probability reflects the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.
