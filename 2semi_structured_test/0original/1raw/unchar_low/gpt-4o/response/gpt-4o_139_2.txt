Given the description provides no direct clues to distinguish between computer science professors and humanities professors, we need to rely on base rates from the study.

From the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{1}{4} \) or 0.25.
