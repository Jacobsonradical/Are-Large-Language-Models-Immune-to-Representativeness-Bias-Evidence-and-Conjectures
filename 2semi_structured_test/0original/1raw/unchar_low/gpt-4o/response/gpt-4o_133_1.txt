Given the description, our goal is to determine the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor compared to being a humanities professor. The information we have does not specifically favor one field over the other. Therefore, the decision must be based primarily on the relative proportions of the two groups in the study.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Likewise, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description does not provide field-specific details that distinguish Jason's expertise, we can base our probability estimate on these prior probabilities. Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Correspondingly, the probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors would be:

\[ P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

So, in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
