To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science
- 75 tenured and successful professors in humanities
- Description of Jason (known for his high ability and strong motivation)

First, we need to assume the probability that a randomly selected professor is from either group.
- Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we have no additional information that differentiates the descriptionâ€™s likelihood given the professor's field, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, we don't need to adjust these probabilities further based on the description alone.

Using these probabilities, we can directly estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | Hum) \) are considered equal based on our assumption, they cancel out in the ratio.

Thus,
