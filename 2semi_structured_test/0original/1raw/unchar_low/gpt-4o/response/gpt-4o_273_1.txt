To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
  
Thus, the total sample size is 100 professors. Without any additional specific distinguishing information that differentiates the personality traits between the two groups, we assume each professor from either group could have an equal likelihood of being Jason based on the given description.

The prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from Computer Science = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Hum) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from Humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

Given no additional information that would alter these base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is directly proportional to the prior probability.

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
