Given that the description does not provide specific information to differentiate between the computer science professors and the humanities professors, we can rely on the base rate of the two groups in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

Using the base rate to determine the probability, we find:

\[ \text{Probability that Jason is a computer science professor} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability is 0.25.
