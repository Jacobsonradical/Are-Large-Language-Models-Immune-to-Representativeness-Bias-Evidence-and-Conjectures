Given the description and the distribution of the professors in the study, we can utilize Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Let's define:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

We will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

However, without specific information on how descriptions differ between computer science and humanities professors, we make a simplifying assumption that the likelihood of Jason's description being typical for either group is roughly the same. Therefore, we use the prior probabilities which are based on the sample sizes:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we assume \( P(\text{description} | C) \approx P(\text{description} | H) \), it simplifies the equation to:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C
