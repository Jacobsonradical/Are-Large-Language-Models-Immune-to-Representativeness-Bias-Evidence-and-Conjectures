To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We start with the following information:

1. The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
2. The number of computer science professors is 25.
3. The number of humanities professors is 75.

Without any other specific distinguishing characteristics between computer science and humanities professors in the description, we should rely on the prior probability distribution:

- Probability (P) that Jason is a computer science professor = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- Probability (P) that Jason is a humanities professor = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Given that the description provides no additional evidence that suggests Jason is more likely to belong to one group over the other, we can directly use the prior probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
