To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(Hum) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the description of Jason, we don't have specific data to strongly suggest that he is more likely to be in one field than the other. Therefore, we would assume the description fits professors from both fields equally likely, which means the likelihoods (\( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | Hum) \)) would be the same. This simplifies our calculation as follows:

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, irrespective of the field:

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Since \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | Hum)
