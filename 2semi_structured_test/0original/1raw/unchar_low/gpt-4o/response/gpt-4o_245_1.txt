Given the description of Jason and the composition of the sample, we need to make a probabilistic assessment with the information provided.

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We are asked to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Since no specific details in Jason's description distinctly favor either field, we can assume that his traits and professional demeanor are equally likely to be found among both computer science and humanities professors. Therefore we can use the base rates (proportions) of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

The probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So, our answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
