Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we start by considering the base rate probabilities of randomly selecting a professor from each group. 

1. The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\), is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \(P(Hum)\), is:
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

- Jason is described as having high ability, strong motivation, and a positive professional reputation. These are traits that could be fairly common among successful academics, regardless of their field. 

Without specific information differentiating computer science professors from humanities professors on these traits, we will rely on the base rates alone. Therefore, the conditional probabilities do not change from the prior probabilities.

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\boxed{\text{probability: 0.25}}
\]

So, the formatted answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
