Given that Jason is randomly selected from a group of 100 professors (25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities), the prior probability, without considering additional details, that Jason is from the computer science group is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

So, the initial prior probability \( P(CS) \) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided for Jason ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation") is quite general and does not uniquely identify characteristics specific to either computer science or humanities professors, it might be challenging to update this probability meaningfully based on this description alone. If you consider the provided characteristics as neutral (i.e., equally likely for both groups), the probability doesn't significantly change.

Thus, based on the given information and assuming no additional bias, the probability that Jason is from the computer science group remains the same:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
