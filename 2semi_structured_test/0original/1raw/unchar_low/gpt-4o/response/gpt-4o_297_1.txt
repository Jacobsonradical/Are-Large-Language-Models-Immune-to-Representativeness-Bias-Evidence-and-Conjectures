Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, without additional information the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25 out of 100.

Thus, the initial probability is:

P(Computer Science) = 25/100 = 0.25

The description provided does not contain specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors. Therefore, we use the initial probability.

{"probability": "0.25"}
