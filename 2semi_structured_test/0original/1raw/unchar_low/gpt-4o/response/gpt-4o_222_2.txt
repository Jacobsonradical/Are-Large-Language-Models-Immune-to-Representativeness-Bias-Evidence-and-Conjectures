To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is one of the computer science professors is given by:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:
