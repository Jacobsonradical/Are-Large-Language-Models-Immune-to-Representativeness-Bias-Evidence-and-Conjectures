Given the information, we know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Without any other differentiating details specific to Jason being more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we should use the base rate probability.

The base rate probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, based solely on the given information:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
