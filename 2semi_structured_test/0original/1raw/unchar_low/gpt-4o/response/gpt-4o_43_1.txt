To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates):**
   - Number of computer science professors: 25
   - Number of humanities professors: 75
   - Total professors: 100

   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
   \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

   And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:
   \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   From the given description, there's no specific detail that strongly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we might assume the likelihoods are similar if the description provided an equal probability of being chosen for a computer science or humanities professor.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is: 
   
   \( P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) * P(CS)}{P(\text{description} | CS) * P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) * P(H)} \)
