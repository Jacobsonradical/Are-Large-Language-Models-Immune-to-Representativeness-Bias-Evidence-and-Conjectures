To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample. 

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100. Therefore, the probability that any randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is:

\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
