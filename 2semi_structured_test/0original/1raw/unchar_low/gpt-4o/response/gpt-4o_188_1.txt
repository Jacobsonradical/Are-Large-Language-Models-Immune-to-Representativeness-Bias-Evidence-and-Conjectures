{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The initial setup indicates that there are 25 computer science (CS) professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Without any additional specific information favoring one group over the other, we rely on the base rates provided. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of CS professors to the total number of professors, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
