To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study. 

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
