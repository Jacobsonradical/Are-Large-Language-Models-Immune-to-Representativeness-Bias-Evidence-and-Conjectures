Given the number of professors in each group, we can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.

We know that there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Jason is randomly chosen from these 100 professors

Without any additional information on how the description affects the distribution of the two groups, we can only rely on the prior distribution.

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without specific data on how descriptive traits are distributed between the two groups, we assume the description is equally likely to be generated by a professor from either group. This means the probability of the description given that Jason is from either group (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)), is the same.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is still based on the prior probability.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
