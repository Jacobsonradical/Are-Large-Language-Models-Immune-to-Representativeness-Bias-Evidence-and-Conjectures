Given the information, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors from the sample, given that he was randomly chosen from the 100 professors described.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:

- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Based on the description alone ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation"), there is no explicit information favoring humanities professors over computer science professors, or vice versa. Therefore, we assume that the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or humanities professor.

Thus, the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal, where \( D \) is the description given.

Because these likelihoods are equal, we only need to consider the prior probabilities:

So, \( P(C|D) \) = \( \frac{P(C) \cdot P(D|C)}{P(C) \cdot P(D|
