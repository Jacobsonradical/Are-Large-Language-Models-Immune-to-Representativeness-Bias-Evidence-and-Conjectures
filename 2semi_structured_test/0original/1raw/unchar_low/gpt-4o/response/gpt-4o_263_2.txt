To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we note that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to calculate the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group given his description. Since nothing in the description explicitly biases towards either group, we assume descriptions are generated independently of the field of study.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \) can be calculated using the ratio of the priors:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
