Given the information provided and the need to calculate probabilities based on available data, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. 

First, some basic statistics from the data:
- Total professors: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
- Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (P(H)): 75/100 = 0.75

What we need is the likelihood that Jason, given his description, belongs to the computer science group compared to the humanities group. However, since the description does not provide specific clues that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors based on the metrics used in the study (ability, motivation, colleague likability, and reputation), we assume these traits could be equally distributed between both groups.

Therefore, without specific distinguishing information, we assume the description fits computer science and humanities professors equally well. 

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS)P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]

Here:
- \( P(Jason | CS) \) = Probability that a person described as Jason is from computer science, assumed to be the same for humanities.
- \( P(CS) \) = 0.25
- \( P(Jason) \) = Total probability of drawing such a professor from all,
