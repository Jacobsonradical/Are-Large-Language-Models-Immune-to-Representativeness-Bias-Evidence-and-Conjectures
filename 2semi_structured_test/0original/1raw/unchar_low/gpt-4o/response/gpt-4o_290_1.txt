To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor).

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) given new evidence (Jason's description) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the event, times the prior probability of the event.

However, without specific evidence on how likely the description provided fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, it is impossible to directly compute the probabilities:

\[P(C \mid \text{description}) \propto P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)\]
\[P(H \mid \text{description}) \propto P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)\]

In the absence of any specific information differentiating the likelihood of Jason's description depending on whether he is a computer science or humanities professor, we assume the description is equally likely
