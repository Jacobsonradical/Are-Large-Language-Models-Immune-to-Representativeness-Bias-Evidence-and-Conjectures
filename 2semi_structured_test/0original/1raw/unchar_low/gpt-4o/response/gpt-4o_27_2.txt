Given the information provided, we are dealing with a classic example of the base rate fallacy in probability estimation. The base rates (prior probabilities) for computer science professors and humanities professors should be considered:

Number of computer science professors: 25
Number of humanities professors: 75
Total number of professors: 100

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without any specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors besides the given description (which is quite general and could apply to someone in either discipline), the rational approach is to rely primarily on the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based solely on the base rates, would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}
