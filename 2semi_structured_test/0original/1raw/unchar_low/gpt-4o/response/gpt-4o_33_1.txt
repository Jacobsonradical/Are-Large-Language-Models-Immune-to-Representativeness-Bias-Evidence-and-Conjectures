To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we need the prior probabilities and likelihoods. 

First, let's consider the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
P(CS) = 25 / 100 = 0.25
And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
P(Hum) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Next, we consider the description of Jason. The description includes traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked. These traits are fairly common among successful academics in both fields, so we might assume that the likelihood of these traits is roughly similar for professors in both fields. 

If we denote P(D|CS) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and P(D|Hum) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, and assume these probabilities are roughly equal, we can simplify our calculation. For simplicity, let's assume:

P(D|CS) ≈ P(D|Hum)

So, according to Bayes’ theorem:

P(CS|D) = [P(D|CS) * P(CS)] / [P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|Hum) * P(H
