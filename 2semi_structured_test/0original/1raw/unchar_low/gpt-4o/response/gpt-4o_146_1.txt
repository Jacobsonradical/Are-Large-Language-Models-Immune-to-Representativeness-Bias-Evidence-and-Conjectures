To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided for Jason.

From the information given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

Since the description does not give specific evidence differentiating between computer science and humanities professors besides general traits, we simplify the conditional probabilities \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- Assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \) because the description fits both groups equally well.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), \( P(D) \) can be simplified as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

This translates to:
\[ P(D)
