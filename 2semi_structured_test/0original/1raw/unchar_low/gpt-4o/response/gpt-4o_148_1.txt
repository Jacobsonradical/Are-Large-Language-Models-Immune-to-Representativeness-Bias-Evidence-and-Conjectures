Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rates for each group are 0.25 (for computer science) and 0.75 (for humanities), respectively.

The description provided for Jason does not distinctly favor either field, as characteristics such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are common traits for successful individuals in any academic discipline. Therefore, lacking additional specific information, the probability should be based on the proportion of each group in the sample.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is as follows:
