To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this case, we'll consider the base rate of computer science professors in the sample and assume that the description is equally likely for both groups since there are no significant distinguishing features provided in the description that clearly favor one group over the other.

We have:

- The probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(\mathrm{CS}) \)) is 25%.
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(\mathrm{Humanities}) \)) is 75%.

Since the description is equally likely to apply to either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we can assume that the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{CS}) \)) is the same as the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{Humanities}) \)). Both probabilities can be considered equal.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(\mathrm{CS}|\mathrm{Description}) = \frac{P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{CS}) \cdot P(\mathrm{CS})}{P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{CS}) \cdot P(\mathrm{CS}) + P(\mathrm{Description}|\mathrm{Humanities}) \cdot P(\mathrm{Humanities})}
\]
