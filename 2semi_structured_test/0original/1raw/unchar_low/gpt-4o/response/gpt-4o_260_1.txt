To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**

   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**

   Assuming the description of Jason being highly able, highly motivated, and well-liked is equally likely among successful academics in both fields, we can denote:
   - \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**

   According to Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]
   Since the description is equally likely in both groups and given that we are looking at a randomly chosen description from the combined pool, \(P(description)\) cancels out. We then have:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{ P(CS) }{ P(CS) + P(H) }
   \]
   Substituting the priors:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.
