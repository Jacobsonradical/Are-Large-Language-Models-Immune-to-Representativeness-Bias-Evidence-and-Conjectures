The study includes 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science out of a total of 100 professors. Therefore, before considering any specifics of the description provided for Jason, the base rate probability that any random professor from the sample is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{Base rate} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

If we consider the description provided for Jason, it does not include any details that might distinctly differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors based on the common stereotypes or characteristics of these fields. His high ability, strong motivation, and positive social reputation could equally apply to both groups. 

Without additional distinguishing information in the description, we rely on the base rate provided by the study's sample distribution.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be expressed as:
 
\[ \text{probability} = 0.25\]
