Given the information provided, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups of professors. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

We are looking to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description. Without additional distinguishing information that biases towards one group, we should primarily rely on the base rates.

The base rate for computer science professors in the sample is:
\( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The base rate for humanities professors in the sample is:
\( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since Jason's description does not significantly lean towards characteristics that are stereotypically associated with either group and given the random selection, we apply these base rates directly. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.25.
