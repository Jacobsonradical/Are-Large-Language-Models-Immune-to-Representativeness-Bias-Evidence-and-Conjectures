To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, you can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows you to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of observing the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability of observing the description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(CS|D) \) as the posterior probability that the professor is from computer science given the description.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have specific information to differentiate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \), let's assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum)
