To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, we note the number of professors in each field:

- \(n_{CS} = 25\) (computer science professors)
- \(n_{Hum} = 75\) (humanities professors)

The total number of professors is:

\[ n_{Total} = n_{CS} + n_{Hum} = 100 \]

Since the description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{Total}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{n_{Hum}}{n_{Total}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description does not contain specific information that discriminates between computer science and humanities professors beyond their professional success and personal characteristics, which are common to both groups.

Therefore, we calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor without updating this probability based on specific posterior information:

\[ P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
