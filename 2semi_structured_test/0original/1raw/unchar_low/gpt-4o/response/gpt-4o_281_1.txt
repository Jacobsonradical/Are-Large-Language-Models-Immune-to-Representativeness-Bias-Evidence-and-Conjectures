{"probability": "0.25"}

The study sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without additional specific information linking Jason's description more strongly to either group, the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes are the best estimate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
