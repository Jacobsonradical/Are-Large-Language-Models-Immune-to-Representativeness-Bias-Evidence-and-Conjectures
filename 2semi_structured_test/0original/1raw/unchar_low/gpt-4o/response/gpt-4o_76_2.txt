To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem and use the base rates provided.

We know the following:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that Jason is chosen from the 100 professors at random:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

However, since the description provided does not give a specific trait that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we treat it as neutral information. Thus, it provides equal likelihood for both types of professors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given a neutral description, remains based on the base rate calculated above:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability is:
