To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors sampled, since we have no additional specific information that favors one group over the other. 

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Using basic probability, the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors sampled:

\( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
