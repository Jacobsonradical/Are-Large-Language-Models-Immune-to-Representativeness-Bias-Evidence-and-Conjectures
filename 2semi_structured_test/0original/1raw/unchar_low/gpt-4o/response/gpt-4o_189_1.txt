To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being like Jason's given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that someone is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description given by any professor.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) (probability of being a humanities professor) \( = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

If we have no further distinguishing information between humanities and computer science professors that could affect their personality descriptions (assuming they could be equally likely), the probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) could be considered equal. This makes the Bayesian update straightforward.

Assuming \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), the posterior probability simplifies:
