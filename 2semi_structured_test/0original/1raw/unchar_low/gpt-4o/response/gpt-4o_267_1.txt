Given the information described, we need to consider the base rates provided in this scenario. From the original study, we know that:

- 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
- 75 out of 100 professors are from the humanities.

Hence, the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25%, or 0.25.

The description provided does not include specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors. We thus rely on the base rate for our calculation.

So, our estimated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
