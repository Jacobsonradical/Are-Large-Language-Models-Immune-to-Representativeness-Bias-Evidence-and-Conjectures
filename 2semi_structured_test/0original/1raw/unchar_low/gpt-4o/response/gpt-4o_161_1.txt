Given the description, letâ€™s calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem. We need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (C) given that he matches the description (D).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description overall.

First, let's determine each component.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \)**:
Since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, the prior probability \( P(C) \) is:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Probability of Description \( P(D) \)**:
Since Jason was chosen at random and we have no information that suggests the description is more likely for either group, we assume the description is equally likely for any professor. Thus, the overall probability of having such a description is the average probability from both groups.
Without specifics, we can assume each group is equally likely to match this description
