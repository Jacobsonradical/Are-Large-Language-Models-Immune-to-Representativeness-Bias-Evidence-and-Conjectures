To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the proportion of computer science professors in the initial sample, as well as any additional information provided in the description.

The sample consists of:
- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the computer science field is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Likewise, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the humanities is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided about Jason does not contain specific information that strongly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, in the absence of such distinguishing details, we rely solely on the prior probabilities.

Given this, the probability can be computed directly from the prior proportions:

\[ P(Jason \text{ is a CS professor}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
