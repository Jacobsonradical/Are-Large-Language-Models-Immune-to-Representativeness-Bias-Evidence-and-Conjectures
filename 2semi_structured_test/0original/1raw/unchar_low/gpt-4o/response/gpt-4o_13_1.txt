Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probabilities are as follows:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (P(Hum)): 75/100 = 0.75

The description provided for Jason does not contain any specific information that would significantly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, so we rely mainly on the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}
