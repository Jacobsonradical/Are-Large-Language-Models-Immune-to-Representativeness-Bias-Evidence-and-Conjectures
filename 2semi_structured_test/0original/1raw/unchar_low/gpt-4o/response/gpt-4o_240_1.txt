Given that we have 100 professors in total, with 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities, and assuming that the description provided does not include any specific details that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we can use the base rate to determine the probability.

The probability \(P(CS)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
