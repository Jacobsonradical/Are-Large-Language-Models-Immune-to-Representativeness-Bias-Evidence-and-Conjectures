Given the information provided, the primary factor we must consider is the relative proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study. According to the study:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Without any additional specific information that would distinguish Jason as being more likely to be in one group or the other, we should use the base rates from the study. 

The probability Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) can be calculated using the total number of professors and the number in each group:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore:
