To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' theorem. First, we note the base rates: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which gives us the following prior probabilities:

- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to assume that the description given for Jason is equally likely to fit either a computer science professor or a humanities professor (in the absence of specific information to differentiate between the two groups based on personality traits or demographics).

Under this assumption, the likelihood of the provided description fitting either group is the same.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (denoted as \( D \)) is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given our assumption that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), and since the description equally matches both groups, we can simplify this to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Since \( P(CS
