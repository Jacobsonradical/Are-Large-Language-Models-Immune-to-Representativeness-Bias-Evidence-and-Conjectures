Given the information provided in the description and the structure of the study, the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25 out of 100 professors, or 25%.

Based on the description alone, there is no specific information that would distinctly favor either group (computer science or humanities), making it difficult to adjust the probability away from the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample can be given as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}
