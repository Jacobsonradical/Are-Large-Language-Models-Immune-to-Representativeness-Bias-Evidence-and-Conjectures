Explanation:
Given the distribution of professors, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This implies that there is a 25% (or 0.25) chance that any randomly selected professor's description pertains to a computer science professor, assuming no additional specific information that strongly differentiates between the two groups.
