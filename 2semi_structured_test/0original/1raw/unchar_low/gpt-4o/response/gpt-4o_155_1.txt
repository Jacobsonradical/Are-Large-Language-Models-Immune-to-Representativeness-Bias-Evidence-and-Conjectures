Based on the given information, the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Judging by Description:**
   - The description provided does not significantly favor one field over the other. It mentions general qualities like ability, motivation, and social reputation, which could apply equally to both computer science and humanities professors.

Therefore, the best we can do in the absence of additional differentiating information is to rely on the prior probabilities.

Given these points, the probability that Jason is from computer science is the base rate of that group:

{"probability": "0.25"}
