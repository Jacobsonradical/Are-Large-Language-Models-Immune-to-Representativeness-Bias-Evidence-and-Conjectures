Given the information from the study, we know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

and the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[
P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

The description given matches a common stereotype of a successful academic in both fields (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues). Thus, without additional distinguishing information that biases towards one field over another, we should rely on the base rates for our probability.

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS) \cdot P(Description|CS)}{P(Description)} = \frac{0.25 \cdot P(Description|CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since P(Description|CS) and P(Description|Humanities) are not given specific values and we assume them to be equally likely because the description matches both fields well, we can simplify our calculation to rely mostly on the base rates:

Thus:

\[
P(CS|Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer
