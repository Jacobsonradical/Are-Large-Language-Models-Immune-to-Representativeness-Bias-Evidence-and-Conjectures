To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's outline the relevant information:
- We have two groups of professors: 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (HU).
- A description of one professor, chosen at random, is provided.

To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (P(CS|D)), given his description (D), we can use the following formula:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(HU) \) is the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|HU) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since the description is generic and does not provide specific information that might discriminate between the computer
