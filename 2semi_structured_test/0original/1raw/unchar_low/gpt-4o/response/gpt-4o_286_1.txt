To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. 

First, we start with the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \), is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we analyze the description of Jason. Provided the description does not differentiate between the disciplines (meaning Jason's characteristics are not exclusively more common in either field), we assume equal likelihood of such a description arising from either group. For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum) = 1 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem formula in this context is:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{ P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(Description) } \]

Since \( P(Description) \) is the same regardless of CS or Hum due to equal likelihood assumptions, it can be ignored in a comparative probability calculation. Therefore, the posterior probability simplifies to:  

\[ P(CS | Description
