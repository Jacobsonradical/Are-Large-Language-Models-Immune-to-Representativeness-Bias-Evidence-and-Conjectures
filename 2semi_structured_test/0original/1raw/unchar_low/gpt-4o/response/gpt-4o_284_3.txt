{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer is based on the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given no other distinguishing information, is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\( P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
