Given that we know the composition of the sample (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors), we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the described characteristics that apply to Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A') \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming that the description does not favor one group significantly over the other (this assumption is needed due to lack of specific data on how the descriptions are distributed between the groups):
- \( P(B|A) \) â‰ˆ \( P(B|A') \) = The description is equally likely for professors in either group.

Since our assumption makes \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) approximately equal and they are
