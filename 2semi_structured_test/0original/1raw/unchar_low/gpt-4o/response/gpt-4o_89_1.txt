Given that you have 25 tenured successful professors in computer science (CS) and 75 tenured successful professors in the humanities (H), the total sample size is 100 professors. Assuming that the description of Jason does not contain any specific traits that differentiate between CS and humanities professors, the probability can be calculated based on their proportions in the sample population.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description of Jason}) \) can be calculated using the ratio of CS professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description of Jason}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Substituting the given numbers:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description of Jason}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus:

{"probability": "0.25"}
