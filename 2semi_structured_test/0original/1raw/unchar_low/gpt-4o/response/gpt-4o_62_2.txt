To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem calculates the conditional probability by incorporating prior knowledge or evidence. The formula for Bayesâ€™ theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( A \) given the evidence \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of evidence \( B \) given hypothesis \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of evidence \( B \).

In this scenario:
- Hypothesis \( A \) is that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Evidence \( B \) is the description of Jason.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description does not give any specific trait heavily favoring one group over the other beyond the stated positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation), we may need to assume those
