Based on the information given, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Without any additional information that statistically distinguishes the traits of professors in each discipline, we can rely on the base rates provided by the sample numbers.

The probability \(P\) that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated using the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[
P(\text{computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
