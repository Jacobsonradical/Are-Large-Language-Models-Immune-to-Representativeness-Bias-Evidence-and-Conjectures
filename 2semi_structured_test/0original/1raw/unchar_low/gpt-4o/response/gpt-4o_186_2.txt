To determine the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Determine the base rates (prior probabilities):
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the total number of professors is 100.

   The prior probability (base rate) that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. Evaluate how the given description fits both groups. Without additional specific information favoring one group over the other in terms of the description provided, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups. Hence, P(description | CS) = P(description | H).

3. Apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Since the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability.

\[ 
P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Since P(description) is the same
