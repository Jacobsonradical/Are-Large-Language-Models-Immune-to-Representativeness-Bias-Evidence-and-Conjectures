Given the information, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors among the sample. We can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning.

First, let's look at the base rates:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Without additional information, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The given description indicates that Jason is highly able, strongly motivated, and well-liked. However, we do not have any information suggesting these traits are more or less likely in either field based on the data provided about distributions of these characteristics in computer science versus humanities.

Since the description doesn't provide any additional discriminative information regarding the likelihood of these traits in either population, we fall back on the prior probabilities.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
