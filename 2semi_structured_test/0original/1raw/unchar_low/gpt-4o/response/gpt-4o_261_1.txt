Given the information provided, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's acknowledge the base rates:
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The probability of randomly picking a computer science professor from the total sample is:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided doesn't significantly distinguish between the two groups based on unique traits more likely to belong to one group over the other, we would use the base rates as our best estimate. 

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ P(\text{Jason is a CS professor}) = 0.25 \]

So the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
