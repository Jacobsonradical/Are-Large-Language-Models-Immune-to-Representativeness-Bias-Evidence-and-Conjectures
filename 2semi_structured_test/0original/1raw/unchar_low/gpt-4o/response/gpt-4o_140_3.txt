First, let's note the base rates for computer science and humanities professors in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which means that the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description provided for Jason does not include specific information that would significantly differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors in terms of their traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation). These characteristics are likely common to successful academics in general.

Thus, without additional differentiating information, we will rely on the base rates for our probability estimate.

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample remains at the base rate:
