Given the information provided, let's analyze the problem using Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability.

First, we know the following:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

We are provided with a description and need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on this description. If we assume that the description doesn't provide specific details that distinguish between the disciplines (as per the given problem), then we can calculate the prior probability based solely on the numbers of professors.

Using Bayes' Theorem for this context, the probability \(P(CS|D)\) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, without any additional distinguishing information, we can assume the descriptions are equally likely for computer science and humanities professors. Thus, \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) would be equal if we assume no additional bias.

Given:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (prior probability that a randomly chosen
