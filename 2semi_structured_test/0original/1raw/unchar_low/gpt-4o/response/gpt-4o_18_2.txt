{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 25 out of a total of 100 professors. Thus, the baseline probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is 25%. The given description does not provide specific details that distinguish Jason as more likely belonging to either the computer science or the humanities group, so the probability remains at the base rate.
