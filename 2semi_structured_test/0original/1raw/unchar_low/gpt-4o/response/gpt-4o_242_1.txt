Given the information provided in the description, I will use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

Firstly, let's establish the base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability (base rate) of Jason being a computer science professor is `25 / 100 = 0.25`.

Since the description mentions high ability, motivation, and positive relationships with colleagues—traits likely to be common among all successful professors—we don't have specific information to significantly update our prior probability in favor of either field.

Therefore, based on the base rate alone, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
