To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should first consider the base rates provided in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study. This means the probability of randomly picking a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) and the probability of picking a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

However, the description of Jason does not provide any specific attributes strongly indicating a preference for either computer science or humanities. Given this lack of distinguishing information in the description, we rely on the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
