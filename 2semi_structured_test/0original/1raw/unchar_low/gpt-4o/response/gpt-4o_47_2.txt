Given that you are selecting a description at random from a sample that includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we have to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided information.

Since there is no specific information provided that directly distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors in the description, we can assume that the likelihood of this description fitting either type of professor is neutral. Therefore, the probabilities are determined by the proportion of each group in the sample.

The total number of professors in the sample is 100. Therefore:

- The probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given these proportions and no additional differentiating information in the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
