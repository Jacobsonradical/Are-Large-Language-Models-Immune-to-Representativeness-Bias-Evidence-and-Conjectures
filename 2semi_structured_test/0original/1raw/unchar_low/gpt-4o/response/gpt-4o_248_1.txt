Based on the information provided and the distribution of the sample, we know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there is a 25% chance that any randomly chosen description pertains to a computer science professor and a 75% chance it pertains to a humanities professor.

The given description of Jason does not provide specific information that distinguishes him as belonging to either group. Therefore, the probability solely based on the sample distribution remains unaltered.
