To determine the probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
Total, there are 100 professors.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description provided could equally and independently fit any of the professors and does not favor one field over another:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, we can approximate:
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A|B
