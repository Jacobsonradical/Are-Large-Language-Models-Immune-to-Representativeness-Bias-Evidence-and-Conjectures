To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we need to consider the ratio of professors in each field within the sample.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

The total number of professors is \( 25 + 75 = 100 \).

Without any additional specific information about Jason that is uniquely distinguishing between fields, we use the base rate of professors in each field.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated by dividing the number of computer science professors by the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
