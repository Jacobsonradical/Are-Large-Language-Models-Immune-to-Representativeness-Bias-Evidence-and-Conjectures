To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) as the description given of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Using Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\).

First, let's determine \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we have no specific reason to believe one group (computer science or humanities professors) is more likely than the other to fit the given description, we'll assume the description \(D\) is equally likely for both groups:
- \(P(D|
