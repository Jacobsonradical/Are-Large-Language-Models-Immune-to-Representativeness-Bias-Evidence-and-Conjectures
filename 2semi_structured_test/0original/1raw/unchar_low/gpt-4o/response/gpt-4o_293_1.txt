To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps in updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's the calculation in a straightforward manner:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - The prior probability (P(CS)) is the proportion of computer science professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary Probability**:
   - Similarly, the prior probability of a professor being from the humanities (P(Hum)) is: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood**:
   - The description provided does not give specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. We assume the likelihood (P(Description | CS) and P(Description | Hum)) is similar for both groups if no additional distinguishing traits are mentioned.

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Given no distinguishing information from the description, the probabilities are weighted simply by the prior probabilities.

Since the description does not provide extra distinguishing information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors, the probabilities remain proportional to the initial group sizes:

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description |
