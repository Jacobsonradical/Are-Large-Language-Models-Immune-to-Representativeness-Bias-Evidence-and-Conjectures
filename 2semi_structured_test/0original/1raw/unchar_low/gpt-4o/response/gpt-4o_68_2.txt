Given the information, we know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information specific to Jason that might strongly indicate one field over the other, we can use the base rates of the two groups to estimate the probability.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

Given that there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, the probability is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
