To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we must apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem can be used to determine conditional probabilities. It is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor from the pool of professors.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of having Jason's description.

We know the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) (probability of picking a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( 1 - P(A) \) (probability of picking a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the provided description does not specify any particular traits that are uniquely indicative of either humanities or computer science professors, we assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B| \neg A) \) (where \( \neg A \) denotes being a humanities professor) to be equal or similar due to a
