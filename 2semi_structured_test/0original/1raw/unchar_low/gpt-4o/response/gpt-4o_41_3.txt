To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s the setup:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

We are interested in P(CS|Jason), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Using Bayes' theorem, we need to compute:
\[ P(CS|Jason) = \frac{P(Jason|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]

Where:
- \( P(Jason|CS) \) is the probability that Jason fits the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(Jason) \) is the overall probability of a professor fitting the description given, which can be expanded as:
  \[ P(Jason) = P(Jason|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
  where \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability of someone being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

For simplicity, assuming personality descriptions are equally likely for both CS and humanities
