Given that Jason is randomly chosen from the group of 100 professors, there are two primary pieces of information to consider:

1. The overall sampling proportions:
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.

2. The description details provided for Jason:
   - He is a 30-year-old man, married without children.
   - He is known for his high ability and strong motivation.
   - He is well-liked by his colleagues and enjoys a positive reputation.

From the information given, there are no clear indicators that can strongly differentiate Jason as a computer science professor or a humanities professor, given that key traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and good reputation could be common among successful academics in either field.

Since we're randomly selecting Jason from the total sample of 100 professors and there is no distinguishing detail provided that skews towards one field over the other, we should rely on the base rates of the sampling proportions.

The probability Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated based on the base rates:

- Probability (Computer Science Professor) = Number of Computer Science Professors / Total Number of Professors
- Probability (Computer Science Professor) = 25 / 100
- Probability (Computer Science Professor) = 0.25

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
