To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Below are the steps involved:

1. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample.

Given data:
   - Number of computer science professors = 25
   - Number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 100

So:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Evaluate \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Hum) \):
   - \( P(Description | CS) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(Description | Hum) \) is the probability of observing Jasonâ€™s description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since the problem does not provide specific information about the likelihood of the description given the subject matter, we assume that the likelihood of such a description occurring for either type of professor is equally likely. Thus:
   - \( P(Description | CS) \
