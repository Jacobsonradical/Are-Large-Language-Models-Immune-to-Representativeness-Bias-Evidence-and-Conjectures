{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. The description provided does not include specific information to distinguish between disciplines, so the base rate remains the most reliable estimate.
