To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the information we have:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- A description is chosen at random from these 100 descriptions.

The probability we want to find is P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Here's the information we need:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor. This is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(Description | CS) \): The likelihood of the description being associated with a computer science professor. Without specific information about how the description relates to being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we assume this probability is equal for both groups.
- \( P(Description) \): The overall probability of picking that description. Since we do not have specific distinguishing factors, we consider the overall probability to be the same for both groups.

Because \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Humanities) \) are assumed equal, the formula simplifies to using the ratio of the sizes of the groups.

Thus:

\[ P(CS | Description)
