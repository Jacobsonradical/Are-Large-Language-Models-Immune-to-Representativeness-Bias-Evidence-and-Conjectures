To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We don't have any additional information that specifically differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors based on Jason's description. Therefore, we use the proportion of the two groups in the sample to determine the probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
