To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups and the description provided.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) for the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) for the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100.

Given that Jason is chosen at random from the 100 descriptions, the base rate probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description provided does not contain specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors other than general traits like high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, and being well-liked. Since these traits are common among successful academics in both fields and no additional distinguishing information is provided:

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate probability of randomly choosing a computer science professor.

Therefore, the probability \( P(C) \) is \( 0.25 \).
