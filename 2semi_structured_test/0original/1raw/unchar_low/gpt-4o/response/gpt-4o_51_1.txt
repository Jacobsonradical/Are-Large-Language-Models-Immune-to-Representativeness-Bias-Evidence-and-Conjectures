To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The provided description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description.

First, letâ€™s set the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science sample.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities sample.

Given the sample sizes:
\[
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Assume that the descriptions provided by the psychologists are equally likely for professors in both fields (a simplifying assumption), then:
