Given the number of professors in each group, we have the following data:
- 25 professors in computer science
- 75 professors in the humanities

The total number of professors is 100. Thus, the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ \text{Probability (CS Professor)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided for Jason does not give any specific indicators that clearly distinguish between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we will use the base rate probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
