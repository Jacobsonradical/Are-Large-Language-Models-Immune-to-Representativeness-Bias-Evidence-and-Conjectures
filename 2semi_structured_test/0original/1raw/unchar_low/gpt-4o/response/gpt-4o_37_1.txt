**Explanation:** 
The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. The total number of professors is 100. The prior probability of randomly choosing a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25. Given the description, there are no specific details that strongly differentiate Jason as either a computer science or humanities professor. Therefore, the reasonable approach here is to rely on the prior probabilities. This does not change unless additional information significantly altering the odds is provided.
