Given the description of Jason and the fact that he is chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, we need to use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's set up our priors:
- The number of computer science professors (C) is 25.
- The number of humanities professors (H) is 75.

The total number of professors (T) is 100.

Now, the prior probability, which is the base rate, for Jason being a computer science professor is:
P(C) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
P(C) = 25 / 100
P(C) = 0.25

Similarly, the base rate for Jason being a humanities professor is:
P(H) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors
P(H) = 75 / 100
P(H) = 0.75

Since we have no additional specific information about Jason that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors (e.g., field-specific traits), we rely solely on the base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains at the prior probability.
