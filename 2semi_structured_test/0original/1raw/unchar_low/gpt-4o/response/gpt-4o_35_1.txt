Given the setup of the problem, we are told that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. 

The description of Jason does not provide any direct indicative information about his specific field (computer science or humanities). Therefore, in the absence of any distinguishing data in his description, the best estimate we can make relies on the base rate provided by the sample sizes.

The probability \(P(CS|D)\) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description can be approximated by the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
