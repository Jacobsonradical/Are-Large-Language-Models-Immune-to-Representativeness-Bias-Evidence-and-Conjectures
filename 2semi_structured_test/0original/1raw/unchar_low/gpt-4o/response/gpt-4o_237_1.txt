Based on the information given, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probability that any randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that distinctly favors either field (such as specific interests or activities strongly associated with one field over the other). Assuming the provided traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are equally probable across both groups:

{"probability": "0.25"}
