Based on the information provided, we know that there are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. This forms a total of 100 professors, where 25% are from computer science and 75% are from humanities.

Given that we only have a description of Jason and no additional distinguishing features indicative of a particular field (such as specific interests or data related to his work in computer science versus humanities), we will rely on the base rates of the two groups.

To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
