To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a brief outline of the approach:

1. **Prior Probability of Being in Each Group**: 
   - Probability of being a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor: \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood of the Description Given Each Group**:
   This step might involve subjective judgment without specific data on how likely the description is for each group. However, since nothing in the description seems to strongly favor either group, we can assume the description is equally likely for a professor in either discipline.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayesian updating formula: 
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   Since we assume general features in the likelihood of the description being equal for both groups:
   \[
   P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)
   \]
   Thus, the relative weights are the prior probabilities. Simplified, the posterior probability \( P(CS | Description) \) evaluates to the initial prior based on sample proportions.

Thus, given equal likelihood for the description
