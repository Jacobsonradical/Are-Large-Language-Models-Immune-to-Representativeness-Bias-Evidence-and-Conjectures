To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- A description matches Jason, and we need to determine whether he is a computer science professor.

First, let's define:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a description is of a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

The probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional distinguishing details between the fields, we'll assume that the likelihood of Jason's description being written is similar for both groups, meaning \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately equal. Therefore, the probability calculation simplifies to the base rate:

\[ \text{Posterior probability} = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0
