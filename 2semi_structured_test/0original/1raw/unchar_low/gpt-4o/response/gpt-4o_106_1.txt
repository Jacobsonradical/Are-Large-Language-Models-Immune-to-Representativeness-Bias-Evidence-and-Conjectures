To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, the provided description does not give specific information that can distinctly identify someone as a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on traits that would skew the likelihood one way or another. Therefore, we must rely solely on the base rates (prior probabilities) provided by the sample sizes.

Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the base rates (prior probabilities):
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Since the description does not provide additional discriminatory information, we use these base rates directly.

Given no additional discriminatory information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25. Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
