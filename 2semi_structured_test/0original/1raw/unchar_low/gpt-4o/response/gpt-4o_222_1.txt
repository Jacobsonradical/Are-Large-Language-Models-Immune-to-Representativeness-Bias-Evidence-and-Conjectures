To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason is one of these professors.

We need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason's description.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Without specific likelihood values, we assume that the description is as likely
