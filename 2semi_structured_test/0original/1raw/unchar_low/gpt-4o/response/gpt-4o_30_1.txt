Sure. Given that Jason is known for his high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation among colleagues, we need to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor. 

Out of the 100 professors, 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities. Assuming that there is no inherent bias in the traits that would make them more likely in one field over the other, we can use the proportion of professors in each field to determine the probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Therefore:

\{
"probability": "0.25"
\}
