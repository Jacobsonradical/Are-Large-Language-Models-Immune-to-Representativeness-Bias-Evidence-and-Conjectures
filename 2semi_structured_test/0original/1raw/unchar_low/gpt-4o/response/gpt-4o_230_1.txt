Given the provided information, we need to use Bayes’ theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's define the terms:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): The prior probability that a professor is from humanities.
- \( P(X \mid \text{CS}) \): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(X \mid \text{Humanities}) \): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to calculate \( P(\text{CS} \mid X) \), the probability that Jason is from computer science given his description.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
$$ P(\text{CS} \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(X \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(X \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
