Certainly! To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rate given in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability (base rate) of selecting a computer science professor at random is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor at random is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional specific information in Jason's description that differentiates him significantly in a way that can be tied more likely to either computer science or humanities, we can only rely on these base rates. Given the description provided does not strongly favor one field over the other, the reasonable approach is to use the base rate probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
