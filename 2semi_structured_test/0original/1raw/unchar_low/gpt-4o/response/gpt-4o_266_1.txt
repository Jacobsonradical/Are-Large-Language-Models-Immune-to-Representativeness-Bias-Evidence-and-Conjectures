Given the conditions of the study and assuming no other details are provided to differentiate Jason from other candidates, the base rate (prior probability) must be considered. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given no additional information is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the entire sample:

P(Computer Science) = Number of Computer Science Professors / Total Number of Professors
P(Computer Science) = 25 / 100
P(Computer Science) = 0.25

Therefore, the probability is 0.25.
