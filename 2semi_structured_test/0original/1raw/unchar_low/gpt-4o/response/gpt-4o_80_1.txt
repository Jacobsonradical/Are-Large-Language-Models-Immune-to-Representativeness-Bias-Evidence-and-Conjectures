Given the description, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, we can use the base rates to calculate the probability. 

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(D \mid \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(D \mid \text{H}) P(\text{H})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid \text{H}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have specific information that differentiates the description for a computer science professor from a humanities professor, we can assume \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D \mid \text{H}) \) are similar. Thus
