To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science
- 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities

This gives us a total of 100 professors. Given that the description is chosen at random from these 100, let's calculate the probability:

The prior probability (base rate) for being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{number\ of\ CS\ professors}{total\ number\ of\ professors} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability (base rate) for being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{number\ of\ H\ professors}{total\ number\ of\ professors} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We are asked to find \( P(CS | description) \).

Assuming the description does not provide specific information heavily indicating one field over the other, and all professors could reasonably be described similarly, we focus on the base rates.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately the same as the base rate:

\[ P(CS | description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So, the answer is:
