To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that 25 out of the 100 professors are from computer science, we can use the following approach:

First, we need to acknowledge that there is no specific information in Jason's description that clearly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we will assume the probabilities are evenly distributed based on the number of professors in each group.

The total number of professors is 100, with 25 of them being computer science professors, meaning there's a 25% or 0.25 probability that anyone chosen at random is a computer science professor.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
