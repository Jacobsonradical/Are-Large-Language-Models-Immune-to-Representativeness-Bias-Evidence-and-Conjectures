To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our probabilities based on new information. Here, we consider the following information:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We assume that the description given of Jason is equally likely for both the computer science and humanities professors (since no specific traits favor one group over the other in the description provided).

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description.

Given that there is no distinguishing information in the description to favor one group over the other, we assume \( P(B|A) \) is equal for both groups. Then, we only need to consider the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus:

\[ P(A
