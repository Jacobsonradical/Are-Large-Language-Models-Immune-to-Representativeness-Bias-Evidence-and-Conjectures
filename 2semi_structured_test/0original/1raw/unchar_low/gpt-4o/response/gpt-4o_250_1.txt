To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Number of computer science professors: 25
   - Number of humanities professors: 75

   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(Hum)) is:
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   We assume Jason's description does not provide significant distinguishable traits that favor one discipline over the other based on the provided details alone (i.e., "high ability," "strong motivation," "well-liked," and "positive reputation" are quite generic).

   Therefore, the probability of the description given he is from computer science (P(Description | CS)) and the probability of the description given he is from the humanities (P(Description | Hum)) are considered equal:
   \[
   P(Description | CS) \approx P(Description | Hum)
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we get:
