Given the numbers provided in the study, we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. We are given a description of one professor, Jason, and need to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor.

Assuming that the description does not provide any distinguishing information that would make Jason more likely to be from one group or the other, we can use the base rates to calculate the probability. 

The base rate for a computer science professor is:
\[ \text{Probability(computer science)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors is:
\[ \text{Probability} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
