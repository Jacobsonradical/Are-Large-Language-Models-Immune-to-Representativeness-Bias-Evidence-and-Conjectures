Given that Jason is described as having high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, these traits could be equally common in both computer science and humanities professors. Since the description doesn't provide specific information that would lean towards one academic discipline over the other, we should consider the base rates of the groups.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which makes the base rate for being a computer science professor 25% (or 0.25) and the base rate for being a humanities professor 75% (or 0.75).

Since there's no additional information in Jason's profile that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be given solely by the base rate.
