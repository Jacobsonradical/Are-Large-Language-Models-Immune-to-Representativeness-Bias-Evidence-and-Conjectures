Given the description, it's important to consider the base rates of the two groups of professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the total sample of 100 professors. 

Firstly, we use the base rate information, which is:
- Probability of a professor being from computer science: 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of a professor being from the humanities: 75/100 = 0.75

The description provided does not strongly favor one group over the other, therefore we rely on the base rate information.

Based on the base rates alone, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
