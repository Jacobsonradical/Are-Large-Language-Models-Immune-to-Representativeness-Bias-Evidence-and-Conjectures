To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. The calculation involves setting a prior probability and using the provided information to update it.

First, we need to define our prior probabilities:
- The total number of professors interviewed is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description given is relatively neutral and does not provide distinguishing characteristics that would favor one group over the other, we assume the likelihood of this description given a professor is in either group is roughly equal. Therefore, the likelihood does not affect our prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Given that the likelihoods are assumed to be equal for simplicity (i.e., \( P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum) \)), \( P(Description) \) can be considered as:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS
