Given the description, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without any other information, the initial, or "prior," probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description we have for Jason mentions he is high ability, strongly motivated, well-liked by colleagues, and enjoys a positive reputation. These traits are quite general and could apply to professors in any field. There is no specific information in the description that would suggest a greater likelihood of him being in one field over the other.

Given the lack of distinguishing information, we assume that the odds of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor reflect their proportions in the sample. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, remains the same as the prior probability.

So, the probability \( P(CS | \text{description}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{ P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) }
