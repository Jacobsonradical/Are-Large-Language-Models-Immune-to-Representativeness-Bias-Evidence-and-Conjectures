Given the information in the description, it is important to consider the base rate (prior probability) of Jason being in either the computer science or the humanities group before evaluating any additional specific information provided about Jason.

The base rate indicates that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) and the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Since the description does not provide any specific, distinguishing traits that are more characteristic of either computer science or humanities professors and matches both general profiles, we would rely heavily on these base rates.

Given the lack of additional evidence to sway our assessment, we can infer the probability that Jason is a computer science professor using these base rates:

{"probability": "0.25"}
