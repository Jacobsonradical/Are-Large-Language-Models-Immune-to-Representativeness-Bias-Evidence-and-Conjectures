Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is 0.25 (25 out of 100).

The description provided does not significantly differentiate between the two groups â€“ both groups can reasonably contain individuals with high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, and being well-liked by colleagues.

Thus, without additional distinguishing information, the probability remains the base rate.
