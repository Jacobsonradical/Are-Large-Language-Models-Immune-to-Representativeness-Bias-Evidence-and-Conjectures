Given the description of Jason, it is difficult to directly infer whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor based solely on the information provided about his personal characteristics and professional reputation. However, we can use the base rates of the two groups to make an educated guess.

Here are the base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

In the absence of additional information that differentiates between the two groups, we should rely on these base rates. The probability that a randomly chosen professor, given no other differentiating information, is from the computer science group is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
