To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor,
- \( D \): the description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given that we don't have any specific information about how the description might differ between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume the description is equally likely regardless of the field. Therefore, \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) can be considered equal.

However, we do have the base rates:
- The sample includes 25 computer science professors.
- The sample includes 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors in the sample is 100.

Hence, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given that the description doesn't favor either group specifically and assuming equal likelihood, we work with the base rates directly:

\[
