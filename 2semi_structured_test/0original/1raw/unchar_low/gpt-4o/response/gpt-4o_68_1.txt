To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. Here's the setup:

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) be the observation of Jason's description.

We are given:
- The total number of professors: \( P(A) = 25/100 \) for computer science and \( 1 - P(A) = 75/100 \) for humanities. 

Bayes' formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor
- \( P(\neg A) \): The probability he is a humanities professor
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Jason's description

Assuming that descriptions are similarly likely for computer science and humanities professors (due to lack of specific selection criteria based on provided personality), \( P(B|A) \) is approximately equal to \( P(B|\neg A) \).

If we assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), the equation simplifies based on priors
