Based on the information provided, the probability calculation involves the base rates of the given occupations and any distinguishing information from Jason's description. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the base rates are:

- P(CS professor) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given that Jason is described in a way that is not particularly unique to one field based on the provided description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked), we do not have specific evidence that would drastically change the base rates. Therefore, we will primarily rely on the base rates to estimate the probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
