To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the groups in the sample:

- Total number of professors in the study = 100
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75

Given that Jason's description lacks specific details that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we'll base our conclusion on the proportional representation of each group.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Therefore, the probability P is calculated as:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
