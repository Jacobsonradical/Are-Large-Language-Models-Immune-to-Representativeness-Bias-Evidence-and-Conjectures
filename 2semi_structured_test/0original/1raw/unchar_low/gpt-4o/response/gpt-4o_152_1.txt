Based on the information provided and considering only the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors), the probability can be calculated based on these proportions:

- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

The probability \( P(CS | Description) \) can be estimated by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors, since we lack specific information that conclusively points towards Jason being in one group or the other. Therefore,

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Here is the answer formatted as requested:

{"probability": "0.25"}
