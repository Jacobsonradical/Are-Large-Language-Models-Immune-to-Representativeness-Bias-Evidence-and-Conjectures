To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rate information and any specific information given in the description. 

The base rate tells us there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, giving us a prior probability.

P(Computer Science) = 25/100 = 0.25
P(Humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

The description given does not provide substantial differentiators that would strongly indicate Jason belongs to one group over the other solely based on his personal characteristics. Given the description is fairly general and characteristics like high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation could be applicable to successful academics in both fields, we don't have strong grounds to adjust the probabilities significantly.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the base rate probability:

{"probability": "0.25"}
