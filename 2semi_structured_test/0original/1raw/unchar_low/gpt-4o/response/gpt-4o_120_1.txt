To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. There are 25 computer science (CS) professors and 75 humanities professors.
2. Assume the probability of selecting any professor at random from the 100 professors is equal.

Let's define the probabilities:
- P(CS): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- P(Humanities): The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We are given a description of Jason, but without additional information or specific traits that are unique to either CS or humanities, we assume this description is equally likely for professors in both fields. Therefore, P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Humanities).

Since P(Description | CS) and P(Description | Humanities) are equal, they cancel each other out in Bayes' theorem when calculating the posterior probability.

Bayes' theorem in a simplified form for this context:
- P(CS | Description) = \(\frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}\)

Given P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Humanities), the calculation simplifies to using the base rates:

Therefore,
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0
