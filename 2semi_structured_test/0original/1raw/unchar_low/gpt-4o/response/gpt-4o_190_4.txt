Given that Jason is part of a sample consisting of both computer science and humanities professors, let's calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, consider the base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

Without any additional specific information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors in terms of personality traits (since Jasonâ€™s description could apply to either domain), we use the base rates to estimate the probability.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
