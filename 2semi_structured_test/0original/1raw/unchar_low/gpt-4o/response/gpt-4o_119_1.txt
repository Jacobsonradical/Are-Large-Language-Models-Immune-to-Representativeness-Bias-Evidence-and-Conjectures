To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and provides a way to update our belief based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\): The description of Jason

We are asked to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

We know:
- \(P(C)\): The prior probability that a professor is in computer science. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a professor is in the humanities. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

Given no other specific distinctions in the description that favor either computer science or humanities, we assume the likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are equal. Thus,
\[P(D|C) = P(D|H)\]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cd
