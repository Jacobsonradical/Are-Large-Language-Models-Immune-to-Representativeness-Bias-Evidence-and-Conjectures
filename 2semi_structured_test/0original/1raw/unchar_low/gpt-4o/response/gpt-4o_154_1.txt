Given the setup of the problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is 25 out of 100, or \( P(CS) = 0.25 \).
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is 75 out of 100, or \( P(Hum) = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description provided about Jason does not inherently favor either group (i.e., the description is equally likely to fit a computer science professor as a humanities professor), the likelihood of observing such a description for a professor selected from either discipline should be the same. Therefore, the conditional probabilities \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|Hum) \) should be equal.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
\]

\[
P(Hum|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(Desc)}
\]

Since \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|Hum) \) are equal and they are just conditional probabilities that
