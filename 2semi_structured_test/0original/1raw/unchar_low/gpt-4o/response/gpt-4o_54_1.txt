To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): The description fits Jason.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
     \[
     P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - \( P(A^c) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
     \[
     P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

3. **Assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \): There's no information suggesting that the description favors computer science or humanities professors. Therefore, we assume the likelihood of the description fitting either is equal. Let's denote this common likelihood as \( P(B) \).

Since the probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equal and the description itself doesn't favor any group disproportionately, the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(A^c) \) dictate our posterior probabilities.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cd
