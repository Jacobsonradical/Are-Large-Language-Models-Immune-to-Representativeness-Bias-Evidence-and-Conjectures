To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason fits the description provided.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the prior information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The complementary event \( P(A^C) \), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming the description is equally likely irrespective of the field (as no specific field-related traits were given in the description):
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \) should be considered equal.

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Without the specific values for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B
