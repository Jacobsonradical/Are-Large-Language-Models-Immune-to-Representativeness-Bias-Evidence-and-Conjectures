Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and based on the description provided, the priori likelihood (probability) of selecting Jason from either group seems equal without additional distinct information that separates the two groups. Ratios of professors in each field are our best basis for this probability estimate.

If there is no further information indicating a higher likelihood of Jason's traits being more common in one group over the other, we'd revert to the base proportions:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- Hence, the probability (P) that Jason is one of the computer science professors is: 

\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
