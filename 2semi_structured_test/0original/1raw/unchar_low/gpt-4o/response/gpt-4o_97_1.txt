Given that we have no additional information that specifically differentiates between the personality traits of computer science professors and humanities professors in this scenario, we would base our probability solely on the proportions provided in the sample. 

In the study, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Since a description is chosen at random and we don't have any distinguishing information, we assume a uniform distribution.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors, which is:

\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
