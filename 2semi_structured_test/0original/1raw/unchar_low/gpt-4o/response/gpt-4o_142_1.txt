The key issue here is to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description. This essentially requires using Bayes' theorem. However, in the absence of any information that explicitly differentiates the personality traits of computer science professors from those in the humanities, we need to rely on base rates (prior probabilities).

Here's the base rate calculation:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without additional distinguishing information, we cannot update this probability based on descriptive traits alone. Therefore, the probability remains as the base rate.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.25" \]
