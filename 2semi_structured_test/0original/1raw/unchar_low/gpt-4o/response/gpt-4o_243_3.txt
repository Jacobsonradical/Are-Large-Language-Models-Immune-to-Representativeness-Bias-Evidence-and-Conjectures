To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to consider both the base rates (the number of professors from each field) and any information provided about Jason's characteristics, if we assume that these characteristics are uniformly distributed across both fields (i.e., they don't favor either group).

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Given that there's no additional distinctive information that differentiates Jason as being more likely part of one group or the other based only on his personality traits, we rely on the base rates.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as follows:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability is:
