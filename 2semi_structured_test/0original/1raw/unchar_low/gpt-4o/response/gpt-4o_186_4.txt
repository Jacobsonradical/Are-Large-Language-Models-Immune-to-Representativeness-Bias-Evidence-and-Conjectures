Given the description of Jason and the sample sizes, we can use Bayes' theorem to help determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's state what we know:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor (CS) from the total pool of professors is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor (HU) from the total pool of professors is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we need to consider how likely it is that a computer science professor or a humanities professor would fit the given description, but since these details are neutral and quite generic (ability, motivation, likability), it might be reasonable to assume that such descriptions are equally probable for both groups.

Thus, if the description is equally likely to apply to a professor from either group, we can apply the base rates directly:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | HU) \), we can simplify:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HU)}
