Given the data that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample as follows.

We have no specific characteristics that differentiate Jason as a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Therefore, we will use the base rates (prior probabilities) for each group in our calculation.

The total number of professors is:
\[ 25 + 75 = 100 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \mathbf{{0.25}} \]

In the required format:
{"probability": "0.25"}
