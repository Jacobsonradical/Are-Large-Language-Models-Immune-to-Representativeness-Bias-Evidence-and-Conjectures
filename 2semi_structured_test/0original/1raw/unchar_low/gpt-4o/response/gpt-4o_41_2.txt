To determine the probability, I can apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem, which will help us update the probability based on the given description.

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability of randomly picking a computer science professor from the total pool of professors.
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
   - Prior probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is 25 out of 100, or \( P(CS) = 0.25 \).
   - Prior probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is 75 out of 100, or \( P(Hum) = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**: Since the description does not give enough specific traits that apply more to one group over the other (assuming for simplicity), we assume the given description has an equally likely chance of describing a professor from either group.
   - \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \).

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' Theorem to find the updated probability \( P(CS | D) \).

However, with equal likelihood and given the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \).

Since the description does not influence the likelihood more one way or the other, effectively, \(
