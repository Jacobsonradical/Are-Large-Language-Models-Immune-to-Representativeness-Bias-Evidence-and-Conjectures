To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a structured solution:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a professor is from the humanities is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   Here, the description of Jason does not provide specific evidence that strongly favors either group. Given the description is fairly neutral and could plausibly describe either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we can assume the likelihoods \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \) are similar.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | \text{description}) \) can be computed as:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
