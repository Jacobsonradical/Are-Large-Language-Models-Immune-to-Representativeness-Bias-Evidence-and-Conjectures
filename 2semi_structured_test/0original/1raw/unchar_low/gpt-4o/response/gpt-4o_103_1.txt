Explanation: The problem describes an equal likelihood scenario where we do not have specific indicators to differentiate between the two groups based on the given description. The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the base rates are 25% computer science and 75% humanities. Given no further differentiating details, we assume a proportional probability based on these base rates. Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
