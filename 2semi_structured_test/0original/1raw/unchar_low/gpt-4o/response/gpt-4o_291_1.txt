Given the sample of 100 professors, 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities. To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem and the information provided.

Since we are given no specific information that differentiates between the personality traits of computer science professors and humanities professors, we assume the description fits computer science and humanities professors equally well.

Therefore, we calculate the probability based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
