To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here is the relevant information:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of drawing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of drawing the description.

Since we are choosing the description at random and have no additional information distinguishing the descriptions of computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HU) \) are the same.

Therefore, using the prior probabilities alone:

\[ P(CS | D) = P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the
