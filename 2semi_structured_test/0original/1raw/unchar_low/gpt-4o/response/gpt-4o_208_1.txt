To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rate of computer science professors versus humanities professors in the sample. 

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total sample size of 100 professors

Using Bayes' theorem, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) of a professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25, and the prior probability \( P(H) \) of a professor being in the humanities is 75/100 = 0.75.

Although the description of Jason could apply to professors in both disciplines, without further distinguishing features and assuming that the description does not favor any field notably, we can apply these base rates directly.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
