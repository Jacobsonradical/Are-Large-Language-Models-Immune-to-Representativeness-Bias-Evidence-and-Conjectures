To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Given the general description of Jason, which doesn't strongly favor either group, we can use the base rates of the two groups in the sample.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making it 100 professors in total.

The prior probability (base rate) that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the provided description does not offer any specific evidence that favors either computer science or humanities professors, we assume that the likelihood of having such a description is equally probable for individuals in both groups. Therefore, the likelihood (\(P(Description|CS)\) and \(P(Description|H)\)) can be considered equal.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability (\(P(CS|Description)\)) would be:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since \(P(Description|CS)\) and \(P(Description|H)\) are equal, and considering \(P(Description)\) is based
