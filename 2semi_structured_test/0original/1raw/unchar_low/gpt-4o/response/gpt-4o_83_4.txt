Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, all randomly selected, the base probability (prior probability) of any randomly chosen professor being from the computer science group is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

This is based purely on the initial distribution.

The description provided does not contain any information that strongly indicates specific field-related traits; high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked and having a positive reputation are traits that could be common to successful academics in both fields. Hence, without any additional domain-specific information, the best estimate for the probability remains the initial base rate.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
