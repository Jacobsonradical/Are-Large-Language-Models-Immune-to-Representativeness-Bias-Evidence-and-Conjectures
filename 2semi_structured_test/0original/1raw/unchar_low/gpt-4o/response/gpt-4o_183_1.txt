Given the information provided, we know the following:

- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- In total, there are 100 professors (25 in computer science + 75 in the humanities).

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information distinguishing whether he is more likely to be in computer science or the humanities, we can use the base rates (i.e., the prior probabilities) of the two categories to determine the probability.

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Thus, given no additional distinguishing information, we would conclude:

{"probability": "0.25"}
