In order to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - What is the likelihood of the description matching a computer science professor versus a humanities professor? Given no additional information favoring one field over the other, we might assume the description is equally likely for both fields.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   According to Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor (0.25).
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description being observed, which takes into account both groups.

Given that the description doesn't favor either field over the other, \( P(B|A) \) for both computer science and humanities can be considered equal. Thus
