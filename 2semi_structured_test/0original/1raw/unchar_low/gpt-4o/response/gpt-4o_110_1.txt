Considering the given description and the proportions in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

Initially:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(\text{C}) \)): 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science, so \( P(\text{C}) = 0.25 \).
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(\text{H}) \)): 75 out of 100 professors are in humanities, so \( P(\text{H}) = 0.75 \).

Let's denote the event of the description matching (being high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, etc.) as \( D \). We seek \( P(\text{C} | D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{C} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(D)} \]

However, since we do not have the specific values for \( P(D | \text{C}) \) and \( P(D | \text{H}) \), we can simplify our reasoning based on the sample proportions:

Given the sample proportions, and if we assume the described traits are equally likely among professors in both fields:
\[ P(D | \text{C}) \approx P(D | \text{H}) \]

So, the prior probabilities \( P(\text{
