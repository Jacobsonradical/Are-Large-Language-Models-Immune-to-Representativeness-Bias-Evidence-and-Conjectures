To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to account for both the base rates (prior probabilities) of each group and the likelihood of the description given each group.

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): 75/100 = 0.75

Assuming the description of Jason provides no additional distinguishing information between the two groups (i.e., high ability and strong motivation are equally likely in both groups), we can use these prior probabilities directly.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.25"}
