Given that we don't have any specific trait or indicator in Jason's description that points distinctly to being either a computer science or a humanities professor, we can use the information about the composition of the sample for our probability estimate.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (before considering any specific personal information) would be the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[
\text{P(computer science)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Without any distinguishing details in Jason's description to update this probability, we should lean on this prior probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
