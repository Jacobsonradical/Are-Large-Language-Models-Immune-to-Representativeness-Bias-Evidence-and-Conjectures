Given that Jason's description lacks specific characteristics that clearly differentiate computer science professors from those in the humanities, we need to rely on the base rates provided in the study for our probability assessment.

Let's break down the information:

1. **Number of Computer Science Professors**: 25
2. **Number of Humanities Professors**: 75
3. **Total Number of Professors**: 100

Therefore, the base probability \(P(CS)\) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, without additional information increasing the likelihood of Jason being in one of the two categories, the best estimate is to use the base rates.

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
