Certainly! To determine the probability, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

However, we are given a description of Jason and asked to consider the probability in this context. Without additional specific information uniquely identifying characteristics more common to computer science or humanities professors, the base rate should be considered.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
