Given the description of Jason, we need to calculate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors.

First, we need to consider the base rates (priors) of the two groups:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason does not contain specific information that strongly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we rely on the base rates.

Given no additional distinguishing information, the updated probability \( P(CS | \text{description}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability \( P(CS) \).

Thus, the probability is:

\[ \{"probability": "0.25"\} \]
