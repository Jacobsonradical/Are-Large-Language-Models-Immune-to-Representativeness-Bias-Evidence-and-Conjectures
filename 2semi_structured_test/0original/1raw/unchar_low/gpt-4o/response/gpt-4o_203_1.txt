To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, it is essential to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability (Jason being a computer science professor) = \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability (Jason being a humanities professor) = \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason must be equally likely for professors in both computer science and humanities, assuming the description doesn't favor either discipline specifically.

3. **Normalization:**
   - The probability of picking Jason from any professor (regardless of the field) is the same as the sum of the conditional probabilities of Jason being from each field, multiplied by their respective priors.

Since the likelihood is equally probable for both computer science and humanities professors, the prior probabilities directly determine the posterior probability.

Therefore, the probability \( P(Jason \| CS) \) (probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description) can be given by:

\[ P(Jason \| CS) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability
