Given the total sample size of 100 professors, consisting of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we can calculate the prior probability that Jason comes from each group. Without any additional information, the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), and the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

The description provided does not contain specific information that could help differentiate clearly between the computer science and humanities professors, as traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues are likely common among successful academics in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the prior probability:

\( \text{Probability} = 0.25 \)

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
