To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem, which is written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 100 professors in total (25 from computer science and 75 from humanities).

Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

For simplicity, let's assume that the description of high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues does not substantially differentiate between the computer science and humanities professors (i.e., the description is equally likely for both fields). Thus:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Thus:

\[ P(B) = (P(B
