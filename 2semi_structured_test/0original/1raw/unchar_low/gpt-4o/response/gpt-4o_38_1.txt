To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, since the information provided about Jason doesnâ€™t give a significant clue to differentiate between these two groups.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- There are a total of 100 professors.

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information that would distinguish him as more likely to be one type of professor over the other, we'll base the probability purely on the proportions of the groups.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor out of the total sample is given by:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
