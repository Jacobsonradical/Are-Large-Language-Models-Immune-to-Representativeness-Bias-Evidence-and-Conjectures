To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description.

Given the description doesn't provide clear distinguishing features specific to either computer science or humanities professors, we can assume that the descriptions of motivation, high ability, and positive reputation are equally likely for both groups.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is:

   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \), is:
