To solve this problem, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description. 

First, let's note the given information:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors in the study.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors in the study.
- Therefore, the total number of professors in the study is 100.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Now, considering the equal treatment for each professorâ€™s description and no additional indication is given that professors in one field match the description more than those in the other:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors to the total professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that
