Given that we have two groups with different sizes, we need to consider the base rate or the prior probability of being from each group. We have 25 professors in computer science and 75 professors in humanities, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability of picking a professor from computer science is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability of picking a professor from humanities is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description provided does not contain specific information that would make someone clearly more likely to be in either group. Thus, the description does not significantly alter the base probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given no additional distinguishing information, remains proportional to the base rate of computer science professors.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
