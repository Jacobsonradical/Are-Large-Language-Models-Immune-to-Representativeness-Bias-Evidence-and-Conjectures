To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the problem statement, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description fitting a professor from either computer science or the humanities.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
   - There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability (before considering the description) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Based on the description alone, without additional information on how personality traits differ between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the described traits ("high ability and strong motivation," "well-liked by colleagues," "positive reputation") are equally likely to be found in both groups. This implies the likelihood is roughly the same for both.

Given this assumption, the likelihood ratio is effectively 1:1. Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description
