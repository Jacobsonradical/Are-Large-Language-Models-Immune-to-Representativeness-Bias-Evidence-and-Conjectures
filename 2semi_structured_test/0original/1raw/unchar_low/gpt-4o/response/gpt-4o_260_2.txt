{"probability": "0.25"}

The probability is calculated based on the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
