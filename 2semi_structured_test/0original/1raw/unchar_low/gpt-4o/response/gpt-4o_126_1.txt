The probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors is based on the proportions in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

To find the probability, we use the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
