To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have additional distinguishing information in Jason's description that indicates a higher likelihood of him being in one group over the other, we assume the likelihood of his traits is evenly distributed among all professors.

Thus, the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors given his description (P(CS|Description)) remains proportional to the base rate (prior probability):

\[ P(CS|Description) â‰ˆ P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.25 or 25%.
