Based on the information given, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description provided does not give us specific information to distinguish between the computer science and humanities professors directly based on their personality traits alone, so we have to rely on the given group sizes.

The total sample size is 100 professors:
- 25 are computer science professors.
- 75 are humanities professors.

Since Jason is selected randomly, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

{"probability": "0.25"}
