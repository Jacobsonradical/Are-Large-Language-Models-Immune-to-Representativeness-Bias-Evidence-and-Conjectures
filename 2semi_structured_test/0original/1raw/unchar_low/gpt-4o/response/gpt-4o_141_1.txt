Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, we can compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given prior information.

First, we calculate the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we calculate the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description given for Jason does not provide specific distinguishing features that favor one group over the other (i.e., it is equally likely to describe a successful professor from either field), we can assume that the probability of matching the description is independent of the field. Thus, we rely solely on the prior probabilities.

Given this, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be directly taken from the prior probability:
