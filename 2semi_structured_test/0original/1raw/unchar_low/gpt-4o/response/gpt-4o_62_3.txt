Given the information provided about the study, the base rates for each group (computer science and humanities professors) are crucial to determining the probability. 

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

In total, there are \( 25 + 75 = 100 \) professors.

Since the description of Jason does not provide discipline-specific clues and all 100 professors are tenured and successful, we use the base rates to determine the probability. The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Here is the answer in the required format:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
