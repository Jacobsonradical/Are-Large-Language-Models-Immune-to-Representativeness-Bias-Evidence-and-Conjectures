To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We already know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, forming our prior probabilities.

P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 (Probability he is a computer science professor)
P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 (Probability he is a humanities professor)

Given the description of Jason as highly capable, strongly motivated, and well-liked, we must consider that such qualities are common among both groups (as they are all successful academics), and there is no particular indication that one group is more likely to have these qualities than the other.

Without more specific information favoring computer science or humanities, we must assume that the observed traits have equal likelihood in both populations. Therefore, the likelihood ratios cancel out, and the probability remains proportional to the prior distribution of the groups.

Thus, the best estimate for this situation would be purely based on prior probability:

{"probability": "0.25"}
