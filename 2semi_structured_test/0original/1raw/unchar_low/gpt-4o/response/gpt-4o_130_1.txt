{"probability": "0.25"}

To calculate this probability, we use Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (P(A)) that a randomly chosen professor from this study is from the computer science group is 0.25 (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors). Without additional specific information about traits that differ significantly between computer science and humanities professors, the description of Jason does not provide enough evidence to alter the prior likelihood. Thus, the probability remains 0.25.
