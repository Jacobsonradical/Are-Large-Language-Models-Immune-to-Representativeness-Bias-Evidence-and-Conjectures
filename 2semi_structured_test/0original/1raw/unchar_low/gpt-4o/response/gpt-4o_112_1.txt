Given the scenario, we have:

- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- A total of 100 professors in the sample.

When trying to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given information, it's important to consider the base rates (proportion) of each group in the sample. Without additional information specifically differentiating personality traits or other distinct characteristics between the two groups, we fall back on these proportions:

- The probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly from the given sample is 25 out of 100.
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly from the given sample is 75 out of 100.

To calculate the probability:

\[
P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, given only the description provided and no additional distinguishing details, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
