Let's approach this by considering the initial proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study.

Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities.

To find the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
- Probability (Computer Science) = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- Probability (Humanities) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason as a highly able, strongly motivated, and well-liked person does not provide specific information that differentiates between the two groups based on given personality traits. Therefore, no additional information will lead us to adjust the initial probabilities based on the description provided.

Given this reasoning, the prior probabilities remain unchanged.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
