Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

First, let's consider the base rates provided: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors in the sample.

The prior probability that Jason belongs to either group is:
- Probability of being a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description of Jason, who is characterized by high ability, strong motivation, and a positive reputation among colleagues (which are likely common traits among successful academics in both disciplines), there is insufficient specific information to significantly alter these base rates.

Therefore, without further distinguishing information, we rely on the base rates to estimate the probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated directly from the prior:

{"probability": "0.25"}
