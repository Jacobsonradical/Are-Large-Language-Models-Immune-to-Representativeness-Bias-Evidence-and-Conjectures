To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. 

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. The total number of professors is 100.

We apply Bayes' theorem and use the base rate of professors in each field:

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The problem does not provide any additional information that differentiates Jason as a computer science professor or a humanities professor beyond the general description provided. Hence, we rely solely on the base rates:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Since we only have the description and no special distinguishing information, we assume the probability remains the same as the base rate:

\[ P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
