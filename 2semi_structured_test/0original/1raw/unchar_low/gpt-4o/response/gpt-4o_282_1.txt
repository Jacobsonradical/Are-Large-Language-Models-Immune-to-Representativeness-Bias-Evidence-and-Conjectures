Given the information at hand, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups of professors involved: computer science (CS) professors and humanities professors. 

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The only information we have about Jason doesn't differentiate between traits that are exclusive to computer science or humanities professors. Thus, we should base our probability estimate primarily on the proportion of each group in the total sample:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since Jason could be equally likely to have come from either group, given that there's nothing in the description that specifically favors one group over the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be:

\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
