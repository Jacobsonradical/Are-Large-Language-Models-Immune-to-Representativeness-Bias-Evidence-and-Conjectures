To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.

   Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

2. **Probability of choosing a computer science professor at random (\(P(CS)\)):**
   \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Probability of choosing a humanities professor at random (\(P(H)\)):**
   \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description of Jason does not provide any specific characteristics that would differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we will assume that the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in either group is equally probable.

Given this symmetry in the assumption of equal likelihood of the description fitting each professor, the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors should be directly proportional to the prior probability of randomly picking a computer science professor.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \) and \( P(\text
