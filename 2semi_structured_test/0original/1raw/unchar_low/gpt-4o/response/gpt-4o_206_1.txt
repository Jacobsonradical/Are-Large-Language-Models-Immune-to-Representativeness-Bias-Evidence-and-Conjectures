To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, let's start by using Bayes' theorem and some basic probability principles.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 25 (computer science) + 75 (humanities) = 100.
- The description of Jason does not provide specific indicators that clearly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors based on the given details.

We'll assume the description is equally likely to apply to anyone in the sample. Therefore, we can base our probability calculation on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Therefore, the probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25. \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
