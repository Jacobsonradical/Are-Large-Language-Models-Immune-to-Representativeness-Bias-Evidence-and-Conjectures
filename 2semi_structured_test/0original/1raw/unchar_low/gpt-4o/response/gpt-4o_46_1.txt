To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's summarize the given information:

- There are 100 professors in total: 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities.
- Jason is chosen randomly from these 100 professors.

We need to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description of his personality traits.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description of his personality traits.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Since Jason is randomly chosen from the 100 professors:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming the description does not favor either group more than the inherent distribution:
