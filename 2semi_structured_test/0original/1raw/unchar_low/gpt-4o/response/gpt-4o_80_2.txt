Given the description of Jason and knowing the distribution of the sample (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors), we can use Bayes' theorem to help determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The event that Jason is the person described.

We seek \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jasonâ€™s description being chosen at random.

However, in the absence of additional specific descriptions differentiating computer science and humanities professors, we can assume that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) (where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor) are roughly equal for both groups because no distinct traits have been listed for one group over the other.

Thus, \( P(B) \) is a
