Based on the given information, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

Here's what we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

Since the description does not provide any distinguishing features specific to either field, we assume each professor has an equal likelihood of being chosen. Therefore, the probability can be calculated by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The probability \( P \) is given by:
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
