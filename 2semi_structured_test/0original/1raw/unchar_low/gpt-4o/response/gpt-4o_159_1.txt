To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description matches Jason.

We are given that the description matches Jason, so we need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we know:
- \( P(A) = P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = P(\text{Jason is a humanities professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming the description does not give any distinguishing feature to favor one group over another, the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) would be approximately the same (since the description does not mention any specific traits favoring one department over another).

Thus, we can use the base rates directly:
\[ P(B|
