Given that Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, and there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

The base probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the base probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description of Jason does not provide specific details that would categorize him exclusively as a computer science or humanities professor, we assume the description is equally likely to describe individuals from either group. This suggests there is no additional information to adjust the base probabilities.

Therefore, the probability \( P(CS|Description) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is the same as the base probability:
\[ P(CS|Description) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
