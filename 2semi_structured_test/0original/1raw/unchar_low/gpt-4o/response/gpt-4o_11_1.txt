To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we first need to consider the proportion of computer science professors among the total professors in the study.

There are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Total of 100 professors

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor purely based on the numbers of professors is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description does not provide any specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors. Thus, we base the probability solely on the proportion of the two groups.

Given this, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
