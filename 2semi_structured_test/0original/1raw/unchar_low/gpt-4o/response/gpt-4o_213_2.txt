Given the information, we first need to consider base rates (the relative proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample) and how representative this description is of each group.

From the problem:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

This means the prior probability (base rate) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason doesn't strongly indicate any field-specific characteristics. He is highly able and motivated, well-liked by colleagues, and has a positive professional reputation. These traits could easily apply to both groups. Given this lack of specific information, we stick closer to the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be best estimated based on the base rate.

\[ P(CS | Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
