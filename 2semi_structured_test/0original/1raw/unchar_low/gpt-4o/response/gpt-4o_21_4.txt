To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( CS \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) : Description given (Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children, known for his high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by his colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation).

We start with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors total)

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To solve this, we need to find \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). However, since the description is quite generic and does not provide specific information strongly favoring either discipline, we can assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \)

Given this, we can simplify Bayes' theorem for our purposes:
\[ P(C
