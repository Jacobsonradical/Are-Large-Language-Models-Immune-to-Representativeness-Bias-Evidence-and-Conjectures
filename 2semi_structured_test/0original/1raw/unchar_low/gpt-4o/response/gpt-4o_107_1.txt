Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem to assess the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based on the description provided.

Since the description of Jason seems fairly general and could apply equally to both groups of professors, we have no reason to believe that computer science professors specifically would be more likely to fit this description compared to humanities professors. 

Therefore, the probability is proportional to the number of professors in each discipline within the sample. 

\[ \text{Prior Probability of Computer Science Professor} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, based on the given information and assuming the description is not biased towards either group:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
