Based on the given information, there are 100 professors in the study, with 25 being from computer science and 75 from the humanities. We do not have any specific information that discriminates between the two groups in the description provided. Thus, we can use the base rates to determine the probability.

The probability \(P(CS)\) of Jason being a computer science professor, given no additional information, can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
