To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The base rate for computer science professors is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate for humanities professors is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description does not provide specific details distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors, we should rely on these base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
