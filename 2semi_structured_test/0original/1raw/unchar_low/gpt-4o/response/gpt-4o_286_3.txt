Given the provided information, we have a total of 100 professors: 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities. 

This implies that the prior probability of any given professor being from the computer science group is:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Similarly, the prior probability of any given professor being from the humanities group is:

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

The description provided about Jason gives general traits such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked. These traits are common and don't particularly favor one group over the other. Without additional specific information that could distinctly indicate a higher likelihood of belonging to the computer science group rather than the humanities group, we rely on the base rates.

Since there's no additional information to adjust these probabilities from the base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.25
\]

So the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
