Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{Base Rate Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided does not contain any specific information that differentiates between the fields of computer science and humanities. Hence, we rely solely on the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
