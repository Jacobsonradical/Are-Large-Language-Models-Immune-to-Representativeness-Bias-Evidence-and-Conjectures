Based on the information provided, we know that out of the 100 professors in the study, 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities. The provided description does not include any specific information that strongly differentiates between the fields of computer science and the humanities. Therefore, we have no reason to favor one group over the other based on the given description.

Using Bayes' theorem and prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given that the description does not provide any additional information that would alter these probabilities, the probability remains the same as the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
