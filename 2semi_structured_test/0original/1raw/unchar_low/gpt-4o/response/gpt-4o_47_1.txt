To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

We are given the following information:
- We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We are given a description of one professor chosen at random from the 100 total professors.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability of a professor being in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of a professor being in the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the given description matching a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of the given description matching a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the probability of the given description.

We start with:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we assume that the description could equally describe a professor in either field (based on the given information, as we have no reason to believe otherwise):
- \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \)

Given this equivalence and because \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups ('matching' a randomly chosen professor is
