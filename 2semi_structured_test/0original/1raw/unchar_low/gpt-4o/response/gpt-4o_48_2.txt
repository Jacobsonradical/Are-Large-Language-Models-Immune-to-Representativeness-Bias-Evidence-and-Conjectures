Given the information about Jason, and considering the number of professors in each group, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, we have the following information:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Let's assume that the description given is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor, since there is no specific information strongly indicating either field.

The a priori probabilities are:
- P(CS) = Probability of being a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Hum) = Probability of being a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

With no additional specific information to differentiate between the two groups based on the given description (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation â€“ qualities that can be equally present in both fields), the description doesn't change the relative likelihood ascribed to either group. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains at the a priori probability:

{"probability": "0.25"}
