{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Assuming that each professor has an equal likelihood of being randomly selected for the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
