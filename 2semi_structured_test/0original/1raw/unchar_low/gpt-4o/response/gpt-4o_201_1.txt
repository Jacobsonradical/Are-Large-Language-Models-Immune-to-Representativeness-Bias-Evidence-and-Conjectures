Given the information provided, we have a total sample of 100 professors, with 25 of them being computer science professors and 75 being humanities professors. Without additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, we can only rely on the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample to estimate the probability.

Let's define the following:
- P(CS) as the probability of a professor being in computer science.
- P(Hum) as the probability of a professor being in the humanities.

From the information:
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given we have no other distinguishing information in Jason's description that points specifically to computer science or humanities, we will use the base rates to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}
