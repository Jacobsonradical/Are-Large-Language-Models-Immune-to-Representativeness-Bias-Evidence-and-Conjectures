To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the following formula:
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
