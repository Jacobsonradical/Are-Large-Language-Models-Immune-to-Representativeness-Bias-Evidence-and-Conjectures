Given the description provided, it does not contain specific information that distinguishes between computer science professors and humanities professors. Therefore, we need to rely on the base rates provided in the study.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the base rate proportion:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

So, given the information and the base rates:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
