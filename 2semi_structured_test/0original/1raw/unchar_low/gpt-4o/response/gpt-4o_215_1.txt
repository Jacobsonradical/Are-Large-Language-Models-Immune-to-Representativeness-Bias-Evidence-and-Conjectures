Given the description of Jason, we need to use the information from the study to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor.

First, let's summarize the data:
- There are 100 professors in total.
- 25 of them are computer science professors.
- 75 of them are humanities professors.

The basic probability that Jason is a computer science professor, without any other information, is calculated by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided does not give us any specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing information, we use the base rate provided by the proportion.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25 \]

Answer:

{"probability": "0.25"}
