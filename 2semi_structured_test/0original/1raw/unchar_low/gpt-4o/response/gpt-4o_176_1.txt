Given the information provided, we know that there are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. Since we do not have any specific information in the description that strongly distinguishes Jason as likely belonging to one group over the other, we can use the base rate (the prior probability) to estimate.

The base rate for Jason being a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

So, the base rate probability is:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
