Given the description, it's important to first consider the base rates or prior probabilities associated with each group. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making the probability that Jason is a humanities professor significantly higher by simple number ratio.

Without any other distinguishing traits strongly associated with either group, a Bayesian approach can be used to calculate the conditional probability. Starting with the base rates:

- Probability Jason is a CS professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Since the description does not provide strong evidence to differentiate between CS and humanities professors (traits like 'high ability,' 'strong motivation,' and being 'well-liked' seem common across successful individuals in both groups), we'll rely mainly on the base rates.

Given that there's no additional evidence to favor one group over the other, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
