Given the information presented, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

We know:
- P(CS): Probability that a professor is in computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities): Probability that a professor is in the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

We need to find P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Unfortunately, the description provided does not include specific traits that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, making it a challenge to directly apply Bayesian updating beyond base rates.

Given that the description does not favor one group over the other, we can rely on the base rates provided by the sample sizes.

Using the total probability rule:
P(Description) = P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) * P(Humanities)

Assuming the description applies equally well to professors in both groups (as we are not given any reason to believe otherwise):
P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Humanities)

Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
P(CS | Description) = P(CS)

Accordingly, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate:
0.25

Hence, our answer would be:

{"probability": "0.25"}
