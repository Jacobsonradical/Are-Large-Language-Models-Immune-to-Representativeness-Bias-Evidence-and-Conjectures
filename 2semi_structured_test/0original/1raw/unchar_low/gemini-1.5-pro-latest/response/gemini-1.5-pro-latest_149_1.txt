{"probability": "0.25"}

Here's why:

* **Prior Probability:** There's a baseline chance that Jason is a computer science professor simply because 25% of the sample (25 out of 100) are in that field.
* **The Description is Generic:** The provided description offers no information that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science vs. humanities. It describes positive traits found in many successful professionals, regardless of their field.

Since we have no information to shift away from the baseline, the probability remains the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.
