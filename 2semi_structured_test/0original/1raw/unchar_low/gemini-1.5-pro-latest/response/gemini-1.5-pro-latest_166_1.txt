It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description focuses on common traits that could apply to professors in any field. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:**  30 years old and married with no children doesn't strongly indicate either computer science or humanities. 
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are desirable in any academic field.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  Again, positive personal qualities don't differentiate between disciplines.

**Since the description offers no clues about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests, we have to rely on the base rates provided in the study:**

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
