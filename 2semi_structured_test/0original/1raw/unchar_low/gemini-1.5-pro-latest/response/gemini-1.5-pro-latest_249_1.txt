It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The personality traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The description lacks specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest an inclination towards a specific academic discipline.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as his being in the humanities, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability is calculated as 25/100 = 0.25.
