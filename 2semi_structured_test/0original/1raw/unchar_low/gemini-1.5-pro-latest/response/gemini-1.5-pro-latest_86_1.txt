It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies equally to professors in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Irrelevant Information:**  The description focuses on general traits that don't strongly indicate a specific field.  

**Important Note:** Stereotyping based on limited information is unreliable and can lead to biased judgments.
