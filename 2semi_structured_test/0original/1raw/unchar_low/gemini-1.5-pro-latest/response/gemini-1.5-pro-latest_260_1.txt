It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could easily apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that would hint at his academic discipline.
* **Bias alert:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be well-liked or that humanities professors are less likely to be married would be a baseless stereotype.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
