It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:**  There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that would hint towards computer science or humanities.
* **Base rate bias:** We know there's a higher base rate of humanities professors in the study (75%) compared to computer science (25%). 

**Therefore, without any field-specific information, the probability is influenced solely by the base rate.**

{"probability": "0.25"}

This reflects the 25% chance that any randomly chosen professor from this study would be from the computer science group.
