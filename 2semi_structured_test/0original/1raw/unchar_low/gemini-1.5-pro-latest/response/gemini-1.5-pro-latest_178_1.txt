It is impossible to determine with any accuracy whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor based solely on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  The description relies on very general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields.  It uses stereotypical ideas about  "high ability" and "strong motivation" being linked to success in academia.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** There is nothing in the description that is particularly associated with computer science or the humanities. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some subtle differences in the descriptions, a sample size of 100 is relatively small for drawing conclusions about entire fields.

**Therefore, any probability I provide would be a guess and not based on any meaningful evidence from the description.**
