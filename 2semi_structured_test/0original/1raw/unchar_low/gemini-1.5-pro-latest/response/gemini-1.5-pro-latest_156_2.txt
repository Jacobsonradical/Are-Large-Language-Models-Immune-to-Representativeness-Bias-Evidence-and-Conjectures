It is impossible to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description focuses on positive personality traits common in many professions, not just academia, and doesn't offer any specific clues about Jason's field of study.
* **Base rate bias:** We tend to ignore base rates (the proportion of computer science professors vs. humanities professors in the sample) when presented with individual information. There's a higher base rate of humanities professors (75%) in the study than computer science professors (25%). 

**To estimate the probability, we would need more information that is specifically relevant to differentiating between computer science and humanities professors.** 

**Therefore, any probability provided would be a guess and not based on the information given.**
