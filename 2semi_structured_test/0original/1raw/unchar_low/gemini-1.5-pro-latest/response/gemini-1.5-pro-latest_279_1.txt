It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that would hint at his specialization.

Therefore, any probability I assign would be a random guess.  

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"}
