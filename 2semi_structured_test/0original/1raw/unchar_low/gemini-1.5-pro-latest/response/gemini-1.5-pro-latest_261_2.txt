It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. These traits can be found in individuals across all professions.
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful individual in many fields, not just academia. 
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** While the original study included more humanities professors, knowing the overall sample composition doesn't give us information about an individual randomly chosen from that group.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to computer science specifically, the probability is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**
