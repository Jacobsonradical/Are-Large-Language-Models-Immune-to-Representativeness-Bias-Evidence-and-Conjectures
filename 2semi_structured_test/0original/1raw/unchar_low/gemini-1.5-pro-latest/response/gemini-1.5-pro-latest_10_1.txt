{
"probability": "0.25"
}
```

**Explanation:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's field of study. Therefore, the only information relevant to determining the probability is the composition of the sample:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25/100 = 25% of the sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75/100 = 75% of the sample.

Since we have no other information about Jason, there is a 25% chance he belongs to the computer science group.
