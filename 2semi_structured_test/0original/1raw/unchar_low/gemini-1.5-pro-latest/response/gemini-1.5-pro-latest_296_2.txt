It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It lists positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other clues that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability is:

```
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
