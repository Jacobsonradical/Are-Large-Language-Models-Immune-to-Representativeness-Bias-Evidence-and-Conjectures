It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. The description focuses on general personality traits and demographics that are not particularly indicative of either computer science or humanities disciplines. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

This is because there's a 25% chance he's one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
