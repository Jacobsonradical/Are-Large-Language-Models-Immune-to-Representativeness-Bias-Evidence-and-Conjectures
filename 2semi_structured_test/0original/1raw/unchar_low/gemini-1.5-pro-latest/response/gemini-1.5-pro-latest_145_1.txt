It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common across professions. It doesn't mention anything specific to computer science or humanities.
* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer scientists are more likely to be named "Jason," or that humanities professors are less likely to be married with children, would be based on harmful stereotypes.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to either field, the probability is equal to the base rate in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The study included 25 computer science professors out of 100 total.
* This means there's a 25% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
