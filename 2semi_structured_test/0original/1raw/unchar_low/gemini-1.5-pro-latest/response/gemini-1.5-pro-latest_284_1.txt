It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on harmful stereotypes.  Personality traits and demographics don't reliably predict career fields.
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw conclusions about entire professions. 
* **Lack of comparative information:**  The description doesn't tell us how Jason's traits compare to the other professors in the study. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the study: 25/100.**
