It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, married without children, highly motivated, or well-liked is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence.  
* **Limited Information:** The description offers generic positive attributes applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just academia. 
* **Sample Bias:**  The study itself has a skewed sample with 75% humanities professors. However, this information alone is not helpful in determining Jason's field without further analysis.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.
