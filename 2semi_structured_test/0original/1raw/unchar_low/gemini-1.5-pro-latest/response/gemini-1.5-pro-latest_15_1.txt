It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:**  It focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in various fields. 
* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming a profession based on limited information reinforces biases and doesn't reflect the diversity within academic disciplines.

Therefore, without further information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group. Since there's a 25/100 chance he's in computer science, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
