It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that might hint at his field.
* **The sample size is skewed:**  The study has 3 times as many humanities professors as computer science professors.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
