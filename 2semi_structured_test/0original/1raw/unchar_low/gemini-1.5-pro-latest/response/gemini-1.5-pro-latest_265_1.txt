It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could be equally applicable to professors in computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the overall sample. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Total computer science professors:** 25
* **Total professors in the sample:** 100
* **Probability:** 25/100 = 0.25

**Answer:**

```json
