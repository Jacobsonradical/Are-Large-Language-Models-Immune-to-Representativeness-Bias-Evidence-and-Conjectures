It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is based on the initial sample composition:

* 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25

{"probability": "0.25"}
