It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The information given focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common to successful academics in various fields.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is a harmful generalization. 
* **Description lacks specifics:**  The description lacks any details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor simply because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study belong to that field.
