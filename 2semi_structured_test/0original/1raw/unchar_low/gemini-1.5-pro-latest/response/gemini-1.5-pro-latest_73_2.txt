It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful conclusions.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Important Note:** This assumes the description was chosen randomly. If you were intentionally given a description designed to be ambiguous or misleading, the probability could be different.
