It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights personal attributes and professional standing, which could apply to professors in both computer science and the humanities.  Therefore, the probability is equal for both.

Here's how to approach it logically:

* **Base Rate:**  Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, meaning there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Description:** The description provides no information that would make it more or less likely that Jason is in computer science. 

Since we have no additional information, we stick with the base rate.

{"probability": "0.25"}
