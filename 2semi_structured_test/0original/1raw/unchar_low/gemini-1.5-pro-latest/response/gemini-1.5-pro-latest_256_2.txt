It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:** The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some personality traits more common in one profession, a sample size of 25 is too small to draw reliable conclusions.
* **Lack of comparative information:**  The description doesn't tell us how these traits compare to the general population or to professors in the humanities group.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate given in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
