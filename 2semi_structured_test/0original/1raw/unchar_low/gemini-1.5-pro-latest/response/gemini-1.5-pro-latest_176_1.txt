It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given is stereotypical and doesn't offer any real insight into whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities.

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While some might associate traits like "high ability" and "strong motivation" more with STEM fields, these are valuable in any academic discipline. 
* **The description is vague:** It lacks specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or even hobbies that might hint at his field.
* **Base rates matter:** The study included 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors.  This means a randomly chosen professor is three times more likely to be from the humanities.

Therefore, without any evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be in computer science, the probability should be based on the base rate.
