It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given - age, marital status, personality traits - applies equally to professors in computer science and the humanities.  

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 or 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science vs. humanities.  

**Important Note:**  Stereotyping based on limited information is unreliable and potentially biased.
