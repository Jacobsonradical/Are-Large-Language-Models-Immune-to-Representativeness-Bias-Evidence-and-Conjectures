It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. There's nothing specifically suggesting an inclination towards either field.
* **Base rate bias:** We tend to ignore the base rate (prior probability) when given individual information.  There are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. Even if the description slightly pointed towards computer science, the higher base rate for humanities would still make it more likely Jason is in that field.

**To get a meaningful probability, we would need more information that distinguishes between the fields, such as:**

* Jason's research interests
* Hobbies
* Teaching style
* Other personality traits more common in one field over the other 

**Therefore:**

{"probability": "Cannot be determined from the information provided"}
