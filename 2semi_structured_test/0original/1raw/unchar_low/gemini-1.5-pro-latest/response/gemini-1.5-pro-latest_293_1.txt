It's impossible to determine a probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The provided description lacks any specific details about Jason's research interests, hobbies, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field of study. 
* **The sample sizes are skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. This alone makes it statistically more likely that Jason is in the humanities.

**To give you a meaningful probability, we would need more information that could potentially correlate with either field, such as:**

*  Specific research areas
*  Teaching methodologies
*  Hobbies or interests outside of work 
*  Personality traits more unique to certain fields

**Therefore, without further information, any probability estimate would be pure speculation.**
