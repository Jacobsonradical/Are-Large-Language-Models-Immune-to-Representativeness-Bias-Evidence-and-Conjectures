It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:** The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances applicable to professionals in various fields. 
* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming a profession based on limited information can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about different academic disciplines.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
