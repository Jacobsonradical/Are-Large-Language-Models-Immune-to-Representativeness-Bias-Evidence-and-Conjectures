I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in any field, not just computer science or humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his area of expertise.
* **The sample sizes are irrelevant:** Knowing that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors doesn't help us determine the probability of *this specific description* belonging to a computer science professor. 

To calculate a meaningful probability, you would need more information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors within the study's findings.
