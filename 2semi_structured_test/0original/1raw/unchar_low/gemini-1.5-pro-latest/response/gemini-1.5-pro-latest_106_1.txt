It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies equally to professionals in various fields, including both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability is calculated as 25/100 = 0.25
