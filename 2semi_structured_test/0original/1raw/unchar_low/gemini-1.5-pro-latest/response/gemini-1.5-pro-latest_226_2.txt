{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It mentions traits common to successful academics in general (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation).  Therefore, without any information to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other, we stick with the base rate probability of 0.25.
