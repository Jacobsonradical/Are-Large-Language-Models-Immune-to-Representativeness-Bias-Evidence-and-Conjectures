It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are desirable qualities in many professions, not just computer science or academia. 
* **No relevant information:**  The description lacks any information that would hint at Jason's field of study, interests, or work habits.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**
