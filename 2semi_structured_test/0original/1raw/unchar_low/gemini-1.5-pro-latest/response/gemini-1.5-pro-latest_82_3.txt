{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that Jason is a computer science professor.  

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. Therefore, we rely solely on the base rates provided in the study's sample.
