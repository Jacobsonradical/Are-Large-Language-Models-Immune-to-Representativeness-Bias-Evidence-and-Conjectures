I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no stereotypes or specific traits mentioned that would make one field more likely than the other. 
* **Base rate is crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. Since there were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study, it's initially more likely that Jason is in the humanities. 

**To get a more accurate probability, you would need more information that could potentially distinguish between the two groups of professors.**
