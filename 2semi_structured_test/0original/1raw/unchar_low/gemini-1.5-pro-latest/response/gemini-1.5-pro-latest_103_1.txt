It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** The study includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors.  

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

**Important Note:** This assumes a 50/50 chance since no field-specific information is given. It does not reflect a true probability based on the description.
