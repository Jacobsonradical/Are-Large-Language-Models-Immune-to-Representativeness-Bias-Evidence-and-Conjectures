It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in various fields, not just computer science. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** The study includes 3 times more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25). This means even if we assume all other factors are equal, there's a higher baseline chance of Jason being in the humanities.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}
