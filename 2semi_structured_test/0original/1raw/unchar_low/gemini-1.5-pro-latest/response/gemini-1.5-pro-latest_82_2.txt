It is impossible to determine a reasonable probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The provided description lacks any specific traits commonly associated with either computer science or humanities professors.  
* **Small sample size and potential bias:** Even if there were some subtle hints, a sample size of 25 for computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population of computer science professors. 
* **No comparative information:**  We have no information about the personality descriptions of other professors in the study, making it impossible to assess if Jason's description is more aligned with computer science or humanities professors. 

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the provided information.**
