It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  It highlights general positive traits (high ability, motivation, good reputation) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, without further information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

While I cannot provide a meaningful probability, it's important to note that simply guessing based on stereotypes (e.g., assuming a young, analytical person is more likely in computer science) is not a reliable approach.
