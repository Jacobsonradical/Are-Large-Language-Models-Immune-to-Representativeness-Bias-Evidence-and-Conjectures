It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Since there's no information to differentiate Jason's field, and the sample had 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the probability is simply the base rate:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
