It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  married without children, or possess high ability and strong motivation is based on harmful stereotypes.  
* **Lack of Information:** The description provides no information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other factor that might hint at his field.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some statistically significant differences between the personality traits of computer science and humanities professors (which is debatable), a sample size of 25 for computer science professors is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**
