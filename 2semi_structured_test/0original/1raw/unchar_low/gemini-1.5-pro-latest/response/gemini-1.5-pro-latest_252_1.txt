It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:**  There's nothing in the description about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other clues that might hint at his field of study.
* **The sample is biased:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly selected description is more likely to belong to a humanities professor.

**Therefore, without further information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

While I cannot give you a probability, I can tell you the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor based purely on the sample sizes is 0.25 (25 computer science professors / 100 total professors). 

**However, this prior probability is likely irrelevant** given the generic description.
