It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to successful professors in many disciplines, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**  

To provide a meaningful probability, we would need more information in the description that is specifically relevant to the differences between computer science and humanities professors.
