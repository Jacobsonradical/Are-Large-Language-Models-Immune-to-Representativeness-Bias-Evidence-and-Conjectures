It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. The description highlights personality traits and demographics that could be found in professors from various disciplines. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are not exclusive to computer science professors. Humanities professors can possess these traits too.
* **Demographics:**  Being a 30-year-old married man without children doesn't offer any specific clues about Jason's academic field.

Since we have no information about Jason's research, teaching interests, or other field-specific indicators, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical probability.
