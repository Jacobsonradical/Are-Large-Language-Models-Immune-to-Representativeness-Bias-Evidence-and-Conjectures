It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other clue that would link him to either computer science or humanities.

**Therefore, given the information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his being from the larger group of professors.**

Since there were 25 computer science professors out of 100 total:
