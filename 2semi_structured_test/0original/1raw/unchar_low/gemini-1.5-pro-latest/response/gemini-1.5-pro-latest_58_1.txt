It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, married without children, highly motivated, or well-liked is based on stereotypes and not factual evidence. 
* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description doesn't mention anything about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might be more indicative of his field.

**Therefore, given the information provided, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being in the humanities, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** There's a 25% (25 out of 100) chance Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the sample composition.
