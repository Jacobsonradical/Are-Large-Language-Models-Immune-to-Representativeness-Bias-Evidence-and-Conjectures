It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professionals in both computer science and humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be married or have different personality traits is based on harmful stereotypes. 
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were some subtle statistical differences between the fields, a sample size of 25 for computer science is too small to draw conclusions from.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being in the humanities, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:**
