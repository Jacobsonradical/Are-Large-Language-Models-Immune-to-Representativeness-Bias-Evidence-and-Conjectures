It's impossible to determine a useful probability based on the given description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** It lacks any information that would be particularly indicative of someone in computer science or humanities.  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are desirable traits in many professions.
* **We lack prior information:**  We don't know the general prevalence of these personality traits within either field. Even if the description was slightly more suggestive of one field, without baseline data, we can't make an informed judgment.
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size, which further limits the ability to draw strong conclusions.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

While it's tempting to try and guess, it's important to recognize when we don't have enough information to make a reasonable inference.
