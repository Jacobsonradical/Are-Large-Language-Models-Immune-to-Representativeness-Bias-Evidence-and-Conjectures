It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common to successful professionals in many fields. 
* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, young, or childless is based on harmful stereotypes. Success in academia cuts across gender, age, and family status.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

There is a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
