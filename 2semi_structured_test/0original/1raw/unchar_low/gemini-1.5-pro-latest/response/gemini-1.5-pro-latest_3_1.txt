It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:**  There's nothing about Jason's research interests, hobbies, or other factors that might hint at his academic background.
* **Base rate:** While there were fewer computer science professors in the study (25 vs. 75), this doesn't directly translate to Jason's individual probability.

**Therefore, without any information linking the provided characteristics to a higher likelihood of being in computer science, the probability is based purely on chance.**

{"probability": "0.5"}

**Important Note:** This assumes a 50/50 probability since we lack the necessary information to make an informed judgment.
