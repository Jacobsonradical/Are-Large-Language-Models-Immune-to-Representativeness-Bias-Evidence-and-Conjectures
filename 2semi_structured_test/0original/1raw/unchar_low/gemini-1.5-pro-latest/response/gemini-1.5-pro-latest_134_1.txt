{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor.

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study.  Therefore, we rely solely on the base rates from the sample.
