It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies to successful professionals in many fields, not just computer science. 

Since 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science, the baseline probability is 0.25. However, the description offers no information to adjust this probability. 

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
