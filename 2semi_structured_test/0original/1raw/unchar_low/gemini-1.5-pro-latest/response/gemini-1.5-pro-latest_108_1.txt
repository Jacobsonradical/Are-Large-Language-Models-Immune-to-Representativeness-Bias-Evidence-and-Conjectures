It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have a specific personality is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **The description is generic:** The description could apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:**  While the study has more humanities professors, this information alone doesn't make Jason more likely to be in one field or the other without knowing how personality traits correlate to each field.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to specific personality traits more common in either computer science or humanities, the probability is equal for both.**
