It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality) could apply to a professor in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** We should avoid relying on stereotypes about personality traits associated with specific academic fields. 
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 25 for computer science is too small to draw meaningful conclusions.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
