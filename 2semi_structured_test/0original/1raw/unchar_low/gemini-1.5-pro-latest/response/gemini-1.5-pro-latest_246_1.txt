It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.**  It highlights general traits (high ability, motivation, good relationships) found in successful individuals across many professions. 
* **The sample size difference is irrelevant without relevant information.** While there are more humanities professors in the study, this doesn't tell us anything about Jason specifically.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any randomly chosen professor from the study being in computer science, which is 25%.**
