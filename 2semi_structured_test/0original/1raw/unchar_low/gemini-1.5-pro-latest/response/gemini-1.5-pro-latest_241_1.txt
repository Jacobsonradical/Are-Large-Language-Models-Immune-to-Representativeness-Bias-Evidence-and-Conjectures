It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights general traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, which can be found in successful individuals across various fields, including both computer science and humanities.  

Therefore, given the lack of information specific to either field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the study sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This represents 25% of the sample.
* Without any further information to differentiate Jason, we assume the base probability based on the sample composition.
