It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, representing 25% of the sample.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues specific to either field.  Many personality traits leading to academic success are likely shared across disciplines. 

**Important Note:** This assumes the description was chosen randomly. If there was any bias in selecting the description (e.g., the researchers intentionally chose a description they thought was difficult to categorize), the probability could change.
