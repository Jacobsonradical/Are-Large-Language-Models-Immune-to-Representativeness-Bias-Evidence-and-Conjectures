It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The description focuses on common traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could easily apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Since we know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 0.25. 

Without any information linking the description to computer science specifically, we should not adjust our probability estimate.
