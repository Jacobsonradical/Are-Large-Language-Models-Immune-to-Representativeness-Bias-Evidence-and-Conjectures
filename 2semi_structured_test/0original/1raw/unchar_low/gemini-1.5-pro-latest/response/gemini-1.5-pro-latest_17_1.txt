{"probability": "0.25"}
```

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% (0.25) probability that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
