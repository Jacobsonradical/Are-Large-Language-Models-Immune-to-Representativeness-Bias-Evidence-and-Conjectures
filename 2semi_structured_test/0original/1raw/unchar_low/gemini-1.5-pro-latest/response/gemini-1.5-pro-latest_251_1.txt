It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:** While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are generalizations and not accurate for individuals. 
* **Description is generic:** The description provided is very general and could apply to many successful professionals, regardless of their field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are computer scientists.  This means there's a 25% chance that any randomly chosen professor from the study, including Jason, is in computer science.
