It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:** The description relies on general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could easily apply to successful individuals in *many* fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 100 is relatively small, making generalizations unreliable.
* **Lack of comparative information:** We have no information about the personality descriptions of *other* professors in the study. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
