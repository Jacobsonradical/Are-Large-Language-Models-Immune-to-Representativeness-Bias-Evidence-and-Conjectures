It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The information provided (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to successful professionals in numerous fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest an inclination towards a specific academic discipline.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the study. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total:
