It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  It highlights general positive qualities (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in numerous professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. 

Therefore, any attempt to calculate a probability would be based on pure speculation. 

**{"probability": "N/A"}**
