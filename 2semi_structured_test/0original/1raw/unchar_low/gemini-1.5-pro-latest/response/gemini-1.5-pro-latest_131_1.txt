It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the generic description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights personality traits and life circumstances common across professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** The study includes 3 times more humanities professors than computer science professors.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

**Important Note:** This assumes a 50/50 chance since no relevant information is given. However, it's crucial to understand that this does NOT reflect a true probability based on the information available.
