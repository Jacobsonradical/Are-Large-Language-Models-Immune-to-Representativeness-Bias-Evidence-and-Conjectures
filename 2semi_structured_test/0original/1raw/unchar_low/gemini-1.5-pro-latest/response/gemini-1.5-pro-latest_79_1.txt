It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming computer science professors share specific personality traits while humanities professors have others is inaccurate and reinforces stereotypes. 
* **Description is generic:** The description provided could apply to a successful individual in many professions, not just academia. 
* **Sample size is irrelevant:**  Knowing the overall sample composition (25 computer science vs. 75 humanities) is statistically irrelevant without any information linking the description to specific traits more common in one group.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as it being drawn randomly from the entire group: 25/100.**
