It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his academic field. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
