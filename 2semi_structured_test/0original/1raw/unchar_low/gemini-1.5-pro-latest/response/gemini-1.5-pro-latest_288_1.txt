It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The description highlights traits that could be applicable to professors in both computer science and the humanities:

* **High ability and strong motivation:** These traits are desirable in many fields, including both STEM and humanities.
* **Well-liked by colleagues and positive reputation:**  This speaks to interpersonal skills, which are valuable across disciplines. 
* **30 years old, married, no children:** This demographic information is not indicative of any particular academic field.

Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to a higher likelihood of being in computer science or humanities, the probability is equal for both.

**Answer:**
