It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in various fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are somehow different in personality from humanities professors is biased and inaccurate. 

**Therefore, given the information available, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

There's a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
