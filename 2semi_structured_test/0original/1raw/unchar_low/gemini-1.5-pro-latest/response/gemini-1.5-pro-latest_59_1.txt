{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description provided offers no information about Jason's field of study.  It describes personality traits and demographics that could be common to professors in various disciplines.  

Therefore, without any additional information to suggest Jason is more likely to be in computer science, the probability remains at the base rate of **0.25**.
