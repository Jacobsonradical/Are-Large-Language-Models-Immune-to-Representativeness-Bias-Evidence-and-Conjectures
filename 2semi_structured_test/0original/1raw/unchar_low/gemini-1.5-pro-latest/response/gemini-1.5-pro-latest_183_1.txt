It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or humanities. 

Since the sample size is 100, with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being in computer science is 0.25.  **However**, the description provides no information to update that prior.

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
