It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While there might be stereotypical images of computer scientists and humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The information about Jason (age, marital status, work ethic, likability) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just academia, and certainly not specifically to computer science.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
