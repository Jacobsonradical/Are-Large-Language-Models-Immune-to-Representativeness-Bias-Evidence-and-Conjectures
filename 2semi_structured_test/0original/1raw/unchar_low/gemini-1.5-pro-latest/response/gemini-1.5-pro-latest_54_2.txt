{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:**  There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the sample composition (25 computer science professors out of 100 total).
* **The Description is Generic:** The provided description offers no information that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science or the humanities. It describes traits generally associated with success in academia.
* **No Stereotyping:** It's important to avoid applying stereotypes about computer science professors vs. humanities professors. The description doesn't give us any clues to justify deviating from the prior probability. 

**Therefore, without any additional information, the probability remains the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.25.**
