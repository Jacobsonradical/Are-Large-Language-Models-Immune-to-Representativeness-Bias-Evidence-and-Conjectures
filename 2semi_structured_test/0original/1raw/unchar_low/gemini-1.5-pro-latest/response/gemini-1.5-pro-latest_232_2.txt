It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  be married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is stereotypical and inaccurate.  
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** The description doesn't offer any information specific to how a computer science professor might differ from a humanities professor in personality or life circumstances. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were subtle differences between the groups, a sample size of 25 for computer science professors is too small to draw reliable conclusions. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group. Since the humanities group makes up 75% of the total, the probability is:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
