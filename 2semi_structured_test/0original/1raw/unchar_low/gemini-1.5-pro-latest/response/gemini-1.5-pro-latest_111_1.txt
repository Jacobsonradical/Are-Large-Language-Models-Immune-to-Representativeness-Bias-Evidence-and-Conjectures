It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have certain personality traits is inaccurate and reinforces harmful stereotypes. 
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in any field.  It lacks specific details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his area of expertise. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
* This represents 25% of the sample. 
* Without any further information, we have to assume the description was chosen randomly, making the chance of Jason being a computer science professor equal to 25/100 or 0.25.
