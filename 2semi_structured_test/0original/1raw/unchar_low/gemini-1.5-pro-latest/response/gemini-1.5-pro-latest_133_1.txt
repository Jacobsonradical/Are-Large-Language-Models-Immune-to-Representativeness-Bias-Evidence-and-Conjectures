It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are found in successful individuals across various professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate other than to say it's more likely he's in the humanities due to the larger sample size from that field.** 

**To provide a more informative probability, I would need additional details that correlate with either computer science or humanities professions.**
