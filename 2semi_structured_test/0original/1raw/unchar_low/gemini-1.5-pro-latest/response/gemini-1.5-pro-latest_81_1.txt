It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** It lacks any information specifically related to computer science or humanities.  Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are found in successful individuals across many professions.
* **Base rate is crucial:**  We know there's a higher base rate of humanities professors (75%) than computer science professors (25%) in the study. Without any field-specific information, it's more likely Jason falls into the larger group.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be purely speculative.** 

While I cannot provide a numerical probability,  a reasonable response would lean towards Jason being more likely a humanities professor simply due to the study's composition.
