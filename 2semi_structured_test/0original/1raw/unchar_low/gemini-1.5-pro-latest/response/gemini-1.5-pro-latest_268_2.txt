It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The description highlights general positive attributes (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could easily apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

Here's why:

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the group.
