It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could be equally applicable to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are not exclusive to either field.
* **Demographics:**  A 30-year-old married man without children could be in either computer science or humanities. 

Since the description provides no information to differentiate between the two fields, the probability is based solely on the initial sample composition:

* **Computer Science:** 25 professors
* **Humanities:** 75 professors

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
