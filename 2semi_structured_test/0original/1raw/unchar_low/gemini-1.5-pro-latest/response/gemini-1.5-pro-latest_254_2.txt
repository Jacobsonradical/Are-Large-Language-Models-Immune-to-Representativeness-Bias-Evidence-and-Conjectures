It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields, not just computer science. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming a computer science professor is more likely to be a young man named Jason with high ability and strong motivation plays into harmful stereotypes. 
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description doesn't mention any interests, hobbies, or work-related details that might hint at Jason's field of study. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.
