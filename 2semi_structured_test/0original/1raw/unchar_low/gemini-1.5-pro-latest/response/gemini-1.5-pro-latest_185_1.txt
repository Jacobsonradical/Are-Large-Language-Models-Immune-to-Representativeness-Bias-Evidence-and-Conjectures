It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:**  The description focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) and basic demographics (age, marital status).  These traits are not unique to either field.
* **The sample size is small:** While there were more humanities professors in the study, a sample size of 25 for computer science is still enough to have diverse personality types.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm providing 0.5 as the probability because, in the absence of any distinguishing information, the chances of Jason belonging to either field are equal.
