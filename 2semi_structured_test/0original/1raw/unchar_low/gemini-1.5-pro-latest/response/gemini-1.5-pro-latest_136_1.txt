I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  There are no specific details that hint at his field of study.
* **Base rate is crucial:**  To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate.  Since there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the study, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. The description doesn't give us any information to adjust this prior.

**In conclusion:** Without more information that relates to the specific traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors, any probability estimate would be a guess and not based on the evidence provided.
