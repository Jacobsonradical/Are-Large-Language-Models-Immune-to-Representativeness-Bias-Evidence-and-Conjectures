It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies equally to professors in computer science and the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be married or have different personalities than humanities professors is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study involved a small sample size, and this description doesn't offer any unique indicators of either field.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
