I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a professor in almost any field. There's nothing specifically suggesting a leaning towards computer science or humanities. 
* **Base rate is crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. Since there were 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors, the initial probability of Jason being in computer science is lower (25%).  The description doesn't offer any specific evidence to significantly shift away from this base rate.

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need more information in the description that could be statistically correlated with either computer science or humanities professors.**
