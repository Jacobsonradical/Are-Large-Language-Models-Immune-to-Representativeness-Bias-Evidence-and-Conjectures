It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in any field. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:**  These factors are irrelevant in determining academic field. 
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These are desirable traits for success in any academic discipline.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  Again, these are positive social traits not specific to any field.

**Therefore, without any information pointing towards a specific field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group.**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability is 25/100.
