I cannot determine a probability from the given information. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a professor in computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his field.
* **The sample size is irrelevant:** While we know the study involved 25 computer science and 75 humanities professors, this information is useless without knowing how personality traits correlate to those fields.

**To calculate a probability, I would need information linking the personality description to a higher likelihood of being in one field over the other.** 

For example, if the study found that successful computer science professors were statistically more likely to be married without children than humanities professors, then the given description would make a computer science affiliation more likely.

Without such comparative data, any probability I provide would simply be a guess.
