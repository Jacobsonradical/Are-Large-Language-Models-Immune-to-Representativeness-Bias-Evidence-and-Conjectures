{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field or research interests.  It describes generic positive traits found in many successful professionals, regardless of their field. 

Therefore, without any specific clues pointing towards computer science, the probability remains at the baseline of 0.25.
