It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are desirable in both computer science and the humanities.  
* **The sample size is small:** While there are fewer computer science professors in the study, a sample of 25 is not small enough to draw strong conclusions from such a generic description. 

**To provide a meaningful probability, we would need more information that distinguishes between the two fields, such as:**

* Jason's hobbies and interests
* His teaching style
* Specific research areas

**Therefore, any probability estimate would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
