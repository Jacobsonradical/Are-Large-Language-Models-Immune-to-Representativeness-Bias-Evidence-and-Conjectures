It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could easily apply to successful professors in any field, not just computer science. 
* **No relevant information:** The description lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might differentiate between computer science and humanities professors.
* **Base rate fallacy:**  We are more likely to encounter humanities professors in this study simply because there are three times as many (75 vs. 25).  Ignoring this base rate would lead to an inaccurate probability estimation.

**Therefore, any probability estimate would be based on pure speculation.**
