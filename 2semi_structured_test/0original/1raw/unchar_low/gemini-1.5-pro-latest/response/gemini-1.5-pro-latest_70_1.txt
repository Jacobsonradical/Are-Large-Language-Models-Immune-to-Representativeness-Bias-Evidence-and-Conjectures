It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about the entire field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
