It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.**  Attributes like being "married," "without children," "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not unique to computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size difference is a red herring.** While there are more humanities professors in the study, this information alone doesn't make Jason more likely to be in one field or the other without relevant details about his personality.

**To provide a meaningful probability, we would need more information in the description that correlates (or at least hints at a correlation) with either computer science or humanities.**

Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful numerical probability.
