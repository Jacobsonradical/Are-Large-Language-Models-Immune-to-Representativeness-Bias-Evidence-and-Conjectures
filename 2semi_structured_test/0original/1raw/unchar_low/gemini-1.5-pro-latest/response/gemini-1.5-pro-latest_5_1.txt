{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description provided offers no information about Jason's field of study. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are generally applicable to successful professionals across disciplines. 

Therefore, without any further information to suggest Jason is more likely to be in computer science, the probability remains at the base rate of 0.25.
