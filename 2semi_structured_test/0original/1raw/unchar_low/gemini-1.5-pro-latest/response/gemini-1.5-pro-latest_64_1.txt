It seems you're trying to subtly introduce bias into the analysis. The provided description contains no information about Jason's field of study beyond being a "successful academic."  

Therefore, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the initial sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors were from computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
