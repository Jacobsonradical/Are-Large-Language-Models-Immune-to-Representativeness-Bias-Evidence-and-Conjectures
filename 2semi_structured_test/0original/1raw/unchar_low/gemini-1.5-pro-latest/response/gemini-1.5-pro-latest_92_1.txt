It is impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. 

The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no stereotypes or assumptions about either field that we should use to influence our judgment.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
