It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provided offers no insight into Jason's interests, skills, or work style that would make him more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are different from humanities professors based on common stereotypes is biased and inaccurate. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description focuses on positive personality traits applicable to many professions, not just academia.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the prior probability of any professor in the sample being a computer science professor.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are from computer science (25%).
