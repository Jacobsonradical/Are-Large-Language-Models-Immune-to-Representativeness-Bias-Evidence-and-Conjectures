It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be found in successful individuals across various disciplines, including both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of any randomly chosen professor from this group being in computer science.
