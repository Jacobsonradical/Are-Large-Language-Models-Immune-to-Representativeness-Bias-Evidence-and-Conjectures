**Explanation:**

There is no information in the description that provides any indication of Jason's field of study. Since we know that:

* There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
* There are 100 professors in total.

The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors: 25/100 = 0.25
