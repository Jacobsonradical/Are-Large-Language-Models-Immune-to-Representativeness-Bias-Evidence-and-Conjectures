{"probability": "0.5"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that provides any indication of Jason's field of study.  

* **Base Rate:** The sample has a significantly higher proportion of humanities professors (75%) compared to computer science professors (25%). 
* **Description Neutrality:** The description focuses on personality and personal life, offering no clues about Jason's academic field.

Given the complete lack of information about Jason's profession within the description, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
