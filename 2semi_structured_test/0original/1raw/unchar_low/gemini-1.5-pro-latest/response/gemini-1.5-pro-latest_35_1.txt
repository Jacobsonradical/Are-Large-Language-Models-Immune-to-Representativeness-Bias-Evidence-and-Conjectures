It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  Assuming computer scientists are more likely to be named "Jason,"  married without children, or possess high ability and strong motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description provides common traits that could easily apply to professors in either field.  

**Therefore, the probability is equal for both possibilities.**
