It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It describes personality traits and life circumstances common to many successful professionals, regardless of their field. 
* **The sample size is skewed:**  There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}
