It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professionals in both computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This means 25% of the professors in the study are from computer science.
* Without any information to differentiate Jason, there's a 25% chance he belongs to that group.
