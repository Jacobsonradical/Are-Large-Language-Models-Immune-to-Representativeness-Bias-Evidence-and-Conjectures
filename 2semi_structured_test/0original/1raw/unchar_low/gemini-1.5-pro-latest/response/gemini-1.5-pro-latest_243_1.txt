It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights general traits like high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation, which could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
