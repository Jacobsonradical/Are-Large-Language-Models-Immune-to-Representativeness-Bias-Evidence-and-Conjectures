I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his field of study. 
* **Base rate bias:** To calculate the probability accurately, we need to consider the base rates provided in the study. There are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means it's already more likely that Jason is in the humanities, even before considering his personality description.

**To get a more accurate probability, you would need to provide information from the personality description that is relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.**
