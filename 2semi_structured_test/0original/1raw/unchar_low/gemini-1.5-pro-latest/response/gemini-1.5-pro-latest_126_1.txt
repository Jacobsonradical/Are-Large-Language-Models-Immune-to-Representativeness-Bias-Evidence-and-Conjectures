It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There were 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This translates to a 25% chance (or 0.25 probability) that any randomly chosen professor from the study is in computer science.
