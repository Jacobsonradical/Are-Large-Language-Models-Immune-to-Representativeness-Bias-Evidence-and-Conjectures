It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits are not exclusive to computer science and can be found in successful individuals across all academic disciplines.
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors, which is a small sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions about the entire field.

**Therefore, without any information related to Jason's research, teaching, or interests, assuming he's in computer science based on these generic qualities would be pure speculation.**

Since there's a 25% chance he's in computer science (25 out of 100 professors), the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
