It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There were 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability is calculated as: (favorable outcomes) / (total possible outcomes)
* Therefore, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25
