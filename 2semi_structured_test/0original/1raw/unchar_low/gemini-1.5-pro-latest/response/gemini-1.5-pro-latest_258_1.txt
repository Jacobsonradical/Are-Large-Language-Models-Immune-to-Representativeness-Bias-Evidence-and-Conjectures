It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the given description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.** It highlights general traits like intelligence, work ethic, and social skills, which are valuable in both computer science and humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed.**  There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess. 

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}**
