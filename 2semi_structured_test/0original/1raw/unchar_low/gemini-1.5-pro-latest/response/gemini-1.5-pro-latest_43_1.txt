It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While we might associate certain traits (like a strong aptitude for logic) with computer science, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators of profession.
* **The description is generic:**  The information given (age, marital status, personality) could easily apply to a successful professor in *any* field. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate provided in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are from that field.
