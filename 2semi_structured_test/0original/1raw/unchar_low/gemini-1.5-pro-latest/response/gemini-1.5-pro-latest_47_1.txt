It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** The description highlights Jason's high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation. These traits are not specific to either field and can be found in successful individuals across disciplines. 
* **Demographics:**  Knowing Jason is 30, married, and without children offers no insight into his academic field.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because there's a 25% chance (25 out of 100) that any randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
