It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could be found in professors from any field.  Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study. 

Here's the calculation:

* **Total professors:** 100
* **Computer Science professors:** 25

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25
