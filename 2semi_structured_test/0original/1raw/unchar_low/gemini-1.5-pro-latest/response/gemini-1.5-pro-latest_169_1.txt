It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in any field.  
* **Base rates are crucial:**  We need to consider the base rate â€“ there are three times as many humanities professors in the study. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best represented by the base rate of computer science professors in the study.**
