It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in computer science or the humanities. There are no details that specifically hint at either field. 
* **Base rate bias:** We have a significant base rate bias. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities and only 25 are in computer science. This means even if the description slightly leaned towards a computer science stereotype, the higher number of humanities professors would still make it more likely he's from that group.

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need:**

* **Information relevant to the fields:**  Details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, hobbies, or even writing style could offer clues about his field.
* **A controlled study on personality differences:** The study itself might have revealed personality traits that are more common to one field over the other.  Without that data, we're just guessing.

**Therefore:**
