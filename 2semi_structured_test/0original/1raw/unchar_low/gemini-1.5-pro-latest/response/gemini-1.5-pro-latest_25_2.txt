It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** It lacks any information specifically related to personality traits that might be more common in computer science versus humanities.  
* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  We can't assume anything about Jason's field based on his age, marital status, or even his perceived "high ability and strong motivation." These traits can be found in successful individuals across all disciplines.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
