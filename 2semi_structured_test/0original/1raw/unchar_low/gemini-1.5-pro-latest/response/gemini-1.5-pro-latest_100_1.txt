It is impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provided offers generic details about Jason's personality and life situation that could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is a plausible age for a tenured professor in both fields.
* **Marital Status:**  Being married with or without children is not indicative of a specific academic field.
* **Personality:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive traits found in successful individuals across various professions, not just academia or specific fields within it.

Therefore, without any information linking Jason's traits or experiences specifically to computer science, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
