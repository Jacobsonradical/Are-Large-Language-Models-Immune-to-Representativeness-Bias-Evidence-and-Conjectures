It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **No field-specific clues:**  There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, communication style, or work habits that hints at his area of expertise.
* **The sample size is skewed:**  The study has 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly selected professor is more likely to be from the humanities.

**Therefore, without any further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
