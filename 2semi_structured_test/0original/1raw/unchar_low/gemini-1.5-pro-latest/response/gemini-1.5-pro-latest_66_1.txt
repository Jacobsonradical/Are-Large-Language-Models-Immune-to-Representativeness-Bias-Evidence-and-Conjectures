{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor. 

The provided description contains no information about Jason's field of study. Therefore, we have no reason to believe he's more likely to be in computer science than in humanities. We rely solely on the base rates provided in the study.
