It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is devoid of field-specific information.**  It highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed.** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. This means it's statistically more likely that Jason falls within the larger group.

**However, basing the answer solely on the larger sample size would be a fallacy.** Without any information linking the description to computer science, we can't make an informed judgment.

Therefore, the probability is essentially the same as randomly selecting a professor from the entire pool and hoping they are in computer science. 

**Answer:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 25 out of 100 total professors are in computer science, resulting in a 0.25 or 25% probability.
