It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. Here's why:

* **Bias in the Sample:** The study includes significantly more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25). This means a randomly selected description is three times more likely to belong to a humanities professor. 
* **Lack of Distinctive Information:** The description provided offers very generic traits. There's nothing about Jason's research interests, teaching style, hobbies, or other factors that might hint at his field. 

**To get a meaningful probability, you would need information that is actually correlated with being a computer science professor.** 

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability based on the given description.**
