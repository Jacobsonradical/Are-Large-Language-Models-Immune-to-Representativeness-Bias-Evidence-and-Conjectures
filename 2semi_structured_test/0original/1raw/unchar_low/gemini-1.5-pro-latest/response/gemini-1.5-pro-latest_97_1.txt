It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest an inclination towards a technical field like computer science or a humanities discipline.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** While the study included more humanities professors, knowing the overall composition doesn't help us determine Jason's specific field without further information.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as it would be for any randomly chosen professor from the study. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the probability is:
