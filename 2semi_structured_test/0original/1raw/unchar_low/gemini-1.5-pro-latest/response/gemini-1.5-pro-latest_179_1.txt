It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided.  Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw general conclusions. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
