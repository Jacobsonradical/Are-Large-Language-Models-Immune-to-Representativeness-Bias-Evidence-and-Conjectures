It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are different from humanities professors based on limited personality traits is inaccurate and potentially biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The description of Jason is positive but doesn't offer any specific clues about his research interests, hobbies, or teaching style that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science. This translates to a 25% probability.
