It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be 30 years old, married without children, highly motivated, or well-liked is based on stereotypes, not evidence.  
* **Limited Information:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.
* **Sample Bias:** Even if we had some statistical information about the personality traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors, the sample size of the study (25 vs. 75) is heavily skewed towards humanities. 

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm choosing 0.5 to represent a 50/50 chance, acknowledging that I have no real basis to favor either possibility.
