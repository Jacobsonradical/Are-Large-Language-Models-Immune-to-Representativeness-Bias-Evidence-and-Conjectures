It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could be equally applicable to professors in computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
