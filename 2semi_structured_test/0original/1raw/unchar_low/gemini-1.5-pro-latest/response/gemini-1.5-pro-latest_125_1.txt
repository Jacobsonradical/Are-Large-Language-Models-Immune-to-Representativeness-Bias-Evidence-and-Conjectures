I cannot give a reliable probability estimate based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  The description relies on general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Lack of Distinctive Information:**  There's nothing in the description specifically related to personality traits or characteristics that would be more common in computer science professors versus humanities professors.  
* **Small Sample Size:** While 100 people might seem like a lot, it's a relatively small sample from which to draw strong conclusions about entire fields like computer science and humanities.

**To give you a meaningful probability, I would need more information about how personality traits differ between the two groups of professors based on the study's findings.**
