It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances common to successful individuals in various professions, not just computer science. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because there is a 25% chance (25 out of 100) that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
