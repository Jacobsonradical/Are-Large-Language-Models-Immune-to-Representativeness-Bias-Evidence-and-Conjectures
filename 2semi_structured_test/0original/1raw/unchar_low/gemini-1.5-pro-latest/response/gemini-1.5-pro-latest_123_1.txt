It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. The description highlights general traits of a successful academic and does not offer any specific clues about Jason's expertise in computer science or humanities. 

Since 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science, a reasonable prior probability would be 0.25. However, the description doesn't provide any evidence to adjust this prior.

Therefore:
