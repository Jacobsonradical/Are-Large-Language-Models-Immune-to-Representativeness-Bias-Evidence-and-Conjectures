{"probability": "0.5"}

**Reasoning:**

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It focuses on general personality traits and life situation applicable to professors in various disciplines. 

Since the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, there's a 25% chance he's in computer science and a 75% chance he's in humanities.  However, without any information to differentiate his field, there's no reason to favor one over the other.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample, which is 25/100 or 0.25.  However, the question asks for the probability on a scale of 0 to 1, making the answer **0.5**, indicating an equal chance for either field.
