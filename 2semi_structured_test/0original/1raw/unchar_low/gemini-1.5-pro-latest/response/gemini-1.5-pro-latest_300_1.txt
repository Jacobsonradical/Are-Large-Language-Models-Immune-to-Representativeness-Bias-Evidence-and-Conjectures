It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description alone. The information provided describes general traits of a successful academic, not specific indicators of a computer science background. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:** Irrelevant to academic field. 
* **High Ability and Motivation:** Expected traits in both fields.
* **Well-liked and Positive Reputation:**  Desirable in any academic setting.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability is calculated as 25/100 = 0.25.
