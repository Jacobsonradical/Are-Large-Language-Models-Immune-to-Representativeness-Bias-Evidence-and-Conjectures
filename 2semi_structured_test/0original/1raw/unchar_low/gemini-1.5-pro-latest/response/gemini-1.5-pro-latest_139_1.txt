It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides generic positive traits applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is young for a tenured professor, but possible in both fields.
* **Marital Status:**  Being married with or without children is irrelevant to academic discipline.
* **Personality:** "High ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are desirable traits in any profession. 

**Since the description offers no specific clues about Jason's field, the probability is based solely on the initial sample composition:**

* **25 Computer Science Professors / 100 Total Professors = 0.25**

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the original sample.
