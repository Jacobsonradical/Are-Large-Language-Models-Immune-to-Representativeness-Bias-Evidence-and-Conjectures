It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It lacks any information specifically related to personality traits common in computer science or humanities.  It describes Jason as intelligent, motivated, and well-liked â€“ qualities found in successful individuals across many professions.
* **The sample size is biased:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study. This means even if certain traits were more common in computer science,  the higher representation of humanities professors would skew any probability.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. **
