It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about the entire field.
* **Lack of comparative information:**  We don't know how the descriptions of humanities professors compare to Jason's.  Maybe they all sound similar, or maybe they are wildly different.

**Therefore, any probability I provide would be a guess.**  A proper analysis would require the personality data for all 100 professors and a statistically sound method for comparison.
