**Explanation:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study's description.

* There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
* There are 100 professors in total.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
