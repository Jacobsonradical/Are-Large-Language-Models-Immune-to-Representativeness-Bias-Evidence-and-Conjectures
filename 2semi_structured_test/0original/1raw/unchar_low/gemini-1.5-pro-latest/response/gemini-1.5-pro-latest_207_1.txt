**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates given in the problem:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 25% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
