It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given about Jason (age, marital status, personality, and professional standing) is stereotypical of both computer science and humanities professors. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science vs. humanities. 

**Important Note:**  Stereotypes are not reliable for individual prediction. This question highlights how relying on general impressions can be misleading.
