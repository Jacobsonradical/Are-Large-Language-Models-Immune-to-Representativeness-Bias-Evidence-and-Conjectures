It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children at 30, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful individual in numerous fields, not just academia.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** While there are fewer computer science professors in the study, the description doesn't offer any specific clues to tie Jason to either field.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group, which is equivalent to the proportions in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 or 25% chance.
