It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the information provided. The description highlights positive personality traits and demographics common among successful professionals in many fields, not just computer science. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are valuable in numerous professions, not just academia, and certainly not limited to computer science. 
* **Demographics:**  Being a 30-year-old married man without children doesn't correlate to a specific academic field. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 25/100 = 0.25.
