It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  There's nothing in the description that is particularly suggestive of either field.
* **Base rate is crucial:**  We need to consider the base rates. There are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means a randomly selected professor is more likely to be from humanities simply because there are more of them.

**To calculate a probability, we would need more information that is predictive of being in computer science vs. humanities.**  

**Example:** If the description mentioned Jason's hobbies including coding in his spare time, the probability of him being a computer science professor would increase.

**Therefore:**

```json
{"probability": "Cannot be determined from the information given"} 
```
