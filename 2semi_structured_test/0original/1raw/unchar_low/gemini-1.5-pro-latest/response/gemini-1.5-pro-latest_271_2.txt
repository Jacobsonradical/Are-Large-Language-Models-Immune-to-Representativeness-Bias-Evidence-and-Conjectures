It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights personality traits and demographics that are not exclusive to computer science professors. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are found across various professions, not just computer science.
* **Demographics:**  Being a 30-year-old married man without children also doesn't provide specific clues about his profession. 

**Therefore, without any information directly related to his field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are computer science professors (25%).
