It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** While there might be stereotypical images of computer science professors versus humanities professors, these are unreliable and often inaccurate. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just academia. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

There's a 25% chance Jason is among the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
