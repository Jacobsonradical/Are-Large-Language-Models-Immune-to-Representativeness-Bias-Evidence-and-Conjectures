It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The provided personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professionals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:**  There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's research interests, hobbies, or anything else that would hint at his academic background.
* **Base rate bias:** We know there were more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25) in the study. This means it's statistically more likely that a randomly chosen professor would be from humanities.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be pure speculation.**
