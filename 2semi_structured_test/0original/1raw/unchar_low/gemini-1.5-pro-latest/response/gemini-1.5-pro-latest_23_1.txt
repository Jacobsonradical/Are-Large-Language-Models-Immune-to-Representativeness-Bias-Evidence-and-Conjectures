It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming computer science professors share specific personality traits is inaccurate and perpetuates stereotypes. 
* **Description is generic:** The description is positive but doesn't offer any specific clues about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
