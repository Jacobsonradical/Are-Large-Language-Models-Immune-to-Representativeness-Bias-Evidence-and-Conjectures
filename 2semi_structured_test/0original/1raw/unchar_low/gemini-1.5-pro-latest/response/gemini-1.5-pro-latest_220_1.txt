It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 

Since the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, a random professor has a higher chance of being in humanities.

However, without any information linking the description to computer science specifically, we have to rely on the base rate:

* **25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25**

Therefore, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
