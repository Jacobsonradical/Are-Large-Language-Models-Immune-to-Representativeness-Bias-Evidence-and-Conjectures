It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's area of expertise or interest.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, which translates to a 25% (or 0.25) probability.
