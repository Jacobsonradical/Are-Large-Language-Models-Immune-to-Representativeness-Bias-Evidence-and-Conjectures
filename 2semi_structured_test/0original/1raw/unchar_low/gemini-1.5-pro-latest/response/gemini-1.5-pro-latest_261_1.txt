It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Lack of field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at computer science specifically.
* **The base rate is important:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability that a randomly chosen professor from this study would be in the humanities.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be a guess.**
