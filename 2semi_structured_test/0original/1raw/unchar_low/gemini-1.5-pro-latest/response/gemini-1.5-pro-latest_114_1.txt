It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits can be found in successful individuals across any profession, not just computer science or humanities.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the two fields, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful generalizations.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.  Therefore, there is a 25% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
