It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study's sample size is quite small, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.  The information given does not offer any basis for determining if Jason is more likely to be in computer science or the humanities.**
