I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The provided description of Jason lacks any specific details that might hint at a computer science background. It describes traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could easily apply to professors in many different fields, including humanities. 
* **Base rate is crucial:**  To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. This means there's a higher starting probability (75/100 = 75%) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.  

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need additional information that is more predictive of a computer science background.**  For example:

* Jason's hobbies and interests
* Specific areas of research 
* Publication history 

Let me know if you can provide more details about Jason!
