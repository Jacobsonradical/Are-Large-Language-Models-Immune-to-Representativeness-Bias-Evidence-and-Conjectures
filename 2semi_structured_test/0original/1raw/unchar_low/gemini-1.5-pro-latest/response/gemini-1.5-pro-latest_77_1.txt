It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks relevant information:** The description focuses on personality traits and personal details common to successful academics in general. There is no information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. 
* **Base rate bias:**  We have a strong base rate bias to consider. There are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study.  Even if the description hinted at traits more common in one field, we'd still have to heavily weigh the fact that there's a 3:1 chance Jason is in the humanities simply because there are more of them.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**
