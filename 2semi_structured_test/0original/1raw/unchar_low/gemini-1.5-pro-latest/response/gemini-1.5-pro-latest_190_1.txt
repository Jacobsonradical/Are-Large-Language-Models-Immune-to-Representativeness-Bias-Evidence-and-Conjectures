{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25/100 = 1/4 = 0.25 probability that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. 

**Important Note:** The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. The personality description is generic and doesn't offer any clues to suggest whether he is more likely to be in computer science or the humanities. Therefore, we rely solely on the base rate provided by the sample composition.
