I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason is very general and could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his field of study.
* **Base Rate Neglect:** To estimate the probability accurately, we need to consider the base rates. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means it's inherently more likely that a randomly chosen description belongs to a humanities professor.

**To get a more accurate probability, I would need more information that is specifically relevant to distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors.**
