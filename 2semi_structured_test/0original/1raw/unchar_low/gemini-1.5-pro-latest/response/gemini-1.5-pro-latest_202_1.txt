It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the given description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  It describes traits that could be equally applicable to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There is nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, work style, or anything else that would hint towards his profession.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of any randomly chosen professor from this study being in computer science.
