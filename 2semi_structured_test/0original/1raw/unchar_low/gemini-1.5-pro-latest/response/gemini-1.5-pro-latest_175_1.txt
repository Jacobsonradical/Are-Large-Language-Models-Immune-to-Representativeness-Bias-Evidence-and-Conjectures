It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in almost any field, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:** There are no clues about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his academic discipline.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.**  Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 or 25%
