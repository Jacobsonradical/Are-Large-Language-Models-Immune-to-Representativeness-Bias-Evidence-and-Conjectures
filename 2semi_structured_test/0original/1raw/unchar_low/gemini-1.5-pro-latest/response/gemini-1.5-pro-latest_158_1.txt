It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, married without children, or have particular personality traits is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Limited Information:** The description offers common, positive traits that could apply to professors in any field. 
* **Sample Bias:** Even knowing the study's sample (25% computer science, 75% humanities) is not enough to make a judgment about Jason specifically.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability different from a random guess.  Since there's a 25% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
