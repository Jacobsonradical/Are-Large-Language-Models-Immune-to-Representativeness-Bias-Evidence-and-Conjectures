It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:**  While there might be stereotypes about personality traits of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are unreliable and often inaccurate. 
* **Description is generic:** The description provided could easily apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just academia.

**Therefore, without any information distinguishing computer science and humanities professors, the probability is equal for both.**
