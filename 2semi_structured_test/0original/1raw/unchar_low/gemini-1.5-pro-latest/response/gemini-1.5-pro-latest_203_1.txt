It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given, such as marital status, age, personality traits, and professional standing, are stereotypical but not exclusive to any particular academic field. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
* This represents 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.
