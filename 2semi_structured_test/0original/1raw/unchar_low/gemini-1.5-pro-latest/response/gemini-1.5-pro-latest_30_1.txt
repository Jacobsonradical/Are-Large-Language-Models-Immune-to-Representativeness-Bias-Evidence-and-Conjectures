It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields.  

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer science professors versus humanities professors, these are unreliable and often biased.  
* **Background:** The description of Jason's age, marital status, and professional standing doesn't offer any specific clues about his academic field. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science (25%).
