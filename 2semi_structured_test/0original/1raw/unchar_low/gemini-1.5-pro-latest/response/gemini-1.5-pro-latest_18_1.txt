It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be applicable to professors in various fields, including both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the sample.
* This means the probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.
