It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks subject-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits and life situation, not academic interests, teaching style, or research areas.
* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are somehow more likely to be "highly motivated" or that humanities professors are more likely to be "well-liked" is biased and inaccurate.  

**Therefore, I can't assign a probability different from the base rate.**  Since 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
