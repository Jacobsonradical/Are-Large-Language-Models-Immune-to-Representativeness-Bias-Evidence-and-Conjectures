It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.** It highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) applicable to successful individuals in many professions.  
* **The sample size is skewed.** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. 

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "N/A" }
