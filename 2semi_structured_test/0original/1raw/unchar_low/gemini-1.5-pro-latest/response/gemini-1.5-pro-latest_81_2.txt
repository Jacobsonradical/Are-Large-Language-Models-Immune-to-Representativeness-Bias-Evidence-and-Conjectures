It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  We can't assume computer science professors are less likely to be married or have different personalities than humanities professors.
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were subtle statistical differences between the groups, a sample size of 25 for computer science is too small to draw meaningful conclusions.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the entire sample.

**Answer:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
