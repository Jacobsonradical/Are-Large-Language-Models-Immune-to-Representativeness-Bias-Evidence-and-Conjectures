It's impossible to give an accurate probability estimate based on the information provided. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The personality description provided for Jason is very common and could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 
* **No comparative information:**  We don't know if any of the personality traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are statistically more common in one field versus the other.
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size, which can make generalizations less reliable.

**To get a more accurate probability, you would need:**

* **Personality data linked to fields:**  Information showing if specific personality traits are more prevalent among computer science professors compared to humanities professors within the study.
* **Base rate consideration:** You'd need to factor in the prior probability. Since there were 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors, the initial probability of Jason being in computer science is lower (25%).

**Therefore, any number I provide would be a random guess without any real statistical basis.**
