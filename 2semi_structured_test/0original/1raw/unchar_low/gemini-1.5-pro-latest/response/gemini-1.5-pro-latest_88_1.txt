It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at his area of expertise.
* **The sample size is skewed:** While the study includes both computer science and humanities professors, the humanities group is three times larger. This makes it statistically more likely that a randomly chosen description belongs to a humanities professor.

**Therefore, without any further information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. ** 

Instead of guessing, it's crucial to recognize that we need more data to make an informed judgment.
