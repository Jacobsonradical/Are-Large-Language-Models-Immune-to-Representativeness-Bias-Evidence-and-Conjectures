{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor. 

The description itself provides no information about Jason's field of study. It's tempting to try and infer something about his personality based on stereotypes, but that would be inaccurate and biased.  We should rely solely on the base rates provided by the study.
