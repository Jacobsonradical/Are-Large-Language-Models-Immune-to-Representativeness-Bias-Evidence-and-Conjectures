It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  It lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, hobbies, or other factors that might be correlated with a career in computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is small:** While there are more humanities professors in the study, a sample size of 25 for computer science is still significant enough that we can't rule out Jason belonging to either field.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
