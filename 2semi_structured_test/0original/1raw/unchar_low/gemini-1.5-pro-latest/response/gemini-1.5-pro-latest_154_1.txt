It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The provided description lacks any specific details that might hint at a computer science background (e.g., problem-solving approach, hobbies, interests) or humanities background. 
* **Base rate is crucial:**  To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. Since there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the study, there's a higher starting probability that Jason belongs to the larger group. 

**To illustrate:** Imagine trying to guess if a randomly chosen person is a lawyer or a librarian.  Knowing they are "well-organized" doesn't help much, as both professions value organization. 

**Therefore:**

```json
{"probability": "Cannot be determined from the information given"}
```
