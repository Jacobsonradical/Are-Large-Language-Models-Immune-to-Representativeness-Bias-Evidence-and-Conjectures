It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. The description focuses on common traits (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) that could easily apply to professors in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Bias Alert:** Assuming computer science professors are somehow less likely to be married, have children, or be well-liked is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Description is Vague:**  The description doesn't offer any specific details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field. 

**To calculate the probability, we would need information that distinguishes between the two groups of professors.** 

**Therefore:**

```json
{"probability": "0.5"} 
```

While I cannot provide a more accurate probability based on the information, 0.5 represents the baseline chance (50/50) since we have no distinguishing information.
