It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes personality traits and demographics that could be found in professors from various disciplines. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not exclusive to computer science. Humanities professors can also possess these qualities. 
* **Demographics:** Being a 30-year-old married man without children also doesn't provide any specific clues about Jason's academic field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
