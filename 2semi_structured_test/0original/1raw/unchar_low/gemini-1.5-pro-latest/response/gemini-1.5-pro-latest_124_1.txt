It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or humanities. 

Since the sample size is skewed (25 computer science vs 75 humanities), the probability of Jason being in computer science is lower. 

Here's how to calculate the probability:

* **Prior probability:** Based on the sample composition, there's a 25/100 = 0.25 or 25% chance Jason is in computer science.

However, the description offers no specific clues to update this prior.  Therefore, the probability remains unchanged.

{"probability": "0.25"}
