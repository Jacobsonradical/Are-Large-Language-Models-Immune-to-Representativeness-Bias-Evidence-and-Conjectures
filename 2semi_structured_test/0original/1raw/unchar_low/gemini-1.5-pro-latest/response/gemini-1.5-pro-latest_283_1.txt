It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

The description highlights positive personality traits and circumstances (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) that are likely common among successful individuals in *many* fields, not just computer science.  There is no information that is particularly indicative of either computer science or humanities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This means the probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25
