It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description focuses on general traits like work ethic, social skills, and marital status, which are not particularly informative for distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.  

Here's why:

* **Personality:** While stereotypes exist, there's no strong correlation between personality traits like "high ability" or being "well-liked" and specific academic fields. 
* **Demographics:**  The description mentions age and marital status, but these factors are also not strongly indicative of academic discipline.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample.**  Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
