It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.**  It highlights general traits like intelligence, work ethic, and social skills, which can be found in successful individuals across various professions. 
* **The sample size is skewed.**  There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.** 

{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}
