It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful professors in any field, including computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Bias Alert:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be well-liked or that humanities professors are less likely to be married is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Lack of Information:** The description doesn't offer any specific clues related to Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Since we have no information to differentiate Jason's field of study, the probability he is a computer science professor is simply the ratio of computer science professors in the study.**
