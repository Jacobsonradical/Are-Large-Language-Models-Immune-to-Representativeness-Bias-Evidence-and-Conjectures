It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While we might associate traits like "high ability" and "strong motivation" with computer science, these are valuable in any academic field. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description could easily apply to a professor in literature, history, or philosophy just as well. 
* **Base rates are crucial:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. This significantly influences the probability.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be based on pure speculation.**
