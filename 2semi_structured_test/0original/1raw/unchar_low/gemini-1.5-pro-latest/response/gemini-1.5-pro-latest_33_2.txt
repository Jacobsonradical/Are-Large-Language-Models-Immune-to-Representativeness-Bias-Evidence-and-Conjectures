It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of comparative information:** We don't know how the descriptions of humanities professors might read.  

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially the same as the base rate provided in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, so without any other information, there's a 25% chance Jason is one of them.
