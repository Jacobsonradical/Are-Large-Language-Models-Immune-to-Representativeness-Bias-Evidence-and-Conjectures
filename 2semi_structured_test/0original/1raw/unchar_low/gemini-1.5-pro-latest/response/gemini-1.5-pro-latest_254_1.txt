It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  It describes traits common to many successful professionals, regardless of their field. 
* **No relevant information:** There's nothing about Jason's research interests, hobbies, or even teaching style that might hint at his field of study.
* **Base rate bias:** We should consider the base rates. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means it's three times more likely that a randomly selected professor from the study is in the humanities.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**
