It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides generic positive traits that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These are desirable traits in many professions, not unique to computer science.
* **Demographics:**  Knowing Jason is a 30-year-old married man without children doesn't correlate to either field. 

Since we have no information to differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors, the probability is based solely on the proportion in the study:

* **25 Computer Science Professors** 
* **75 Humanities Professors**

Therefore, there's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor.
