It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While there might be common stereotypes associated with different academic fields, these are often inaccurate and shouldn't be used for probability judgments. 
* **The description is generic:** The description focuses on positive qualities applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just academia. 

Since we have no information to differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, the probability is simply based on the proportion in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from that field.
