It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are different from humanities professors based on common stereotypes would be inaccurate and unfair. 
* **The description is generic:** The information given (age, marital status, perceived intelligence, work ethic, and likability) could apply to a successful individual in many fields.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
