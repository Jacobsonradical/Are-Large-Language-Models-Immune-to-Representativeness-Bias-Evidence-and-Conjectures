It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are computer science professors (25/100 = 0.25).
