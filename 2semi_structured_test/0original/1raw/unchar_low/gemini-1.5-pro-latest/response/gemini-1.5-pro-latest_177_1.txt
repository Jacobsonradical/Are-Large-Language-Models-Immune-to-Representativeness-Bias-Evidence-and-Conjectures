It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that might hint at his academic discipline. 

Since we have no information to differentiate Jason, the probability he's a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 or 25%
