It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are different from humanities professors based on traits like being married or liking their colleagues is stereotyping. 
* **Insufficient Information:** The description offers no information about Jason's research, teaching style, interests, or any other factor that might be relevant to his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

There's a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the 100 total.
