It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at his area of expertise.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
