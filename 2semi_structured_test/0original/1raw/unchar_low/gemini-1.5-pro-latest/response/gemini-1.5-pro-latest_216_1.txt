It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:** It focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation), marital status, and social standing.  These traits are not specific to either field.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study. This means even if we had no information about Jason, the probability of him being in humanities would be higher simply due to the composition of the sample.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
