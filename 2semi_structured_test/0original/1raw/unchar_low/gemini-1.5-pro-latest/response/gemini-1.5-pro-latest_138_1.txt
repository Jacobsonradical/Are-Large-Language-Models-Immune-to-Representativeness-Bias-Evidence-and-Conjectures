{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25/100 = 1/4 = 0.25 probability that Jason is a computer science professor. The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study, so we rely solely on the initial proportions from the study.
