It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is small:** While there were more humanities professors in the study, a sample size of 25 for computer science is not insignificant. 

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm providing 0.5 as the probability because, in the absence of any other information, we should assume an equal chance that Jason belongs to either field.
