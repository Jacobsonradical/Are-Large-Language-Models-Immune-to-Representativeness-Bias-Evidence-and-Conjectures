It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The description highlights general traits of a successful academic and lacks any specific information related to computer science or humanities.  

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
