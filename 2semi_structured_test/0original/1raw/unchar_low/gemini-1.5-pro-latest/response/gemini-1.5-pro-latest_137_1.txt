I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a professor in almost any field.  There are no specific details that hint at computer science versus humanities. 
* **Base rates are crucial:**  To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rates in the study. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors.  This means a randomly chosen professor is more likely to be from humanities simply because there are more of them in the sample. 

**To get a meaningful probability, I would need more information that specifically relates to the differences between computer science and humanities professors.**
