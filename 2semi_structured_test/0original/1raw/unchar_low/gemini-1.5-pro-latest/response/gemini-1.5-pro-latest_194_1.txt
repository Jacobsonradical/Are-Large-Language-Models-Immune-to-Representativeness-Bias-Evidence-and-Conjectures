{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It describes personality traits and personal circumstances that could easily apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities.  

Without any additional information to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field or the other, the probability remains at the baseline of 0.25.
