I cannot give a probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The provided description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at a particular field. 
* **Base rates are important:**  To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rates in the study. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly chosen professor is more likely to be from humanities.

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need additional information that could differentiate between professors in the two fields.**
