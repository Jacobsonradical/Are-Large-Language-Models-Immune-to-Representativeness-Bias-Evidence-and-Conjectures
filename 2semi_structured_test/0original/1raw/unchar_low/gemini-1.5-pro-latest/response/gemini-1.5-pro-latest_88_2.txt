It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While we might associate certain traits with computer science (e.g., analytical thinking), these are stereotypes and don't accurately reflect the diversity within any profession. 
* **The description is generic:**  The information given (age, marital status, likeability, work ethic) could apply to a professor in any field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.**  Since 25 out of 100 professors were from computer science:

{"probability": "0.25"}
