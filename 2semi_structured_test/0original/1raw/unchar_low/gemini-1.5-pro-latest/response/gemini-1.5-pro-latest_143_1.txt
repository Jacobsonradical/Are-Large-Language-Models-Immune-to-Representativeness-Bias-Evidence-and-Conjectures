It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common to many successful professionals, regardless of their field. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, I cannot give a probability other than a random guess.** 

{"probability": "0.5"}
