It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have certain personality traits is based on stereotypes and not factual. 
* **The description is generic:** The description fits a wide range of successful professionals, not just academics, let alone specific fields within academia.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

There's a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
