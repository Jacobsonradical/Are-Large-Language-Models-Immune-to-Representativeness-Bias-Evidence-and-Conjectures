It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  It describes general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**  

While one might assume a slightly higher probability Jason is in humanities due to the larger sample size, it's not a reliable deduction. 

**To get a meaningful probability, we would need more information in the description that relates specifically to personality traits or tendencies common in either computer science or humanities.**

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}**
