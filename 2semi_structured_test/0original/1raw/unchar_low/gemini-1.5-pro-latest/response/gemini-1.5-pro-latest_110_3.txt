It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides generic details applicable to successful individuals in many professions.  

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is young for a tenured professor, but not outside the realm of possibility for either field.
* **Marital Status/Children:**  This is irrelevant to professional field.
* **High Ability/Motivation:** Expected traits for successful academics in any discipline.
* **Well-liked/Positive Reputation:** Again, common for success in any academic field.

**Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to computer science specifically, the probability is based purely on the initial sample proportions.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of 100 professors were from computer science, making the prior probability 25/100 = 0.25.
