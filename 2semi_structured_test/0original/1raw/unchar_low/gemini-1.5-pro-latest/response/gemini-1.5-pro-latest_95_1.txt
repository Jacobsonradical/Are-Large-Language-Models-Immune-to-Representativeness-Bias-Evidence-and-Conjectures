It's impossible to determine the probability based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are common among successful professionals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No relevant information:** There's nothing in the description to suggest a specific field of study.  

To calculate the probability, we'd need information that's statistically relevant to distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.**
