It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Since 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science, the baseline probability is 0.25.  However, the description offers no information to adjust that probability.

**Therefore, the answer is:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```
