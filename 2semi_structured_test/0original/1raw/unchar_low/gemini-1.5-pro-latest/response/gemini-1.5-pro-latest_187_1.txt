It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given—age, marital status, personality, and work ethic—applies equally to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
