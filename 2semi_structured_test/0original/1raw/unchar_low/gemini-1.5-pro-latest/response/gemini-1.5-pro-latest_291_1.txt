It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Personality is not field-specific:**  While there might be some personality traits more common in certain fields, they are not exclusive.  
* **Small sample size:**  100 professors is a relatively small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about personality and academic field.
* **Bias in description:** The description itself is positive and lacks any details that might hint at a specific field.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any of the professors in the sample being a computer science professor.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors.
