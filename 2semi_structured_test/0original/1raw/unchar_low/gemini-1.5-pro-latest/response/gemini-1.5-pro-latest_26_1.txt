It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes positive personality traits and life circumstances that could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not exclusive to one field. 
* **Demographics:** The description of his age and marital status also don't offer any clues specific to computer science or humanities. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** There's a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
