It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **Description is generic:** The description provided is very general and could apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just academia. 

To calculate a probability, we'd need some information in the description that is actually relevant to the difference between computer science and humanities professors. 

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability. **
