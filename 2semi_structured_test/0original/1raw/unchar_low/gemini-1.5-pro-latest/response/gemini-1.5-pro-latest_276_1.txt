It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:** It focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to professionals in various fields. 
* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** While we might have preconceived notions about the personalities of people in computer science versus humanities, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and should not be the basis for our judgment.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

There's a 25% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total 100.
