{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It describes personality traits and demographics that could apply to professors in various disciplines. 

Without any specific clues linking Jason to computer science, we should rely on the base rate from the study's sample. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study.
