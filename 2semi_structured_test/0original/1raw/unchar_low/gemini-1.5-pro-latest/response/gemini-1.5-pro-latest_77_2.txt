It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the two fields, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is too small to draw meaningful conclusions or make accurate predictions. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  25 out of 100 professors are in computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
