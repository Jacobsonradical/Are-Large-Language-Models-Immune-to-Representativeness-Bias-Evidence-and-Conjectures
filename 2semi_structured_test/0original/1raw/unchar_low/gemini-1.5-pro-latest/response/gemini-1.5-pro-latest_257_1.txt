It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information given.  The description provides general personality traits and demographics that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not specific to either field.
* **Demographics:** Being 30 years old, married, and without children doesn't offer any clues about his academic discipline. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

Since 25 out of the 100 professors were from computer science, there's a 25% chance Jason is one of them.
