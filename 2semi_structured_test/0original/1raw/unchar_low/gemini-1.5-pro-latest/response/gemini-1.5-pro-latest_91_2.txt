It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** We can't assume personality dictates career choice. 
* **Description is generic:**  The description lacks specific details that might hint at a particular field.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
