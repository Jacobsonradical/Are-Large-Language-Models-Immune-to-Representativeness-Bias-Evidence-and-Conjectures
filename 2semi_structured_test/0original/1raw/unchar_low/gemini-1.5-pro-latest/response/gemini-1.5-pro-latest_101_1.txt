{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It focuses on general personality traits and life situation, which are not necessarily indicative of being in computer science or humanities. 

Therefore, without any further information to update our prior, the probability remains the same as the base rate, which is 0.25.
