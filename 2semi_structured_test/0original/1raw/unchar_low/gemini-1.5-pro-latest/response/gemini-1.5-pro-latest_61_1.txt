{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study.
* This means there's a 25/100 chance that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
*  25/100 simplifies to a probability of 0.25.

**Important Note:** The provided description of Jason offers no information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor. Therefore, we rely solely on the base rates provided in the study's sample.
