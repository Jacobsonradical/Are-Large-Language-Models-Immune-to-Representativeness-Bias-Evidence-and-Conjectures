It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which means there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is from that field.
* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that would make one field more likely than the other. 

Without more information, we have to rely on the initial probabilities provided by the study's sample.
