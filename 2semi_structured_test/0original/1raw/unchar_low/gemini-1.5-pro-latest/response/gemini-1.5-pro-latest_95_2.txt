It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general traits like intelligence, motivation, and social skills. These traits can be found in successful individuals across various disciplines, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** The study includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly selected professor is more likely to be from humanities simply due to the higher representation.

**Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to a specific field, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

While I cannot provide a meaningful probability, it's important to note that statistically, there's a higher chance Jason is a humanities professor due to the study's sample composition.
