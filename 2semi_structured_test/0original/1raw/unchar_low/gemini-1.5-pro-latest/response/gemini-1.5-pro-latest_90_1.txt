It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming computer science professors share specific personality traits is inaccurate and reinforces stereotypes. 
* **Description lacks specifics:**  The description doesn't mention anything about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, given the information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate from the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
