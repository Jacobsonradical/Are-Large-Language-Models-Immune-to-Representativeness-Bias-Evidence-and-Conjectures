It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This represents 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.
* **Lack of diagnostic information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science versus the humanities.  

**Important Note:**  Stereotyping fields based on limited personal information is inaccurate and unhelpful.
