It's impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:**  The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common across many professions. 
* **Base rates are crucial:** To make an informed guess, we need to consider the prior probabilities. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means a randomly chosen professor is three times more likely to be from humanities.

**Therefore, any probability estimate without considering the base rates would be arbitrary.**

To illustrate, even if we assumed, based on stereotypes, that a strong motivation for work is slightly more common among computer scientists,  the higher base rate of humanities professors would still make it more likely that Jason belongs to that group.

**In conclusion, I cannot provide a meaningful probability estimate without further information.**
