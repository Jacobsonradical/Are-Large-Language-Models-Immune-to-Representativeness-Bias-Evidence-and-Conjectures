It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:**  There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at his profession.
* **Sample bias is unknown:**  We don't know if the initial sample of professors was representative of the overall proportion of computer science vs. humanities professors. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

Since 25 out of 100 professors were from computer science, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
