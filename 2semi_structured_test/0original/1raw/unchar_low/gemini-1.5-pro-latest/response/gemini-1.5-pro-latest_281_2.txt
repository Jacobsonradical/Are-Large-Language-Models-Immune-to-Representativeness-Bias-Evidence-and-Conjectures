It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This represents 25% or a probability of 0.25.
* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that would make Jason more or less likely to be in computer science. Stereotypes about fields should not be used to influence the probability.
