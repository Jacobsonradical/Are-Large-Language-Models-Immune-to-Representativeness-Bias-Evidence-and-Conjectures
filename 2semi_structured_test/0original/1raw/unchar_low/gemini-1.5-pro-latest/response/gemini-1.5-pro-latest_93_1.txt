It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. The description focuses on general personality traits and circumstances common to many successful professionals. 

Here's why:

* **No field-specific information:** The description doesn't mention anything about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.
* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are different from humanities professors based on stereotypes is inaccurate and biased.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science.
