It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The description highlights generic traits applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is young for a tenured professor but possible in both fields.
* **Marital Status:**  Being married with or without children is irrelevant to academic discipline.
* **Personality:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are desirable traits across professions.

Since the description provides no specific clues about Jason's field, the base rates from the study should be used. 25% of the professors were in computer science, and 75% were in the humanities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:
