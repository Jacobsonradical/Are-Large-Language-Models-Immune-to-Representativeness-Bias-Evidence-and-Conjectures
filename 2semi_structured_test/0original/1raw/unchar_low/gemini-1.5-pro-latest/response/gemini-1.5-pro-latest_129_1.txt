**Reasoning:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, a randomly selected professor has a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of being a computer science professor. 

The provided description offers no information about Jason's field of study. It focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances that could be found in professors from various disciplines. Therefore, the base probability of him being in computer science remains unchanged.
