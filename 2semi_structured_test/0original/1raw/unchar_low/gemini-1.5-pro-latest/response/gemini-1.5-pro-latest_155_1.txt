It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given.  The description provides general personality traits and life details that could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities.  

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not specific to either field.
* **Demographics:**  The description of Jason's age and marital status doesn't offer any clues about his academic discipline. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.** Since there were 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
