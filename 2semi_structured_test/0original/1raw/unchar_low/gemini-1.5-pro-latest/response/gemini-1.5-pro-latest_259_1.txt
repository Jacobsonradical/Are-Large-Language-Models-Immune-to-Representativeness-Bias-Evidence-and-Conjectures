It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, since the sample has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

{"probability": "0.25"}
