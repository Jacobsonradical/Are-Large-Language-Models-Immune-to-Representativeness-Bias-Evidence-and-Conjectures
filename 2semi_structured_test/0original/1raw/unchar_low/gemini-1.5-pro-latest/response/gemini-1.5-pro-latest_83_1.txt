It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. The information given describes general traits of a successful academic and doesn't offer any clues about his specific field of study. 

Therefore, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There were 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of Jason being a computer science professor based on the sample composition alone.
