It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could easily apply to successful individuals in *any* academic field, not just computer science.
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's expertise lies in technology or humanities. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.**  Since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science:
