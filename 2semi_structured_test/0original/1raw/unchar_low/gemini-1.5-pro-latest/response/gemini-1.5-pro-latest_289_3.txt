I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in almost any field.  There are no details that specifically hint at computer science or humanities.
* **Base rate is crucial:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. There are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the study. This means there's a higher starting likelihood that Jason is in the humanities. 

**To get a meaningful probability, I would need more information that is specifically relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.**
