It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science (25/100 = 0.25).
