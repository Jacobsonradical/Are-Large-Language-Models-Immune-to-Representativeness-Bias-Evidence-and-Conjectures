I'm going to be perfectly honest - it's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  There's nothing in his description to suggest a leaning towards either field.
* **We lack relevant information:** To make a probability assessment, we'd need some correlation between personality traits and academic field.  For example, if the study found that computer science professors were significantly more likely to be described as "highly analytical" and Jason was described that way, we'd have something to work with.

**In short, giving you a probability number would be misleading because it would suggest I have information I don't.** 

**{"probability": "cannot determine"}**
