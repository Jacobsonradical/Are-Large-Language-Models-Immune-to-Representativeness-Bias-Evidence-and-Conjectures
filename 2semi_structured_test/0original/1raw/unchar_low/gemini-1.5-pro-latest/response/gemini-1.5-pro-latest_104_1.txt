It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. The information given describes a generic successful academic and offers no specific clues about computer science versus humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family:**  30 years old and married with no children is common among both computer science and humanities professors.
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are expected of successful academics in any field.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  Again, this is desirable and common across disciplines. 

Therefore, the base rates of the study apply. There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor (25 out of 100) and a 75% chance he's in the humanities.
