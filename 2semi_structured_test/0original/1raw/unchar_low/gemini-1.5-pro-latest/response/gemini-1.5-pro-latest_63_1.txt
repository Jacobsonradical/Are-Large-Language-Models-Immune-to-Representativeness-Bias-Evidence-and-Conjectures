It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his academic discipline. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This represents 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.
