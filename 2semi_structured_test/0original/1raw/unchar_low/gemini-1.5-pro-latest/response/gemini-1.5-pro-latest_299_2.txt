I cannot determine Jason's field based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** The description relies on general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science.
* **Sample Size Doesn't Dictate:** While there are proportionally more humanities professors in the study, this doesn't mean a description fitting Jason is more likely to come from that group. 

To estimate the probability, I'd need information related to personality traits *specifically* identified as common in either computer science or humanities professors within the study's findings.

**Therefore:**

```json
{"probability": "0.5"}
```

This represents a 50/50 chance, reflecting that without more information, I have no basis to favor one field over the other.
