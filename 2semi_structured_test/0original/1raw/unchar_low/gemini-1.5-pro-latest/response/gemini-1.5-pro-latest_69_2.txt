It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The description highlights general traits that could apply to successful individuals in various academic disciplines. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  There are no mentions of Jason's interests, research areas, teaching style, or other clues that would hint at his academic specialization. 
* **Success factors vary:** While certain personality traits might be beneficial across different fields, the specific skills and approaches for success in computer science versus humanities are likely quite different.

**Therefore, without any information related to Jason's academic work, the probability of him being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group, which is equivalent to the prior probability.**
