It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to successful individuals in numerous fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's expertise lies in technology, literature, philosophy, or any other specific area.

**Therefore, without any information to differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors, the probability that Jason belongs to either group is equal.**
