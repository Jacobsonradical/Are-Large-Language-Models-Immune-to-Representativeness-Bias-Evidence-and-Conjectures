It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in various professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size difference is irrelevant without relevant information:** While there's a higher proportion of humanities professors in the study, this is meaningless without traits linking Jason specifically to either field.

**To provide a meaningful probability, you would need information in the description that correlates with either computer science or humanities.** 

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.**
