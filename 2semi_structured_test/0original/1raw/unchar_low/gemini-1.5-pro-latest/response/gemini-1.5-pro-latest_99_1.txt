**Explanation:**

There is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we base our probability solely on the proportions given in the study:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25/100 = 25% of the total sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75/100 = 75% of the total sample.

Since we have no other information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply his representation in the sample, which is **25% or 0.25**.
