It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description alone. The information provided is stereotypical and doesn't offer any specific insights into whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age and marital status:**  Irrelevant to academic field.
* **High ability and strong motivation:** Applicable to successful professionals in any field.
* **Well-liked and positive reputation:**  Desirable traits in any workplace.

Since the description provides no useful information to distinguish between the two fields, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors (25%) were from computer science.
