It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that are stereotypically associated with either computer science or humanities professors. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions or relying on stereotypes.  This response is based purely on the provided data and the principle of base rate fallacy.
