It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general traits and circumstances not specific to either computer science or humanities professors. 

Therefore, given the lack of relevant information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the base rate provided in the study description. 

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** The study included 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100. This means the base rate probability of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.
* **Lack of Predictive Information:** The description of Jason doesn't offer any clues that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor.  We are not given any information about his research interests, hobbies, or anything else that might be stereotypically associated with either field.

**Important Note:**  It is crucial to avoid making assumptions or applying stereotypes based on limited information.
