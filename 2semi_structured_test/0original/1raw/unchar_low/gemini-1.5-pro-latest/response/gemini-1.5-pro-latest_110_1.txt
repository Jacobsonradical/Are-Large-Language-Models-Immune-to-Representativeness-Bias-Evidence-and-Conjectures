It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that would hint at his profession.
* **Sample bias isn't informative:** Knowing that the sample included more humanities professors doesn't help us because the description could still fit either field.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}**
