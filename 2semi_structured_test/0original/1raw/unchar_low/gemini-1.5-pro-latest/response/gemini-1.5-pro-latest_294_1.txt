It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Since the sample had 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.  Without any new information to update our prior, we should stick with it.
