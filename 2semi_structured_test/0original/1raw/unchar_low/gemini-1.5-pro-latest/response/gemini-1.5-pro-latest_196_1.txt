It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits of a successful academic and doesn't offer any specific clues about computer science versus humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is young for a tenured professor, but it's plausible in both fields.
* **Marital Status:** Being married with or without children is irrelevant to academic discipline.
* **Personality:** High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive traits found in successful individuals across various professions.

Since the description is not informative, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

This is because 25 out of the 100 professors were from computer science (25%).
