It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in numerous professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors. This means it's statistically more likely that a randomly chosen description belongs to a humanities professor.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
