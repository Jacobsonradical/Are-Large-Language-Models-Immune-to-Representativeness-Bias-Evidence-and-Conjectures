I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in almost any field. There is nothing in the description that is particularly associated with computer science or the humanities. 
* **Base rate is crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. Since there were 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors, there's a higher starting probability that Jason is in the humanities. 

**To get a more accurate probability, I would need more information that is specifically relevant to differentiating between computer science and humanities professors.**
