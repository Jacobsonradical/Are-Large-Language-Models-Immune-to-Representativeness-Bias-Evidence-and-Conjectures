It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could be applicable to professors in various fields, including computer science or humanities.  

Therefore, without further information about personality traits that might be more common in one field versus the other, the probability is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
