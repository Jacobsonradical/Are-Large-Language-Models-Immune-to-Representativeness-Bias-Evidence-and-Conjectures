It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description focuses on general positive traits that could apply to professors in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** The description highlights Jason's ability, motivation, and positive reputation. These traits are desirable in academia generally, not specifically computer science or humanities. 
* **Demographics:** The information about Jason's age, marital status, and children is not relevant to his field of study.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

There's a 25% chance he's in computer science because 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are computer science professors.
