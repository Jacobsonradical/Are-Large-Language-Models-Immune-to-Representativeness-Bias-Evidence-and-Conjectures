It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at his academic discipline. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"} 
```

**Explanation:** 25 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, resulting in a 25% chance.
