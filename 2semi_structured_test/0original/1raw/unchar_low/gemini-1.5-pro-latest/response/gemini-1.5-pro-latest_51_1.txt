It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on harmful stereotypes.  These traits are not exclusive to any particular profession.
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description doesn't mention anything about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field. 

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.  

```json
{"probability": "0.5"} 
```

While this technically represents a 50/50 chance, it's crucial to understand that **this does not reflect a true probability based on the information given.**  It's simply acknowledging that we have no basis to favor one profession over the other.
