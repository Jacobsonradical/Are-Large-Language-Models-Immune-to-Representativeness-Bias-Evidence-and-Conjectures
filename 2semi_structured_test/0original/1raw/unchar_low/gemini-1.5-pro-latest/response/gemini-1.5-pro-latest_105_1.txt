It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Attributing fields like computer science or humanities based on traits like being "married with no children" or "well-liked" relies on harmful stereotypes.  People's career choices and personalities are far more complex.
* **Description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful individual in numerous fields, not just the two mentioned. 

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to specific personality traits common in either computer science or humanities, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm providing 0.5 only because it represents a neutral stance (50/50 chance) in the absence of any useful information.
