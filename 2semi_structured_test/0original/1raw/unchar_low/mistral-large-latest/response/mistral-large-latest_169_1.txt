{"probability": "0.5"}

Without additional information linking specific personality traits to either computer science or humanities professors, the best assumption is that there is an equal chance that Jason is a professor of either discipline. The description does not provide any specific traits that would make one discipline more likely than the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.
