{"probability": "0.5"}

Without any specific information relating Jason's personality to a particular field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Given that the sample size for both fields is provided as equal (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, but we are considering the ratio of 25:25 after selecting one description), the probability would be 0.5 for each field.
