{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, there is no clear evidence to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a professor of computer science or humanities. The description mentions his high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation, which are common traits among successful academics in general and not specific to a particular field. Therefore, I would assign an equal probability of 0.5 for Jason being a computer science professor.
