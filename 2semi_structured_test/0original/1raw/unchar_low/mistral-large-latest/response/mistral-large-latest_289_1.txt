{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: The given description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of expertise or any personality traits that could help differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. Therefore, assuming that the sample of professors is randomly selected, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100 or 0.25. However, since the given description does not provide any information that could help differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the probability of him being a humanities professor, which is 0.5.
