{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, it is not possible to make an accurate prediction about whether Jason is a computer science professor or a professor in the humanities. The description does not provide any specific information that would indicate a particular field of study or teaching. Therefore, the probability should be 0.5, as it is equally likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors or one of the humanities professors in the sample.
