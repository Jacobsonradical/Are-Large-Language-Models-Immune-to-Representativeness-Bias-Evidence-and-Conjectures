{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation:
Since the description does not provide any specific information related to Jason's field of study or personality traits that are particularly unique to computer science or the humanities, there is no reason to believe that Jason is more likely to be a professor in one field over the other. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.5, or 50%.
