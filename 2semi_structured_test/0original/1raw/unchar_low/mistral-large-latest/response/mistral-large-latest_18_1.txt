{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, it is not possible to accurately determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a professor in the humanities. The description does not contain any specific traits or preferences that would definitively link him to one field over the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or a 50/50 chance, as he could belong to either group.
