{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Since the description does not provide any information specific to the field of computer science or humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Given that there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based on the sample distribution is 25/100 or 0.25. However, without knowing the actual distribution of professors in both fields, we cannot assume that the sample is representative. Therefore, the probability based on the description alone is 0.5.
