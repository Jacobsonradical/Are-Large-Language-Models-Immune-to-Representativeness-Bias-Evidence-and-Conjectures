{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Given the provided information, there is no specific indication that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Thus, based on the principle of indifference, we assume equal probability for both categories. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.5.
