{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: The description provided does not contain any specific information that would suggest Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability should be based on the distribution of professors in the sample, which is 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, or 0.25. However, since we are asked to give a probability based on the description, and the description does not provide any relevant information, the probability should be 0.5, as there is no reason to believe Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
