{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not contain any specific traits or preferences that would clearly distinguish him as one or the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, as it is essentially a coin toss between the two disciplines.
