{"probability": "0.5"}

The description provided does not contain any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or equally likely for either discipline. This is based on the assumption that the sample is representative and there's no other information that could influence the probability.
