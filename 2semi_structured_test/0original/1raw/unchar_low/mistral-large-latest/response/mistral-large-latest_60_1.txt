{"probability": "0.5"}

Without any specific information linking Jason's personality traits to a particular field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the probability of him being a computer science professor is 25/(25+75) = 0.25. However, the description does not provide any field-specific information, so I would base my answer on the assumption that he has an equal chance of being from either field, hence 0.5.
