{"probability": "0.5"}

Since the description does not provide any specific information related to Jason's field of study or personality traits that are more common in one field versus the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Given that there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, one might be tempted to say that it's more likely that Jason is a humanities professor. However, the description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, not at random from the population of all tenured and successful professors. Therefore, without additional information, the best estimate is 0.5.
