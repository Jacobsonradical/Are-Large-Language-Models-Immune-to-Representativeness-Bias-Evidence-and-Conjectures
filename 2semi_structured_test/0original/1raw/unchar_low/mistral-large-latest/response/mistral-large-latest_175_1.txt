{"probability": "0.5"}

Given that the description does not provide any specific information related to Jason's field of study or personality traits that could be associated with a particular academic discipline, it is impossible to accurately determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based on the information provided. Therefore, the probability is assumed to be 0.5, or a 50% chance, as there are two possible options (computer science or humanities) and no other information to guide the decision.
