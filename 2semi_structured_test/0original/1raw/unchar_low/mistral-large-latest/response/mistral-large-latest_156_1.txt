{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a professor in the humanities. The description does not provide any specific traits or preferences that would clearly align with one discipline over the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or a 50% chance, that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
