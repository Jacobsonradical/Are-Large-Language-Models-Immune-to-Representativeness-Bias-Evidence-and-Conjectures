{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Based on the given information, there is no specific trait or characteristic that would make Jason more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or 50%. This is an application of the principle of indifference, which suggests that in the absence of any relevant evidence, we should assign equal probabilities to all possible outcomes.
