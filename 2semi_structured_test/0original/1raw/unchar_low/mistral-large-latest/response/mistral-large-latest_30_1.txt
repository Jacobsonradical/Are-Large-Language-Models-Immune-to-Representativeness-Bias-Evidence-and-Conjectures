{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: The description provided does not contain any specific information that would strongly suggest that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be approximately equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor at random is 25/100 = 0.25. However, the description states that Jason is 30 years old, which may be younger than the average age of tenured professors. This could potentially increase the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor, as computer science is a relatively new field compared to humanities. Nonetheless, without further information, it is still difficult to assign a significantly higher probability than 0.5 to the possibility that Jason is a computer science professor.
