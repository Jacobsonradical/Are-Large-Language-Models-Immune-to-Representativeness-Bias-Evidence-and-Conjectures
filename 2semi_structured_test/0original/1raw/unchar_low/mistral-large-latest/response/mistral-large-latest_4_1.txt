{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the information provided, there is no specific trait or characteristic that would definitively categorize Jason as a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or 50%, as it is equally likely that he belongs to either group. This assumption is based on the lack of any clear indicators in the description that would link Jason to a specific field.
