{"probability": "0.5"}

Given that the description does not provide any specific information related to Jason's field of study or any traits that would clearly indicate he belongs to one discipline over the other, it is best to assume an equal probability for both computer science and the humanities. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, which means there is a 50% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.
