{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Since the description does not provide any specific information that can be directly linked to a particular field (computer science or humanities), the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the probability of being a humanities professor. Thus, the probability is 0.5, assuming both fields are equally likely.
