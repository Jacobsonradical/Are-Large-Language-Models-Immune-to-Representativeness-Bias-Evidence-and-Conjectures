{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, it is not possible to definitively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not contain any specific information about his field of study or personality traits that would be more common in one field than the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5 or 50%, as there is an equal chance that he belongs to either group.
