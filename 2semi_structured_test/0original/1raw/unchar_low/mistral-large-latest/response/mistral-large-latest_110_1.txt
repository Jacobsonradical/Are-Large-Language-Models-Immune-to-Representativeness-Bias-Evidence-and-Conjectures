{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, it is not possible to accurately determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not contain any specific traits or preferences that would suggest a higher likelihood of him being in one field over the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or essentially a coin flip.
