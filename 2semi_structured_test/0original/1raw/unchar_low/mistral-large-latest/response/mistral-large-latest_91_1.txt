{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided in the description, there is no clear evidence or indication that Jason is more likely to be a professor of computer science or humanities. The description only mentions his age, marital status, high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation, which can be common traits among successful professors in both fields. Therefore, it's reasonable to assign an equal probability (0.5) to either possibility.
