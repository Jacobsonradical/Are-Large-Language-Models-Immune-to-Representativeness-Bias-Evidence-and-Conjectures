{"probability": "0.5"}

The description provided does not give any specific indications that Jason is more likely to be a professor in computer science or the humanities. Therefore, I would assign an equal probability of 0.5 to him being a professor in either field. This is based on the assumption that the sample is evenly distributed, with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. However, without additional information linking the description to a specific field, it is not possible to make a more accurate prediction.
