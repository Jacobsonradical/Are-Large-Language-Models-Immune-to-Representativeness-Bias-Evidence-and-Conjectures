{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Without any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, the best estimate is 50%. This is because there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, so the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor at random is 25%. However, the description of Jason does not provide any information that would allow us to update this prior probability, so the best estimate remains 50%.
