{"probability": "0.5"}

The description provided does not give any specific indication that Jason is more likely to be a professor of computer science or humanities. Therefore, I would assign an equal probability of 0.5 to him being a computer science professor. This is based on the assumption that the selection of the description was truly random and there is no prior information about the distribution of professors in the sample.
