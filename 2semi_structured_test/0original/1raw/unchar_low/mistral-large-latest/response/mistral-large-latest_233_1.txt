{"probability": "0.5"}

Since the description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, the best estimate would be 0.5, indicating a 50% chance that he belongs to either group. This assumes an equal probability for both categories, given the lack of discriminating information in the description.
