{"probability": "0.5"}

Without any specific information that would indicate Jason's field of study, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor. Given that there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25. However, since we don't have any information in the description that would suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor, it is reasonable to assume a 50/50 chance. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.5.
