{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: The description does not contain any specific information that would make it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability should be 0.5, assuming that the sample is representative and that there is no prior reason to believe that one group is more likely than the other.
