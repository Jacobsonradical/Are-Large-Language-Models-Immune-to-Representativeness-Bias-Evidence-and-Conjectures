{"probability": "0.5"}

Without any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, the probability is 0.5, or 50%. This is because there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and without additional information, there's no reason to assume Jason is more likely to belong to one group than the other.
