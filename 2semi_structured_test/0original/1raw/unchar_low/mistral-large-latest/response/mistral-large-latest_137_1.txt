{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information provided, it is impossible to definitively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any specific traits or preferences that would clearly align him with one field over the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or 50%, as there is an equal chance he belongs to either group.
