{"probability": "0.5"}

The given description does not provide specific information that would strongly associate Jason with either the computer science or humanities field. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be 0.5, or a 50% chance, that Jason is a computer science professor in the sample. This estimate is based on the assumption that the information provided is equally likely to describe a professor from either field, and that the sample size of computer science professors is 25 out of a total of 100 professors.
