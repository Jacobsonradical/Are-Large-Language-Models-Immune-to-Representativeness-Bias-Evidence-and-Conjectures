{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Without further information linking Jason's personality traits to a specific field, we can only assume that he has an equal probability of being a professor in either computer science or the humanities. As there are 25 professors in computer science and 75 in the humanities, one might initially think that it is more likely that Jason is a humanities professor. However, the question asks for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, not the probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor. Since the description was chosen randomly from the 100 available descriptions, and we have no further information to suggest that one group is more likely than the other based on the description, the probability is 0.5.
