{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the information provided, there's no clear evidence to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a professor of computer science or humanities. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or equally likely for either discipline. This is based on the assumption that the personality traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are common in both fields, and the description does not provide any discipline-specific traits.
