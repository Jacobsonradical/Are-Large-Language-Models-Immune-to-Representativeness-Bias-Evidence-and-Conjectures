{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: The description of Jason does not provide any information that would suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample should be 0.5, assuming that the sample is randomly selected from the total group of 100 professors.
