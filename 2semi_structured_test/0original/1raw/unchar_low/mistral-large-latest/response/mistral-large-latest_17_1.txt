{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Since the description does not contain any information specifically related to the field of computer science or humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor, assuming equal sample sizes. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.
