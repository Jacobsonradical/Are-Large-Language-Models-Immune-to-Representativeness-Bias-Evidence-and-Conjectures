{"probability": "0.5"}

Given that the description does not provide any specific information related to the field of study, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample should be equal to the probability that he is one of the humanities professors. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, as there is an equal chance that he belongs to either group.
