{"probability": "0.5"}

The given description does not provide specific information that would make one field more likely than the other. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is approximately equal to the probability of him being a humanities professor (50% or 0.5). This assumption is based on the equal distribution of professors from both fields in the sample (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors are tenured and successful, but the description does not emphasize any distinctive traits related to a specific field).
