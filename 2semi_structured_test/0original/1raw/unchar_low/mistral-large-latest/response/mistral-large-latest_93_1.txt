{"probability": "0.5"}

The given description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of research or any personality traits that could be associated with a particular academic field. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the probability of him being a humanities professor, assuming the sample distribution is 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. However, due to the limited information available, the probability is based on the assumption that the distribution is random and there are no hidden factors influencing the selection.
