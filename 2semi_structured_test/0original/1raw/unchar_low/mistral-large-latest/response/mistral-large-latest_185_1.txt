{"probability": "0.5"}

Since the description does not provide any specific information related to Jason's field of study or personality traits that are particularly associated with computer science or humanities, I would assign an equal probability of 0.5 for him being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The information given about Jason's age, marital status, and positive professional reputation is not specific enough to make a more precise prediction.
