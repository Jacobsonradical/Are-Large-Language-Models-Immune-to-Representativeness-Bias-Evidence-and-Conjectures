{"probability": "0.5"}

The information provided about Jason does not appear to favor one discipline over the other, thus it is reasonable to assume a 50% chance that he is a computer science professor. This is based on the fact that there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and the description given does not provide any clear indication that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
