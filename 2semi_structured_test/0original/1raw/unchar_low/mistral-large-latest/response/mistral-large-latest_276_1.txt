{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information in the description, there is no clear indication that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description focuses on his personal characteristics and reputation, but does not mention any specific traits, interests, or activities related to computer science or humanities. Therefore, the probability is best estimated at 0.5, assuming an equal chance for both disciplines.
