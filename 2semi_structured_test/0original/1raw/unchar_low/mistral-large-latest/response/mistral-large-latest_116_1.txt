{"probability": "0.5"}

Explanation: Since the description does not provide any specific information relevant to a particular academic field, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the probability that he is a humanities professor, assuming that both groups are equally likely. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, one might be tempted to say that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. However, the description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, not at random from the population of professors. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that Jason is more likely to be in one group than the other based on the given information.
