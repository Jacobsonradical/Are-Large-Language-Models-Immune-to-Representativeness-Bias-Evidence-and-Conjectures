{"probability": "0.5"}

The description does not provide any information that would make it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. However, since the description is very brief and does not include any information about Jason's personality, it is also reasonable to assume that the description is not sufficient to make a reliable guess about Jason's field of study. In this case, it would be appropriate to assign a probability of 0.5 to indicate that the two possibilities are equally likely.
