{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the information provided, there is no clear evidence to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Thus, the probability is 0.5, or a 50% chance, that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample. This is based on the assumption that the descriptions were written without any bias towards a particular discipline and that the information given is equally applicable to both fields.
