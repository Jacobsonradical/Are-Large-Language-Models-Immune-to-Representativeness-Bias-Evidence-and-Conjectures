{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the limited information in the description, there is no strong evidence to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description does not provide any specific details related to his field of expertise or personality traits that could be associated more with one group than the other. Therefore, the probability is 0.5, as it would be a random guess between the two groups.
