{"probability": "0.5"}

The description given does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability can be assumed to be equal for both fields. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25, and the probability that he is a humanities professor is 0.75.

However, the question asks for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, so the answer is 0.25. But since the description does not provide any relevant information to make an informed decision, a more conservative approach would be to assume equal probabilities for both fields, which is 0.5.
