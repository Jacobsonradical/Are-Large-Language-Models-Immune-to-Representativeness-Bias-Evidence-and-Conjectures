**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some details about Jason's personality, it offers little information relevant to determining his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative while humanities professors are less technical is based on stereotypes and not necessarily accurate.
* **Small sample size:** The study involved a relatively small sample size, making generalizations less reliable.

Since the description lacks specific clues about Jason's profession, the base rate of computer science professors in the study (25 out of 100) is the most relevant information.  Therefore, the probability is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample: 25/100 = 0.25.
