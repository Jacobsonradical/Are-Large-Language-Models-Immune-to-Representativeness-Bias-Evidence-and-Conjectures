**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability, but not extremely low:

* **Stereotypes are not definitive:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities Hint:**  Phrases like "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring" and "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" could be seen as slightly more aligning with traditional humanities fields. However, this is a very weak connection.
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities (75%) and only 25 are in computer science (25%). This prior probability significantly influences the likelihood.

**Therefore, while the description offers some potential leanings, the lack of strong indicators combined with the base rate makes it more probable that Jason is one of the humanities professors. A probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects this balance.**
