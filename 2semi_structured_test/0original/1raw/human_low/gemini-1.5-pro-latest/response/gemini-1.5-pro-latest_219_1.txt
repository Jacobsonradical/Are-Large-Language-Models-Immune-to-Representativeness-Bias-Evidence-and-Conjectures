{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct relevance to his field of study (computer science or humanities).  

Here's why sticking with the base rate is the most logical approach:

* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size. Any perceived personality bias in the description could easily be due to random chance within this limited group.
* **Stereotyping:**  Assuming that traits like "creative," "imaginative," or "not particularly technical" are more indicative of humanities is based on stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are highly creative and imaginative. 
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards either computer science or humanities. 

**Given the lack of relevant information, the best approach is to rely on the base rate.  Since 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.25.**
