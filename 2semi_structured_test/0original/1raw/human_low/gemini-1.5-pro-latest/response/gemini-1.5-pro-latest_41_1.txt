{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description precluding Jason from being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"emotionally driven"** are more stereotypical of artistic and humanistic pursuits.
* **"Not particularly technical"** makes it less likely he's in a highly technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes. It's entirely possible for a computer science professor to fit Jason's description. However, given the base rates (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities), and the description leaning towards humanities stereotypes, the probability is lower than 0.5 (a random guess).
