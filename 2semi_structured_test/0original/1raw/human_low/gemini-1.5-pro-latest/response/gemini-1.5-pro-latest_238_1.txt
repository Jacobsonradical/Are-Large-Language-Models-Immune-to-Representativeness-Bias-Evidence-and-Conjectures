{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or his skills that would indicate whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25/100 = 25% of the sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75/100 = 75% of the sample.

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply his representation in the original sample, which is **25%**.
