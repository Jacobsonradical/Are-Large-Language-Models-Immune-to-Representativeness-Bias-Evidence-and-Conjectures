{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing that strongly points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. These are harmful stereotypes. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only looked at 25 computer science professors, which is a very small sample size to draw conclusions from.
* **Base rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 were in the humanities and only 25 were in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities and only a 25% chance they are in computer science.

**Therefore, based on the base rate alone, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) is a reasonable starting point. The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly shift this probability.**
