**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information that would definitively point towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) and lacks traits often associated with computer science professors (technical, analytical). However, these are just stereotypes and not reliable indicators of profession. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making the probability inherently lower. 
* **Base Rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is much higher (75%) than computer science professors (25%).  This significantly influences the overall probability.

**Therefore, while it's impossible to be certain without more information, a probability of 0.2 (20%) seems reasonable.  This reflects the lower base rate of computer science professors in the study while acknowledging that the description doesn't strongly suggest either profession.**
