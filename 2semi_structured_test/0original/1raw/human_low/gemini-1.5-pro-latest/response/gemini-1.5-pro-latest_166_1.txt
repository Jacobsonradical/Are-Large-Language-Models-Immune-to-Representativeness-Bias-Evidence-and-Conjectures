{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators that would clearly point to him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description touches upon some stereotypical traits associated with humanities fields (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading), but these are not exclusive to humanities and can be found in individuals across various disciplines.
* **Technical skill is not mentioned:**  The description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical." While this might suggest a lower probability of being in computer science, it's not definitive. Many computer science fields, especially those with a strong theoretical focus, might not require exceptional technical skills in the traditional sense. 

**Base Rate:** The most crucial factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, only 25 (25%) are in computer science. This means even without any information about Jason, there's a higher probability he's in the humanities. 

**Therefore, while the probability is not zero, it is likely lower than the base rate of 0.25. A probability of 0.2 reflects this reasoning.**
