**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong evidence to definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to associate "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't consider the many different strengths and approaches within both computer science and humanities. 
* **Humanities can be creative and innovative:**  Fields within the humanities (like digital humanities, computational linguistics)  often require significant technical skill and innovation.  
* **Personality is not a predictor:** While personality can play a role in career choices, it's not a definitive indicator of academic discipline.

**The Prior Probability:**

Given that the sample size for humanities professors (75) is three times larger than computer science professors (25), the prior probability of Jason being in humanities is higher. 

**Therefore, a probability leaning slightly towards humanities (0.2 for computer science) is more reasonable than assuming he is more likely to be a computer science professor.**
