{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, certain aspects make it seem less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase stands out as potentially important. While computer science involves creativity, it is fundamentally a technical field. 
* **Humanities Stereotype**: The description aligns somewhat with a stereotypical view of someone in the humanities (creative, enjoys reading, emotionally driven). 

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are unreliable for individual assessments. However, given the limited information, we are relying on base rates (25% computer science, 75% humanities) and slight cues within the description. 

**A low probability (0.1) reflects the uncertainty while acknowledging the cues that make it seem less likely Jason is in computer science.**
