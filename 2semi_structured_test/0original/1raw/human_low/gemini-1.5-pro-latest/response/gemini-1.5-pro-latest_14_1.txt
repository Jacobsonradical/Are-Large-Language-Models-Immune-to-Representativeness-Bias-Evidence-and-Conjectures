{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why my probability is closer to the base rate (25% chance of being in computer science) than to 0.5 (50/50):

* **Base Rate:**  The most important factor is the sample composition. There's a 25% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science and a 75% chance they are in the humanities.
* **Description Ambiguity:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a non-technical nature. These traits are not exclusive to either field. 
    *  While some might stereotype computer science as less focused on emotional drive, this is a generalization and not a reliable indicator. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information.  This description doesn't provide strong evidence to deviate significantly from the base rate probability.
