{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, several factors make it slightly *less* likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase stands out as potentially significant. While not all computer science professors are extremely technical outside of their research, it's a field where technical aptitude is generally assumed.
* **Humanities Stereotypes**:  The description aligns with common stereotypes about people in the humanities: creative, imaginative, enjoys reading, etc. While stereotypes are not always accurate, they can influence our base-rate assumptions.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size**: 25 computer science professors is a very small sample. It's entirely possible to have individuals within that group who don't fit the typical mold.
* **Lack of Strong Indicators**: The description lacks strong indicators either way. There's nothing about Jason's interests or personality that definitively points to computer science or rules it out.

**Overall:** 

My probability estimate of 0.1 (10%) suggests it's less likely that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description, but it's far from impossible.
