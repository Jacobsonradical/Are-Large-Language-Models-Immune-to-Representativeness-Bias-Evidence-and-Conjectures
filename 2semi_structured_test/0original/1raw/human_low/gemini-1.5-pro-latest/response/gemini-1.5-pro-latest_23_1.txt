{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that definitively places him in either computer science or the humanities. Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 25% chance that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science. 

Since the description offers no further clues, we stick with the initial probability of 25%.
