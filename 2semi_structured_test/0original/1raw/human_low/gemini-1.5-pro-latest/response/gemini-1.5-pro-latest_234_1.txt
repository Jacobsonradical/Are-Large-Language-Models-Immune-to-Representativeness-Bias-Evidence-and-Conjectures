Although the description of Jason might seem more stereotypical of a humanities professor, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study:

* There are 25 computer science professors.
* There are 75 humanities professors.

This means there's a 25% (25/100) chance that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.  The provided personality description might make us lean one way or another, but without further information about how these traits actually correlate with academic fields, the base rate is our best guide.
