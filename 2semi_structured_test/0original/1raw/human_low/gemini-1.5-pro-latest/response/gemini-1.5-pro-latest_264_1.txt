{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession. 

Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **Base Rate:**  The sample has significantly more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25).  This means, even without any personality information, there's a higher baseline chance that a randomly chosen professor would be from humanities. 
* **Stereotypes:**  The description might play into some stereotypes about humanities scholars being more "creative," "imaginative," and less "technical." However, these stereotypes are unreliable for determining an individual's profession.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information. There are many creative and passionate computer science professors, and conversely, many humanities professors are highly technical.
