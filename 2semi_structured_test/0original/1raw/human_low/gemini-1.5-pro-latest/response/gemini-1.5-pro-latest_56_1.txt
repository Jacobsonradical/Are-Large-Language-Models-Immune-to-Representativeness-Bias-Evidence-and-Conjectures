{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers no concrete evidence to suggest whether he's in computer science or humanities.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming traits like "creative," "imaginative," or even "not particularly technical" automatically align with a specific field is flawed.  Both computer science and humanities require creativity and imagination.
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, making it statistically more likely that Jason belongs to the larger group (humanities).

**Therefore, without any information directly relating Jason's skills or interests to either field, the probability is simply based on the sample proportions:**

* 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 probability
