{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is based on stereotypes and not necessarily true.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study's sample size is relatively small, and drawing strong conclusions about personality traits definitively linked to either profession is difficult. 
* **Base Rate:** The most crucial factor is the base rate.  Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities and only 25 are in computer science.  This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from humanities, making it statistically more likely Jason is in the humanities.

**Therefore, while I cannot definitively say Jason isn't a computer science professor, the probability is lower based on the higher representation of humanities professors in the sample.**
