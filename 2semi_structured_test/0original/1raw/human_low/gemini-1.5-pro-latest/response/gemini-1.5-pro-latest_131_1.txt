{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, there's nothing that strongly indicates whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven and more technical. However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't consider the diversity within academic fields. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study has three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25).  This means it's statistically more likely that a randomly selected professor from the study would be in the humanities.

**Given the limited information and the sample composition, a probability of 0.2 (reflecting the base rate of computer science professors in the study) is a reasonable estimate.**
