{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to strongly suggest he's a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities scholars (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of profession. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it statistically less likely that a randomly chosen description would be one of theirs. 
* **Lack of Technical Skill Mention:**  The description explicitly mentions Jason is "not particularly technical," which might be considered unusual for a computer science professor.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid making assumptions based purely on stereotypes. This answer leans towards a lower probability due to the lack of strong indicators of a computer science background, but it's by no means certain.
