{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively rules out Jason being a computer science professor, some aspects make it less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase suggests Jason might not naturally gravitate towards a field heavily reliant on technical skills. 
* **Creative and imaginative, emotionally driven**: These traits are often associated with humanities fields, though they can certainly exist in computer science professionals too.

**Important Note:** This is a very weak prediction based on limited information.  Many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and not driven solely by technical expertise. This answer is simply based on probabilities given the way the question is framed and the stereotypes it might evoke.
