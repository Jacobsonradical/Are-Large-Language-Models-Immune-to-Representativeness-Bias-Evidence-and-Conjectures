{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers no direct evidence about his field of study. The base rate of computer science professors in the study is 25 out of 100, or 25%. Without any information linking the personality description to computer science specifically, the probability remains at the base rate.
