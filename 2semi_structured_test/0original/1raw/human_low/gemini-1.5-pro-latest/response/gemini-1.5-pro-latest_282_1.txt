**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it doesn't offer strong evidence to determine if he's a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to associate traits like "technical" with computer science, but this relies on stereotypes and doesn't account for the diversity within academic fields.
* **Sample size matters:** The study has a significantly larger proportion of humanities professors (75%) compared to computer science professors (25%). This means it's statistically more likely that a randomly chosen professor from this sample would be from the humanities. 

**Considering the limited information and the sample bias, a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) seems reasonable. However, it's crucial to emphasize that this is a very uncertain estimate.**
