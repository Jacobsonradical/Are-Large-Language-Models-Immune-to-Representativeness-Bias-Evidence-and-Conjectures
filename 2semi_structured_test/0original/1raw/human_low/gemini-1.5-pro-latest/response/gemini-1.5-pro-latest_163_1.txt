{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers no direct evidence about his field of study. The base rate, or prior probability, becomes crucial in this case. 

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 (25%) are in computer science and 75 (75%) are in the humanities. 

Without any information suggesting a computer science background, it's more likely that Jason falls into the larger group (humanities). Therefore, a probability close to the base rate of 0.25 for computer science is more reasonable than a probability closer to 0.75. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment, not a definitive conclusion.  The description *could* fit a computer science professor, but we lack the information to justify a probability much higher or lower than the base rate.
