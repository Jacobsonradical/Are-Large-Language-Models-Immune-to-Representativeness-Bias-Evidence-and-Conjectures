**Reasoning:**

While there are some clues in the description that might lead one way or another, they are ultimately very weak:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** applies to both fields.  Computer science, especially at higher levels, involves a great deal of creativity and abstract problem-solving.
* **"Emotionally driven"** is a stereotype more often associated with humanities, but doesn't preclude someone from being in computer science.
* **"Gifted and passionate"** is again, applicable to both fields.
* **"Not particularly technical"** seems to lean away from computer science, but could mean many things.  Maybe he excels in theoretical computer science rather than hands-on programming.

**The most important factor is the sample size:**  There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. 

**Therefore, the prior probability of any given description belonging to a computer science professor is significantly lower (25%) than the probability of it belonging to a humanities professor (75%).**  The description doesn't provide enough evidence to significantly shift away from that prior probability.
