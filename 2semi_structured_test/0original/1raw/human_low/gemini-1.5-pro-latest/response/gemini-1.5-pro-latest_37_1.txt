**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little to no information directly relevant to his field of study. 

Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:**  There's a common stereotype that computer science professors are more technical and less emotionally driven. However, this is a generalization and doesn't hold true for everyone.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes.  Without more information about Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests, it's impossible to determine his field with any degree of certainty.
