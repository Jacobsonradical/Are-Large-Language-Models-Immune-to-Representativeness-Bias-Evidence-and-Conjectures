{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why my probability is low but not zero:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to assume a computer science professor would be more "technical." However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't account for individual variation within a field. 
* **Humanities is a larger sample:** The study includes 3 times as many humanities professors. This means it's statistically more likely Jason falls into that group.
* **Some traits are slightly suggestive:**  "Creative and imaginative" and "not particularly technical" could be seen as slightly more aligning with humanities fields, but these are weak indicators.

**Important Note:** A single personality description is not a reliable way to predict someone's profession. This exercise highlights the limitations of stereotypes and the importance of considering base rates in probability judgments.
