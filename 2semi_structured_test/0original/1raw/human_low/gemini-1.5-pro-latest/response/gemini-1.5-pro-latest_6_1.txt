{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no stereotypical personality tied to a specific field, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"emotionally driven"** are more commonly linked to fields like literature, art, or philosophy. 
* **"Not particularly technical"**  further suggests a lower likelihood of being in a highly technical field like computer science.

It's crucial to note this is a probability, not a certainty. There are creative and passionate computer scientists! However, based on the description and the study's composition (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science), a lower probability is assigned.
