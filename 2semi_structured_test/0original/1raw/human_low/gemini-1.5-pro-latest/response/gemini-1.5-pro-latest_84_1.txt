{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators that would definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests a lower likelihood of being in a highly technical field like computer science. However, it's not definitive. There are subfields within computer science that are less technical and more focused on design, human-computer interaction, or theoretical aspects.
* **Other traits**: Traits like "creative", "imaginative", "emotionally driven", "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring" are found in both computer science and humanities professors. 

**Important Note:** This is a very weak prediction.  The description is simply not informative enough to make a strong judgment.  A true probability would require analyzing the prevalence of these traits within both the computer science and humanities professor groups in the study data.
