{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, some aspects make it seem less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase stands out as a potential mismatch for a computer science professor, a field highly reliant on technical skills. 
* **Humanities Stereotype**:  The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a love for reading and exploring. These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, align more with common stereotypes of professionals in those fields.

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are unreliable for individual assessments.  There are many creative and emotionally driven computer scientists, and many technically-minded individuals in the humanities. However, given the limited information and the study's focus on "common traits," the description leans slightly towards Jason being in the larger humanities group (75 out of 100). 

Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (10%) reflects that it's less likely, but not impossible, that Jason is a computer science professor.
