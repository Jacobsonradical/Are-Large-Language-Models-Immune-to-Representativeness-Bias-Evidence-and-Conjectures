{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study. 

Here's why my probability is low but not zero:

* **Stereotypes are not definitive:** It's tempting to associate "technical" with computer science. However, many humanities fields require strong technical skills (digital humanities, data analysis in history, etc.).  Conversely, some computer science areas, like AI ethics or human-computer interaction, might attract individuals with the traits described.
* **Small Sample Size:** With only 25 computer science professors in the study, even if the description were slightly suggestive of a humanities personality, it wouldn't be strong evidence.

**Ultimately, without more information directly related to Jason's research or academic interests, a probability leaning towards him being in the larger humanities group (75 out of 100) is more reasonable.**
