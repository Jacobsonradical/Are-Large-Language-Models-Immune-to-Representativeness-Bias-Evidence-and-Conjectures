{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable for judging an individual. 
* **Humanities encompass a broad range:** The description might fit various humanities disciplines, but it doesn't definitively exclude computer science.
* **Base rate is crucial:**  The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors, a 3:1 ratio. This prior probability significantly influences our estimate.

**Given the lack of strong evidence and the significantly higher base rate for humanities professors, a probability of 0.2 (20%) seems reasonable.**  This reflects the higher likelihood of Jason belonging to the larger group, while still acknowledging the possibility he could be in computer science.
