{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively rules out Jason being a computer science professor, several factors make it less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase suggests Jason might not gravitate towards a field heavily reliant on technical skills.
* **Humanities Stereotype**: The description aligns with some general stereotypes about people drawn to the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven). While stereotypes are not reliable indicators, they can subtly influence our estimations. 

**Important Note:** This is a low probability, not a zero probability.  There are creative and less technically-focused individuals within computer science, and the description offers only a limited glimpse into Jason's personality.
