**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that definitively places him as a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While there might be stereotypes associated with computer science (technical) and humanities (creative), these are broad generalizations and not accurate predictors for individuals.
* **Personality is complex:** The description highlights personality traits (creative, imaginative) that could be found in successful academics across many disciplines, not just humanities.

**Since we have no information to bias our decision, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

* 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 probability
