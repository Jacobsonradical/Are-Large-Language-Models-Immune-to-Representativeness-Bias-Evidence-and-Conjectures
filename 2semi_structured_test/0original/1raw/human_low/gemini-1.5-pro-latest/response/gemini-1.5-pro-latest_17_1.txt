**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is stereotypically associated with computer science or the humanities.  Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study's setup. 

* 25 out of 100 professors were in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that any randomly chosen professor from the study is a computer science professor.
