**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits more stereotypically associated with humanities professors. Here's why:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**: These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, are often seen as central to fields like literature, art, and philosophy.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: The emphasis on being "not particularly technical" suggests a field where technical skills might be less central than things like writing, critical thinking, or artistic expression. 

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are not always accurate. Many computer scientists are highly creative and emotionally driven, and many humanities scholars possess strong technical skills. This response is based on probabilities derived from common perceptions rather than definitive proof.
