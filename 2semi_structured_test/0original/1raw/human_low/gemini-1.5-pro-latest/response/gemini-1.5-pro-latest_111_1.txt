{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards him being in computer science (25% chance) but acknowledge it's not definitive:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** applies to both fields. Computer science, especially in areas like AI or human-computer interaction, requires a lot of creativity. Humanities are obviously associated with these traits as well.
* **"Emotionally driven"** is slightly more stereotypical of humanities fields, but not impossible in computer science.
* **"Gifted and passionate"** is again, very general and applies to successful people in many fields.
* **"Not particularly technical"** This is the most telling statement. It *could* suggest he's less likely to be in computer science. However,  within a university setting, even humanities professors need some technical proficiency (digital research, software use, etc.).  

**Important Note:** This is highly speculative. The description is too vague for a confident probability estimate.  A larger sample size for computer science professors might have revealed if "not particularly technical" is truly unusual for that group.
