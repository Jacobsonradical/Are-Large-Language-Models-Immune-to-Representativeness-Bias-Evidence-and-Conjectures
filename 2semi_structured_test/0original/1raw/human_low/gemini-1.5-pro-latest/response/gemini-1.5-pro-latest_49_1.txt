{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no specific clues about his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative, but these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly selected professor is three times more likely to be from the humanities.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to computer science, the probability is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 or 0.25.**
