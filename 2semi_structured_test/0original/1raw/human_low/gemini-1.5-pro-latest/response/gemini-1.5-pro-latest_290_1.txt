{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong clues to definitively determine his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards him being in computer science (25% chance) with a probability of 0.2:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor, suggesting a field where rapid advancement is possible, like computer science.
* **Creative and Imaginative:** These traits are valuable in both fields but could be particularly relevant in computer science where innovation is highly valued.

**However, the following points counter that argument:**

* **Not Particularly Technical:** This statement suggests Jason might not be a good fit for computer science. However, there are subfields within computer science that are less technical and more focused on design or human-computer interaction.
* **Enjoys traveling, reading, exploring:** These are common interests and don't strongly point towards either field.

**Ultimately, the description lacks strong indicators. Therefore,  a probability slightly favoring computer science (due to his age and creativity) but remaining close to the base rate of 25% (25 computer science professors out of 100) seems most reasonable.**
