{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why I lean slightly towards computer science with a 0.3 probability:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor, which might be slightly more common in the rapidly evolving field of computer science.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: This statement is open to interpretation. It could suggest someone who excels in the theoretical or conceptual aspects of computer science without being a strong programmer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The humanities group is three times larger than the computer science group. This heavily biases the probability towards humanities.
* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes. The description might seem to align with a "creative humanities professor" stereotype, but this is not statistically sound reasoning. 

**Ultimately, the information provided doesn't offer strong evidence to confidently place Jason in either field.**  A 0.3 probability reflects a slight inclination towards computer science, acknowledging the limited information and potential biases.
