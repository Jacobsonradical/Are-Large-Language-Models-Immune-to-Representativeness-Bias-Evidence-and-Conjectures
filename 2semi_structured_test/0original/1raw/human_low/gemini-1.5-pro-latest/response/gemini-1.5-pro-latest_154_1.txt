**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it doesn't provide strong evidence to definitively say whether he's a computer science or humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading.  These are stereotypes and may not reflect reality. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means there's a 3:1 chance that any randomly selected professor from this study is in the humanities.

**Since we lack strong evidence pointing towards computer science, the prior probability (based on the sample composition) should guide our answer. Therefore, there's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor.**
