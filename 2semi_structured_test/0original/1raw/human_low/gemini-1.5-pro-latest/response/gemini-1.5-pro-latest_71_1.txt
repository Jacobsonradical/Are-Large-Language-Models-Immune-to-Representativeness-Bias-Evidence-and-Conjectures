**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming that someone creative and not particularly technical cannot be in computer science is a harmful stereotype. Computer science involves a great deal of creativity and problem-solving, and not all roles within the field are heavily technical. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors. This is a small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about the personality traits of all computer science professors.
* **Base rate:** The study includes 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This means the base rate of being a humanities professor in this sample is much higher. 

**Therefore, while it's possible that Jason is a computer science professor, it's more likely, based on the information given and the base rates, that he is one of the humanities professors.**  A probability of 0.1 reflects this (10% chance of being a computer science professor, 90% chance of being a humanities professor).
