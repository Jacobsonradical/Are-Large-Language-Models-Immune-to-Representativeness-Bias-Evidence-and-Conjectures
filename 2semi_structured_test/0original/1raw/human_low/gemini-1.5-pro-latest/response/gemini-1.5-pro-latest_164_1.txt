{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The description provided offers some personality insights, but these are not stereotypically associated strongly with either computer science or humanities. While Jason's lack of "technical" inclination might suggest he's less likely to be in computer science, this is a weak indicator, and personality traits are not always accurate predictors of profession. 

Given the lack of strong evidence from the description, it's most reasonable to stick with the base rate, which gives us a probability of 0.25.
