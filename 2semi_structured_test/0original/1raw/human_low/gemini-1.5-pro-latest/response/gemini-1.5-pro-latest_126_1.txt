{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing directly suggesting he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative is a stereotype. Many fields benefit from diverse personalities.
* **Small sample size:** 25 computer science professors is a small group to draw conclusions from. 
* **Base rate is important:** The humanities group is three times larger than the computer science group. This means it's statistically more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.

**Since we lack strong evidence, the most logical approach is to lean towards the base rate.**  With 25% of the sample being computer science professors, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) is a reasonable estimate.
