**Reasoning:**

The description provided leans towards stereotypes often associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical).  While these traits don't preclude someone from being in computer science, the base rate of computer science professors in the study (25 out of 100) is lower than humanities professors (75 out of 100). 

A probability of 0.2 reflects the 25% chance that a randomly chosen professor from this study would be from the computer science group, without completely discounting the possibility based on the description.
