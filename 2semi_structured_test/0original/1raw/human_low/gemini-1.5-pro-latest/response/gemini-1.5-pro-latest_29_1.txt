{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability of him being in computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor. Computer science is a field where rapid advancements and earlier career success are more common. 
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: This statement is interesting. It suggests a strength in conceptualization and perhaps teaching, which could apply to either field. However, in the context of computer science, it might indicate someone more focused on theoretical aspects or human-computer interaction, areas where a less technical focus might be possible.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bias:**  My reasoning might be influenced by stereotypes about computer science and humanities professors. It's crucial to recognize these potential biases.
* **Limited Information:**  The description offers a very limited glimpse into Jason's personality.  Factors like research interests, teaching style, and specific skills would be far more informative in determining his field.

**In conclusion:**  Given the limited information, my probability estimate is a very rough guess. A more confident assessment would require significantly more data about Jason's professional life and academic achievements.
