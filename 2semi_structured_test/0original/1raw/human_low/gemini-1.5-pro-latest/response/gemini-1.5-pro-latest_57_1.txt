**Reasoning:**

While there are no absolute stereotypes, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are qualities often valued and utilized in humanities disciplines. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** makes it less likely he's in a highly technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and potential biases. There are many successful computer science professors who are creative and not solely technically focused. This exercise highlights how easily we form judgments based on limited data.
