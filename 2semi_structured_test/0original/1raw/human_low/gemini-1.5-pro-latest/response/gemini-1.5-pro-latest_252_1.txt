**Reasoning:**

There is a 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor. This is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample:

* **25 computer science professors** out of a total of **100 professors** equals 25%.

The provided description of Jason's personality contains no information about his field of study.  Therefore, we cannot use the description to infer his profession.  We can only rely on the base rate provided by the study sample.
