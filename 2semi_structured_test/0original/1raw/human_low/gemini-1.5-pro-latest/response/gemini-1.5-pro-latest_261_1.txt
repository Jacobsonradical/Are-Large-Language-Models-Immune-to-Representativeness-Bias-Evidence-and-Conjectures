{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession.  Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not be a good fit for computer science, a highly technical field. 
* **Humanities Stereotype**:  The description aligns with some common stereotypes of individuals in creative and humanities-focused fields (e.g., interest in travel, reading, being emotionally driven). 

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are not reliable indicators. It's entirely possible for a computer science professor to be creative, enjoy travel, and be less technically-oriented than their peers.  My probability assessment is based on limited information and a slight bias introduced by the description.
