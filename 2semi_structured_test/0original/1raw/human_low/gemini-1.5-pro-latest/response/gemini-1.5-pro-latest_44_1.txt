**Reasoning:**

There is a 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Prior Probability:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science. This gives us a baseline probability of 25/100 = 0.25.
* **Description is Not Strongly Suggestive:** The description provided offers some personality insights but doesn't contain strong indicators that would clearly point towards Jason being in computer science or humanities.  While some might associate "technical" with computer science, the lack of this trait doesn't definitively place him in either field.  

**Important Note:** This is a simple assessment based on limited information.  A more accurate prediction would require analyzing how the personality traits described correlate with each field based on the study's findings.
