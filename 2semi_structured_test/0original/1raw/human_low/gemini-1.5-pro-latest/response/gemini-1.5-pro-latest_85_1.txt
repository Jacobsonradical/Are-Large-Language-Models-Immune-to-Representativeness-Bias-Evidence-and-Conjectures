{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards him being a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) but these are not absolute indicators. There are plenty of creative and well-read individuals in computer science as well.
* **"Not particularly technical" is vague:**  This phrase could suggest he's not in a technical field, but it's not definitive. It could also mean he excels in other areas within computer science that are less code-focused.
* **Base rates matter:**  The sample size is important. There are three times as many humanities professors (75) in the study as computer science professors (25). This prior probability significantly influences the likelihood.

**Therefore, while the description slightly leans towards Jason being in the humanities, the lack of strong evidence and the influence of the base rate make it more likely that he is not a computer science professor. A probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects this uncertainty while still acknowledging the slight lean towards humanities.**
