**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description plays into some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) and against stereotypes of computer science professors (not particularly technical). However, these are just stereotypes and not reliable indicators in individual cases. 
* **Small sample size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.

**Considering the limited information, a probability of 0.2 (20%) seems reasonable.** This reflects the base rate of computer science professors in the study sample (25 out of 100). Without further information, it's best to stick close to the overall proportion.
