**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong clues about his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators.
* **Small sample size:**  The study only included 25 computer science professors. This is a relatively small sample size, making it harder to draw definitive conclusions about personality traits within that group.

Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence leaning one way or another, the probability is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

* **25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 or 25%**
