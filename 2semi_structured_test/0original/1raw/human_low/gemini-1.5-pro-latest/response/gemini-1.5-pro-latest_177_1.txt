{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Base Rate:** There's a 25% base rate that any randomly chosen professor in this study is a computer scientist (25 computer science professors / 100 total professors). 
* **Description:** The description provides some personality insights but nothing definitively tied to computer science. While some might associate "technical" with computer science, the lack of that trait doesn't preclude someone from the field.
* **Limited Information:** The description doesn't offer strong evidence to shift significantly from the base rate.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability aligns closely with the base rate of 25%.**
