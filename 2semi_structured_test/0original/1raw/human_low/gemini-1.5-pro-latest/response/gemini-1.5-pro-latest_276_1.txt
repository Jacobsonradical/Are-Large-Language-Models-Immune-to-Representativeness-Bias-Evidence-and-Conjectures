**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of expertise. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be attributed to successful professors in both computer science and humanities. 

However, the statement "not particularly technical" might be slightly more associated with humanities professors. 

Since the sample size of humanities professors is three times larger than computer science professors (75 vs. 25), there's a higher baseline probability that Jason belongs to the larger group. 

Therefore, I've assigned a probability of 0.1, suggesting a slightly lower chance that Jason is a computer science professor, but acknowledging the limited information available.
