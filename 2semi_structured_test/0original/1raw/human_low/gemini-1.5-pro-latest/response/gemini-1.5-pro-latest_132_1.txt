{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information directly relevant to whether he's in computer science or humanities.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" can be found in both computer science and humanities. 
* **The description is vague:** It doesn't mention Jason's specific research interests, teaching style, or anything concretely linking him to either field.

**Therefore, we fall back on the base rate:**

* There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 or 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
