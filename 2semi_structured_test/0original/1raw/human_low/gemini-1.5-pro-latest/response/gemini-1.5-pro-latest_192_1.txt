**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Traits not exclusive:**  The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, a love for travel, reading, and exploration.  These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities.  Professors in both fields can possess these qualities. 
* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase might suggest a lower probability of being in computer science. However, it's not definitive. There are areas within computer science that are less technically focused and might appeal to someone described this way.

**Since the description is relatively neutral, the prior probability should guide our answer.**  

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% chance.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.**
