{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming all computer science professors are highly technical and less emotionally driven is a stereotype.  
* **Humanities professors can be technical:**  Many areas within the humanities now utilize technology and data analysis. Jason could be a digital humanities scholar, for example.
* **The sample size matters:** There were 3 times as many humanities professors (75) in the study as computer science professors (25). This heavily influences the probability.

**Given that 25% of the sample were computer science professors, and the description doesn't offer strong evidence in either direction, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor aligns with the base rate of the sample, which is 25%.**
