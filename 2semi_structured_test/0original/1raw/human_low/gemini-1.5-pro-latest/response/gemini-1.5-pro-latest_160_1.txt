**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"gifted and passionate"** are traits found in many professions, including humanities.
* **"Not particularly technical"**  weakens the probability of Jason being in computer science. 
* **Personal details:**  His age, marital status, and hobbies are largely irrelevant in determining his profession.

**Base Rate:** The study has 25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors. Given the lack of strong evidence towards computer science and the base rate, a probability leaning slightly towards the larger group (humanities) seems reasonable.  

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 (20%) signifies a lower likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, while still acknowledging a possibility based on the limited information.**
