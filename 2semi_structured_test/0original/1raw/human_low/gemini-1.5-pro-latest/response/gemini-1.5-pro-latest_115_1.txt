{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information linking the personality description to a specific field, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study. 

* There were 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
