{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is based on stereotypes and not necessarily accurate. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.

**Since we lack strong evidence, the most logical approach is to rely on the base rate:**

* **25% of the professors in the study are from computer science.** 

Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.25 or 25%.
