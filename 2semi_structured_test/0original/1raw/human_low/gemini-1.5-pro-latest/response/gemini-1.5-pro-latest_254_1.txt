{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the lack of mention of technical skills combined with the emphasis on creativity, emotional drive, and non-technical passions (traveling, reading, exploring) suggests a higher likelihood of him being in the humanities. 

Since there's a 75% chance of a randomly chosen professor from this study being in the humanities (75 out of 100), the probability leans towards Jason being in that group. However, it's important to acknowledge that this is just a probability based on limited information.  There's still a chance he could be a computer science professor with diverse interests.
