{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:**  "Humanities" is a very broad category. Professors in fields like digital art, creative writing, or philosophy might be described similarly to Jason.

**Since the description is not particularly informative about Jason's profession, the base rates are the most important factor:**

* **25% are computer science professors:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science.
* **75% are humanities professors:** The remaining 75 are in the humanities.

**Therefore, without any strong evidence from the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor aligns with the base rate of 25%.**
