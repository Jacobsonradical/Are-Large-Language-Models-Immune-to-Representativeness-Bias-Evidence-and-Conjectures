**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insight into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either field. Here's why a probability leaning slightly towards computer science is assigned:

* **Age and Demographics:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor, slightly more common in the rapidly evolving field of computer science. However, this is a weak indicator.
* **"Creative and imaginative"** applies to both fields.  Humanities scholars need this for literary analysis, historical interpretation, etc., while computer science thrives on innovative problem-solving and software design.
* **"Emotionally driven"**  is generally seen as less typical in computer science, which often emphasizes logic and systematic thinking. However, passion is crucial in both fields.
* **"Not particularly technical"** could suggest humanities, but many areas within computer science (like theoretical computer science or AI ethics) are less focused on hands-on technical skills. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality descriptions are insufficient for accurately predicting someone's profession. The small sample size of the study further limits the reliability of any conclusions.
