**Reasoning:**

* **Base Rate:** The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science. 
* **Description:**  While the description provides some personality insights, it lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards computer science.  "Gifted and passionate" applies to many fields, and "not particularly technical" might even slightly decrease the likelihood of being in computer science.

**Important Note:** Without more information linking the personality traits described to either field, the most statistically sound approach is to rely on the base rate probability.
