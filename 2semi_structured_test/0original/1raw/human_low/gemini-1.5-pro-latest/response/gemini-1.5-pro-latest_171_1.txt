{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why a probability of 0.25 (equivalent to random chance) is appropriate:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume a computer science professor might be more "technical," but this relies on stereotypes.  Personality doesn't dictate career choice in such a clear-cut way.
* **Small sample size:** 25 computer science professors is a small group. It's unlikely this description alone captures a common personality profile for all successful computer science academics.
* **Humanities is a broad field:** The description mentions "passion" and being "gifted," which could easily apply to various humanities disciplines. 

**Therefore, without stronger evidence related to Jason's work or specific skills, the probability he's a computer science professor aligns with the overall proportion in the study (25 out of 100).**
