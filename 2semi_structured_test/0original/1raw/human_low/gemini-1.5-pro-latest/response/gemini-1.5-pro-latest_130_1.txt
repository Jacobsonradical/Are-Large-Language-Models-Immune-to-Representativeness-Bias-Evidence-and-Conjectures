**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it doesn't offer strong clues to definitively determine his field. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:**  "Humanities" is a broad category. A professor of literature might fit the description, but so might a professor of art history or philosophy. 

Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to favor either field, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that a randomly chosen professor from the study is in computer science.
