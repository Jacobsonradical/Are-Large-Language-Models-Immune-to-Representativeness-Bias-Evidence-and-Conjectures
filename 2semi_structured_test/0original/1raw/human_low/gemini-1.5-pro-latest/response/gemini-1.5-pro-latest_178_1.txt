{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study. Here's why:

* **Personality Traits:** The traits listed (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate) are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. Both fields require creativity and passion, and people in both fields can be emotionally driven or enjoy those specific hobbies. 
* **"Not Particularly Technical":** This phrase might seem like it points away from computer science. However, it's subjective. Jason could still be a successful computer science professor who leans more towards theoretical areas or focuses on teaching and less on highly technical research.

**The Key:** The most important factor is the sample size. There are three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study. 

**Therefore, without any strong indicators about his field, the probability leans towards Jason being a humanities professor simply due to the higher representation in the sample. A probability of 0.25 (25%) reflects the proportion of computer science professors in the original group.**
