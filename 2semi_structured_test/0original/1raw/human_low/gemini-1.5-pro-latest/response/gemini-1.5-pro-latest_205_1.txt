**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or interests that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Since 25% of the professors in the study were computer science professors (25 out of 100), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate from the sample, which is 0.25.
