{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct correlation with being a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** The description might seem to align with some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading). However, relying on stereotypes is a poor basis for probability estimation.
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors. This small sample size makes it harder to draw strong conclusions based on general personality traits.

**It's important to note:**  There is a higher probability that Jason is *not* a computer science professor simply because there are three times as many humanities professors in the study sample. However, without more information directly related to computer science, a probability of 0.1 acknowledges the slight chance while recognizing the lack of strong evidence.
