{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's profession in the description, we can base our probability solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.  

* There were 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100. 
* This represents 25% of the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 or 25%.
