{"probability": "0.1"} 

My reasoning:

* **Stereotypes are not strong evidence:** While stereotypes might suggest computer scientists are less emotionally driven or artistic, these are broad generalizations and unreliable for individuals. 
* **Base Rates are Crucial:** The sample has significantly more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25). This means even if the description was slightly more suggestive of humanities, the base rate heavily favors Jason being in that group. 

**Therefore, while the description hints towards humanities, I've adjusted slightly from the base rate of 0.25 due to the description. A probability of 0.1 reflects this balance.**
