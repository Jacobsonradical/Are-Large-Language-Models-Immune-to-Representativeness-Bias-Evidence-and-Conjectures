{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading) and the lack thereof for computer science professors. However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of profession. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making the probability inherently lower.
* **Base Rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is much higher (75 out of 100). 

Given the lack of strong indicators and the higher base rate for humanities professors, a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems like a reasonable estimate.
