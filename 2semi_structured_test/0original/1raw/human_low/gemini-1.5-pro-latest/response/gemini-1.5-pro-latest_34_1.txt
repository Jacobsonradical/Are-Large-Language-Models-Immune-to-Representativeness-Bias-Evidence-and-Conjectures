**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's personality description that is particularly indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 computer science professors
* 75 humanities professors

This means there's a 25/100 = 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the composition of the study's sample.
