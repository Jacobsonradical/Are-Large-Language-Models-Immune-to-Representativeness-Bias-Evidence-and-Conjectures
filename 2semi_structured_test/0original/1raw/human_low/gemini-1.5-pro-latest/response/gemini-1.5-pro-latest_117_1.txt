**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to suggest his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to associate "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical" with humanities over computer science. However, these are stereotypes and could easily apply to individuals in both fields. 
* **Small sample size:** The study's sample size is relatively small, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about personality traits and their correlation with academic fields. 

Given the lack of strong indicators, a probability leaning towards the larger group (humanities professors) is more likely. However, we assign a probability of 0.1 instead of an even lower number to acknowledge the possibility, however small, that Jason could be one of the computer science professors.
