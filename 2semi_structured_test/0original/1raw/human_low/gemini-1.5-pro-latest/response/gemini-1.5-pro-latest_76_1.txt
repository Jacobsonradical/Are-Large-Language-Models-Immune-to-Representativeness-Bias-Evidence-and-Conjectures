{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to associate "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't consider the full range of skills within both fields. Humanities professors can be very technical in their research areas (e.g., digital humanities, computational linguistics).
* **Personality traits are complex:**  Traits like "creative," "imaginative," "passionate" can be found in successful individuals across many fields, including both computer science and humanities. 

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to favor either field, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

* 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 

**Therefore, there's a 25% probability based on the study's composition.**
