**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, it offers little to no information directly relevant to his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to lean on stereotypes about computer scientists being more technical and less emotionally driven. However, these are generalizations and not accurate predictors for individuals. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some subtle cues in the description, a sample size of 25 computer science professors is relatively small to draw strong conclusions.

Given the lack of relevant information, a probability close to the base rate of computer science professors in the study (25 out of 100) is most appropriate.  Therefore, a probability of **0.1** (representing a 10% chance) is a reasonable estimate.
