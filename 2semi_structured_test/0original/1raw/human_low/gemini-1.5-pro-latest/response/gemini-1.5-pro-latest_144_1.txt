{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable for predicting an individual's profession.
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:**  "Humanities" is a broad category. Jason's creativity and imagination could fit with fields like literature, history, philosophy, or even more creative fields within the humanities. 

**Why 0.3?**

The base rate of computer science professors in the study is 25% (25 out of 100).  Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to sway us strongly in either direction,  a probability slightly leaning towards the base rate (0.3) is a reasonable estimate.
