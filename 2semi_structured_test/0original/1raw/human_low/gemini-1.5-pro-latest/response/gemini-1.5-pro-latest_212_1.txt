{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there are some personality traits listed that could be found in people of any profession, the description specifically mentions that Jason is "not particularly technical".  Given the choice between computer science (a highly technical field) and humanities, it's more likely Jason falls into the larger humanities group. 

It's important to note:

* This is a probability based on limited information. 
* We are making assumptions about what personality traits might be common in computer science vs. humanities. 
* There are plenty of creative and passionate computer scientists, and not all humanities scholars are "non-technical". 
 
Given the information provided, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) seems reasonable.
