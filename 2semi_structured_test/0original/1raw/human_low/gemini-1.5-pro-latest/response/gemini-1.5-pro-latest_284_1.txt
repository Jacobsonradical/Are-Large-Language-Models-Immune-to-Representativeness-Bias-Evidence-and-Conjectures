{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing definitively pointing towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and the arts. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities encompass a broad range:** The description aligns with potential traits of someone in a creative or artistic field within the humanities. However, many humanities disciplines require strong technical and analytical skills.

**The Base Rate is Important:**

The most crucial factor is the study's composition: 75 out of 100 professors are from the humanities (75%). This significantly increases the base rate probability that Jason belongs to that group. 

**While I've provided 0.3 (slightly above the base rate), it's essential to understand that this is still a guess.** The information provided doesn't offer strong evidence to confidently place Jason in either group.
