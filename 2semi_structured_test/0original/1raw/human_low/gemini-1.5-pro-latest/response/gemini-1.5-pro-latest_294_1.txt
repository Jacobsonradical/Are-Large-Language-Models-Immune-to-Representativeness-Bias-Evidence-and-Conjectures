{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing explicitly linking him to either computer science or humanities.  Here's why I'm leaning towards a slightly lower probability than chance:

* **Stereotypes:** There might be a subconscious bias to associate computer science with a more technical mindset, which Jason's description ("not particularly technical") seems to contradict. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  It's important to remember the sample size is small. With only 25 computer science professors, even one or two individuals not fitting the "typical" image can skew perceptions.

**Important Note:** This is a very weak inference. Without more information directly related to Jason's profession, any probability estimate is heavily influenced by potential biases and the limited data.
