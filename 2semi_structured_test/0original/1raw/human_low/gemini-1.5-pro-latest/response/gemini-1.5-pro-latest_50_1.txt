**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, some aspects make it seem less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase hints that technical skills might not be Jason's strong suit. While computer science certainly involves creativity, it's fundamentally a technical field.
* **Humanities Stereotype**:  The description aligns somewhat with stereotypical views of professionals in the humanities (creative, enjoys reading, etc.). 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid strong conclusions about an individual's profession based on personality descriptions alone.
