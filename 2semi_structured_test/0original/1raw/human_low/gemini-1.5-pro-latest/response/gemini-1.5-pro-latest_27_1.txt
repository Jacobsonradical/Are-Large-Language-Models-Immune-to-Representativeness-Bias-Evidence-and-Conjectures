**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or personality that is stereotypically associated with computer science or the humanities. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study's description. 

* 25 out of 100 professors were from computer science.
* This represents 25% of the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.25.
