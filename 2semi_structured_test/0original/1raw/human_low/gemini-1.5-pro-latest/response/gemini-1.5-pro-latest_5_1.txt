{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Base Rate:** There's a 25% base rate that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science (25 computer science professors / 100 total professors).
* **Description:** The description provided doesn't offer strong evidence to sway us strongly from the base rate. While some might stereotype computer science professors as more technical, the description doesn't definitively exclude Jason from being one.  

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are not reliable indicators. This question is designed to highlight how base rates are crucial in probability assessments, especially when presented with limited information.
