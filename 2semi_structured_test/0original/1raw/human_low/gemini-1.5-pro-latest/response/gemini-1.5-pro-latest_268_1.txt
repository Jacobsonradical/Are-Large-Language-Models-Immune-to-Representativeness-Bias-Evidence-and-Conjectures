{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study. 

Here's why a slightly lower probability leaning towards humanities is assigned:

* **Stereotypes:**  There's a common (though often inaccurate) stereotype that computer science professors are more technically-minded and less emotionally driven than those in the humanities.  The description mentions Jason is "not particularly technical" and "emotionally driven," which might slightly increase the likelihood of him being in the humanities. 
* **Sample Size:** The study includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly chosen professor is three times more likely to be from the humanities group.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that stereotypes are unreliable. This answer is based on limited information and probabilistic reasoning, and it's entirely possible that Jason is a brilliant and successful computer science professor.
