{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** The description plays on common stereotypes about computer scientists (technical, perhaps less emotionally driven).  However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of profession.
* **Humanities professors can be:**
    * **Creative and imaginative:** These are essential for many humanities disciplines.
    * **Gifted and passionate:** These traits are important for success in any academic field. 
* **The sample size matters:** The study had 3 times as many humanities professors as computer science professors. This significantly impacts the probability.

**It's important to avoid bias and base the probability on the provided information and the composition of the study's sample.**
