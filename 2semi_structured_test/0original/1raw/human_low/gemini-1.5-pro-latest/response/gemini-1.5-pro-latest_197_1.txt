**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why my probability leans towards him not being a computer science professor:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not excel in a field heavily reliant on technical skills like computer science.
* **Humanities Stereotype**: The description aligns slightly more with common stereotypes of professionals in the humanities (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). 

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on limited information and stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid drawing strong conclusions about someone's profession solely from personality traits. Many computer scientists are creative and passionate, and many humanities professors are highly technical.
