**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, it offers little to no information directly relevant to his field of study. 

Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** There's a common stereotype that computer scientists are highly technical and less emotionally driven. While this is a harmful generalization, it might unconsciously influence my judgment. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a smaller group compared to the 75 humanities professors.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to emphasize that basing my answer solely on this limited description and relying on stereotypes is not a reliable way to determine someone's profession.  A much larger sample size and more information (like research interests, teaching style, etc.) would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
