**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing overtly suggesting he MUST be in either field. Here's why a slightly lower probability leaning towards humanities is assigned:

* **Stereotypes:** We're battling implicit biases. "Technical" is often associated with computer science. Jason lacking that might push us towards humanities.  
* **Small Sample Size:** 25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors means there's a 3 times higher chance of any random description being from the humanities group.

**Important Note:**  This is highly speculative.  Personality descriptions are not reliable indicators of profession, and stereotypes are harmful.
