{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some personality insights, there's nothing inherently pointing towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel, reading, and exploring is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:** "Humanities" is a broad category. Jason's creativity and passion could fit a variety of roles within it.
* **Small sample size:**  The study's sample size is relatively small, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the general personality traits of professors in either field.

**The slight lean towards 0.3 (instead of a neutral 0.5) is due to the mention of Jason being "not particularly technical." This *might* suggest a field outside of computer science, but it's not conclusive.**

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about someone's profession based on limited personality descriptions.
