**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why a probability leaning towards humanities (75% of the sample) is more appropriate:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests a lower likelihood of Jason being in a highly technical field like computer science. 
* **Humanities Stereotype (Caution!)**: The description aligns with some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, it's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypes.

**Important Note:** It's vital to recognize that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  Many computer science professors are creative, imaginative, and enjoy activities like reading and exploring.
