{"probability": "0.2"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there is nothing particularly suggestive of him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description might seem to align with some stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading). However, these are just stereotypes and not reliable indicators of profession. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors. This is a very small sample size to draw conclusions from.

Given the lack of strong indicators and the small sample size, a probability of 0.2 (the base rate of computer science professors in the study) seems most appropriate.
