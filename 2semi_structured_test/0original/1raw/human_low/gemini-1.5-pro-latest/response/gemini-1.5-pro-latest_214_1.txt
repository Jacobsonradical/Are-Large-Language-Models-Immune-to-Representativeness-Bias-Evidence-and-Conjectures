{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to strongly suggest he's in computer science. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming all computer scientists are technical and non-humanities people aren't is a harmful stereotype. Many computer scientists are creative and passionate, and many humanities scholars are technically skilled.
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.
* **Base Rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is higher (75%) than computer science professors (25%).  Therefore, without strong evidence pointing towards computer science, it's more likely Jason falls within the larger group.

**It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes. While the description might make Jason seem like a less likely fit for a stereotypical computer scientist, it doesn't provide strong enough evidence to make a confident prediction.** I've chosen 0.3 to slightly lean towards the possibility based on the description, but it's important to emphasize this is still a guess with considerable uncertainty.
