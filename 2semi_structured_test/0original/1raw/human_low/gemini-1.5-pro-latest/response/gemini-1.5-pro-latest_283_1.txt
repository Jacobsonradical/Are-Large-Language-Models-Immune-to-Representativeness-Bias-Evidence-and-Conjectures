**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Personality Traits:** The traits "creative", "imaginative", "emotionally driven", "gifted", and "passionate" are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. Both fields require creativity and passion, and individuals in both can be emotionally driven. 
* **"Not particularly technical":** This statement might suggest a bias against computer science. However, it's not definitive. A humanities professor might also describe themselves this way, especially if their focus is less quantitative.
* **Hobbies:**  Enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring is common across different professions and doesn't strongly indicate either field.

**Prior Probability:**

Since the sample has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

**Lack of Strong Evidence:**

The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly deviate from the prior probability. 

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains close to the base rate of 0.25.**
