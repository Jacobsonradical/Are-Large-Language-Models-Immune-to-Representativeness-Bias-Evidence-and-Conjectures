{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is a harmful stereotype. Many successful individuals in STEM fields are deeply creative and passionate.
* **The description is vague:**  Many of the characteristics mentioned (creative, imaginative, enjoys traveling and reading) could apply to individuals in various fields, not just humanities. 

**The only relevant information** is the significantly smaller sample size of computer science professors (25) compared to humanities professors (75).  This means there's a lower baseline probability of Jason being in the computer science group.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.1 (representing a 10% chance) seems reasonable.** This acknowledges the smaller sample size of computer science professors while avoiding reliance on stereotypes.
