**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to strongly suggest he is a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  While there might be a stereotypical image of computer scientists being less emotionally driven and more technical, these are generalizations and not accurate predictors. 
* **Humanities fields often value creativity:** The description highlights Jason's creativity, imagination, and passion for travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are often associated with individuals in humanities fields. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This significantly impacts the base rate probability.

**Therefore, while we cannot definitively say Jason is NOT a computer science professor, the information provided makes it statistically more likely he is one of the humanities professors.**
