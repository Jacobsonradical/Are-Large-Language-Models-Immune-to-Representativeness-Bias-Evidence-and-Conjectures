**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability of him being in computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor, suggesting a potentially faster career trajectory, which could be more common in the rapidly evolving field of computer science.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**:  This statement is open to interpretation. It could mean he's a brilliant computer scientist who excels in theoretical or creative areas of the field rather than hardcore programming. 

However, the description also allows for Jason to be in the humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**:  These traits are often associated with fields like literature, history, or philosophy. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are highly creative individuals in technical fields and extremely technical individuals within the humanities.  

**With limited information, a probability of 0.3 (slightly favoring computer science) seems reasonable, but it remains a guess with considerable uncertainty.**
