**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that is specifically indicative of whether Jason is in computer science or humanities.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that any randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science.
