**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that is particularly indicative of Jason being in computer science or humanities.  Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25% of the total sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75% of the total sample.

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply his representation in the original sample, which is **25% or 0.25**.
