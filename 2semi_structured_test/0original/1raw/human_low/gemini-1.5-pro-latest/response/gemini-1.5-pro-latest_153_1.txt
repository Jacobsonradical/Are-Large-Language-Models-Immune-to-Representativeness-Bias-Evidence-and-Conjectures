{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some personality insights, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place Jason in either field. Here's why my probability leans slightly towards computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor. Computer science, being a younger field than many humanities disciplines, might see faster career progression.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: This statement hints at a potential contradiction. While not a rule, strong technical skills are often associated with computer science. However, this could also describe someone in a humanities field that requires less technical expertise. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making generalizations difficult.
* **Bias:** The descriptions are based on interpretations of personality tests, which can be subjective.
* **Lack of Hard Data:**  Information about Jason's research interests, publication record, or teaching experience would be far more indicative of his field than personality alone.

**In conclusion:**  Given the limited information, a slight lean towards computer science (0.2 probability) seems reasonable. However, it's crucial to emphasize the lack of strong evidence and the potential for bias in this assessment.
