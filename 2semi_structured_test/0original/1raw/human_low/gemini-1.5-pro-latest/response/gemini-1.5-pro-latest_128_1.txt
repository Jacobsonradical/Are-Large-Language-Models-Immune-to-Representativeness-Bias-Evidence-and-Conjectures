**Reasoning:**

While there's no information in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are characteristics often linked to fields like literature, art, or philosophy. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** makes it seem less likely he's in a highly technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes. There are many creative and emotionally driven computer science professors, and the description offers limited information. A 10% probability acknowledges it's possible, but less likely based on the provided profile.
