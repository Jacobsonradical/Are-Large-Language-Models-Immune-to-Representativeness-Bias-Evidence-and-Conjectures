**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are qualities often valued and nurtured in humanities disciplines.
* **"Not particularly technical"** suggests a potential contrast with the typical stereotype of a computer scientist.

It's important to note that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential biases.  There are certainly creative and emotionally driven computer scientists, and "technical" encompasses a broad spectrum. 

However, given the base rate of 75 humanities professors versus 25 computer science professors in the study, the description skews the probability towards Jason being in the larger group.
