{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable for individual assessment. 
* **Description emphasizes creativity:** The description highlights Jason's creativity, imagination, and passion. These traits can be found in both computer science and humanities. 
* **"Not particularly technical" is vague:** This phrase is open to interpretation. It could mean he struggles with highly technical aspects of computer science, or it could simply mean he prefers a less technical area within his field.

**Why 0.3?**

Given the lack of strong indicators, a probability leaning slightly towards Jason being in humanities (0.3 probability for computer science) seems reasonable. This is based purely on the larger sample size of humanities professors (75 vs. 25), making it statistically more likely he belongs to that group. 

**Important Note:** This is an educated guess based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on stereotypes when assessing someone's profession from personality descriptions.
