**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to associate "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical" with humanities rather than computer science. However, these are broad generalizations and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. 
* **Individual variation:** There's a wide range of personalities within both computer science and humanities. Many successful computer scientists are creative and imaginative, and many humanities professors are technically skilled.
* **Base rate:**  The sample size is important. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means the base rate for a randomly chosen professor being in humanities is higher. 

**Therefore, while it's impossible to be certain,  a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems more reasonable than a higher probability given the limited information and the study's composition.**
