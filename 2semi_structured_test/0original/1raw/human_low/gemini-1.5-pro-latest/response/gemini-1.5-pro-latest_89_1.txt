{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.  

The description provided offers some personality insights but nothing that strongly indicates Jason's field. While certain traits might be stereotypically associated with one field or another, these stereotypes are unreliable for determining an individual's profession.  

**Therefore, without any strong evidence from the description to adjust the prior, the probability remains 0.25.**
