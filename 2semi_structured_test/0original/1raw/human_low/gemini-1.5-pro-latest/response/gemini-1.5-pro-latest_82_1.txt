**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers no concrete information directly related to his field of study. 

The crucial piece of information is the composition of the study:

* **75** Humanities professors

This means there's a **25% (25/100)** chance that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in Computer Science, regardless of their personality description.
