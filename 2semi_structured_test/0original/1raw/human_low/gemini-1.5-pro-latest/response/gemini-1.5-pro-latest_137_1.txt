{"probability": "0.25"} 
 
**Reasoning:**

The description of Jason provides no clear indication of whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could apply to individuals in either field.  

Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.

This translates to a 25% probability that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
