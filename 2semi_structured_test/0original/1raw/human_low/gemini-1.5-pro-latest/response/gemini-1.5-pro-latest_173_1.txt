{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insight into Jason's personality, it provides no strong indicators of his field of study.  

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** It's tempting to lean on stereotypes about computer science professors being more technical and less emotionally driven. However, these are broad generalizations and may not accurately reflect individual personalities. 
* **Base Rate is crucial:** The most important factor to consider is the base rate.  Out of the 100 professors, only 25 (25%) are in computer science. This prior probability should heavily influence our estimate.

**Therefore, without any strong evidence pointing towards computer science, a probability close to the base rate of 25% (0.25) is the most reasonable.**
