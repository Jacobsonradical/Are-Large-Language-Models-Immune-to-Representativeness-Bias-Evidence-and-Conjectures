{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  The description plays on common stereotypes of computer scientists being more technical and less emotionally driven. However, these are just stereotypes and not reliable indicators of profession.
* **Humanities fields are broad:** The humanities encompass a wide range of disciplines (literature, history, philosophy, etc.) that often value creativity, imagination, and exploration â€“ traits attributed to Jason. 
* **Sample Size:**  The sample size is important. There are three times as many humanities professors in the study as computer science professors.

**Therefore, while it's impossible to be certain, it's statistically more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors.**  A probability of 0.2 (or 20%) reflects the fact that he *could* be a computer science professor, but it's less probable given the information and the study's composition.
