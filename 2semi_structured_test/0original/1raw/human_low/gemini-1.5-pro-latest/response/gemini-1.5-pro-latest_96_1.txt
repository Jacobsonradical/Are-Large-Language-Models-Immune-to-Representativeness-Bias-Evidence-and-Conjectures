{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, there is nothing specifically indicative of him being a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading) but these are just stereotypes, not definitive indicators.
* **Small sample size:** The study only looked at 25 computer science professors, which is a small sample size to draw strong conclusions from. 
* **Base rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is much higher (75 out of 100).  Therefore, it's statistically more likely that Jason falls into the larger group.

**Given the information provided, and the lack of strong indicators either way, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 25/100 = 0.25.**
