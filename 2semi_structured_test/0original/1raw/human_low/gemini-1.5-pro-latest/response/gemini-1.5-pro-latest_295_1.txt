{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"gifted and passionate"** are traits found in both fields, but they might be slightly more stereotypical of humanities professors. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** could suggest he's not in computer science, but it's not definitive. Many humanities fields require technical skills, and some computer science areas are less technically focused.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:**  The most crucial factor is the base rate. There were 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study. This significantly influences the probability.
* **Limited Information:** The description is relatively vague. We don't know about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or specific achievements, which could offer stronger clues.

**Conclusion:**

Given the base rate and the lack of strong indicators for either field, a probability of 0.3 (slightly favoring computer science due to the vagueness regarding "technical") seems like a reasonable estimate. However, it's essential to remember that this is based on limited information.
