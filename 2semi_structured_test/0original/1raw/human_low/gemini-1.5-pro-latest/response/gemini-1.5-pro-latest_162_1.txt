**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession. 

Here's why the probability is likely low:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to rely on stereotypes about computer scientists (logical, technical) vs. humanities professors (creative, emotionally driven). However, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and can be misleading. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study has only 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw conclusions from.
* **Base Rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study (75 out of 100) is significantly higher than computer science professors (25 out of 100).  Therefore, it's statistically more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.

**While a 0.1 probability doesn't rule out Jason being a computer science professor, it acknowledges the limited information and the higher likelihood of him being in the humanities based on the study's composition.**
