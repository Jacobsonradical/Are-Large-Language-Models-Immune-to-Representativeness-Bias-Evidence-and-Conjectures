{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study.  Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to associate "creative and imaginative" or "not particularly technical" with humanities more than computer science. However, these are stereotypes and can be misleading. There are many creative and less technically-focused individuals within computer science (think UI/UX design, theoretical computer science, etc.). 
* **Base Rates:** The sample size is important. There are three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study.  This means the prior probability of any random professor being in computer science is already lower (25%).

**Therefore, without stronger indicators related to his field, a probability slightly below the base rate of 0.25 (25%) seems reasonable.**
