**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's personality that is inherently indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description highlights traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, passion for travel and reading, and lack of technical focus. These traits can be found in individuals across various fields, including both computer science and the humanities.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
