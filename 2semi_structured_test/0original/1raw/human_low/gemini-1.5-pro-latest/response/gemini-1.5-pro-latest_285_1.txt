**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in humanities pursuits. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable predictors.
* **Description leans towards humanities:**  The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, reading, and exploration. These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, are often associated with fields like literature, philosophy, or history. 
* **Lack of technical emphasis:** The phrase "though not particularly technical" further suggests a field outside of computer science.

**Important Note:** My probability is a very rough estimate.  Without more information about how the personality tests relate to specific fields, it's impossible to be precise.
