{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study.  

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description might align with some stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of actual profession. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study involves a relatively small sample size, particularly for computer science professors (only 25). This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions based on personality alone.

Given the lack of strong evidence, a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems reasonable. This reflects a slight bias towards Jason being in the humanities due to the larger sample size from that field, but acknowledges the significant uncertainty.
