**Reasoning:**

While there are no absolute stereotypes, the description leans towards traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**: These traits are often valued in humanities fields like literature, art, and philosophy.
* **"Not particularly technical"**: This statement directly suggests a lower likelihood of being in a technical field like computer science. 

It's important to note that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential biases. There are certainly creative and emotionally driven computer scientists, and the sample size is relatively small.  However, given the information provided, a probability of **0.1 (10%)** seems reasonable.
