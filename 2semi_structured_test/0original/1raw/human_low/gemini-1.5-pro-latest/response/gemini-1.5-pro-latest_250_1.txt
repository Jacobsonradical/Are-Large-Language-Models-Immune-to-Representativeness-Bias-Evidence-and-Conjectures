{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason, there's nothing in it that strongly indicates whether he's in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming traits like "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical" automatically point towards humanities is relying on stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are highly creative and imaginative, and many humanities scholars require and possess strong technical skills (e.g., digital humanities, computational linguistics).
* **Base rates are important:** The sample has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a 25% (25/100) baseline probability of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science.

**Since the description offers no specific clues to outweigh the base rate, the probability remains at the original proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
