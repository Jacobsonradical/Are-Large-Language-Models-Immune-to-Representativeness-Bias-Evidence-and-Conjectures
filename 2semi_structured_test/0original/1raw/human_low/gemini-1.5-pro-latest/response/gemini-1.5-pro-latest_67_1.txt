**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers very little to suggest a strong likelihood of him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description leans into some general stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) but these are not universally true, nor are they mutually exclusive with being in computer science.
* **Technical Skill Not Mentioned:**  The description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical." While not all computer science professors are necessarily coding whizzes, technical aptitude is generally a strong asset in the field. 
* **Base Rates Matter:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means it's three times more likely Jason is in the humanities based purely on the sample composition. 

**Important Note:** My probability is low but not zero. It's possible Jason found a niche in computer science that doesn't require heavy technical skills (e.g., computer science education, human-computer interaction). However, the information given makes it more likely he's one of the humanities professors.
