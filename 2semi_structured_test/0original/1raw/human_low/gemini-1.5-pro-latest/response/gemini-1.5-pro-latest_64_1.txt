**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators.
* **Individual variation:**  There is a wide range of personalities within both computer science and humanities fields. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.

**Since the description doesn't offer strong evidence leaning one way or the other, the baseline probability should reflect the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 25 out of 100.**
