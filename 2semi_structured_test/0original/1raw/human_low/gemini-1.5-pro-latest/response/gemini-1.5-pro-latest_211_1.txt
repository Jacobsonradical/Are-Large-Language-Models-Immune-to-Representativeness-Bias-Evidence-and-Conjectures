{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing directly suggesting he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities.  Here's why:

* **Personality traits:**  The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a passion for travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are not exclusive to either field. 
* **"Not particularly technical"**: This statement might suggest a lower probability of being in computer science. However, it's not definitive. There are humanities fields requiring technical skills, and some computer science areas are less technically focused.
* **Base Rates:** The most important factor is the sample composition. There are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a 3 times higher chance (75/100 = 0.75) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities than from computer science (25/100 = 0.25). 

**Therefore, without further information, the probability leans towards Jason being a humanities professor due to the base rate.**
