{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information that is stereotypically associated with computer science. 

Here's why:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"gifted and passionate"** are traits found in many professions, not just computer science.
* **"Not particularly technical"** might be seen as slightly less common in a computer science professor. 
* **"Emotionally driven"** could be interpreted in various ways and doesn't strongly point towards either field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. This response is based on general perceptions and not on the reality that many successful computer scientists are creative, emotionally intelligent, and may not fit the "typical" mold. 

Since the sample has significantly more humanities professors (75%) than computer science professors (25%), the prior probability leans heavily towards Jason being in the humanities. The description, while not conclusive, doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly shift the probability towards computer science.
