{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, there is nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading) and against stereotypes about computer science professors (not particularly technical). However, these are just stereotypes and do not hold true for all individuals in those fields.
* **Small sample size:**  The study only looked at 25 computer science professors, making it a relatively small sample size to draw strong conclusions from.
* **Base rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is much higher (75%) than computer science professors (25%).  This prior probability significantly influences the overall likelihood.

**Therefore, while it's possible Jason is a computer science professor, the information given makes it more likely he is one of the humanities professors.**  A probability of 0.1 reflects this - it's a low probability, acknowledging the possibility but leaning towards the more likely scenario based on the available data.
