{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some personality insights, there's nothing directly suggesting Jason is in computer science. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys travel/reading/exploring) can be found in both fields.

Therefore, we fall back to the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% chance (or 0.25 probability) that any randomly chosen professor from this group is in computer science.
