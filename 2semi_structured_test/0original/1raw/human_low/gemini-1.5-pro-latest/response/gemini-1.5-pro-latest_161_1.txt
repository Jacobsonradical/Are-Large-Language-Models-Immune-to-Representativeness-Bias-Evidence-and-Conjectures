{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability of him being in computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor, which is slightly more common in rapidly evolving fields like computer science. 
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: This statement is open to interpretation. It could suggest a strength in theoretical computer science or a focus on computational aspects within humanities (digital humanities, computational linguistics).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:**  The study's sample size is small, limiting the ability to draw strong conclusions.
* **Stereotyping:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many computer scientists are creative and enjoy activities like traveling and reading.  

**Conclusion:**

The information provided doesn't offer strong evidence to definitively place Jason in either field. My probability of 0.3 reflects a slight leaning based on limited information, acknowledging the possibility that he could be in either computer science or humanities.
