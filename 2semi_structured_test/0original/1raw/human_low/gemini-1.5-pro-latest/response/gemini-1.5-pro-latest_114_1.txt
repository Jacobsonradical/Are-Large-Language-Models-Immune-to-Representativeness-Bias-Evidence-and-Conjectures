**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not be a good fit for computer science, a field that often demands strong technical skills. 
* **Humanities Stereotype**:  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", "emotionally driven", and interests in "traveling, reading, and exploring" align more commonly with stereotypical perceptions of humanities professors.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There are many creative and successful computer scientists who don't fit the typical mold.
