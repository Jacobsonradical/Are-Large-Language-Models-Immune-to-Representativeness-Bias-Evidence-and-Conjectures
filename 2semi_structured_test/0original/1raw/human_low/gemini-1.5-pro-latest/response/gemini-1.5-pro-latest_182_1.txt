{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability of him being in computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor. Computer science, as a field, tends to have a faster career trajectory compared to some humanities disciplines.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**: This statement is open to interpretation. It could suggest a strength in theoretical computer science or a focus on human-computer interaction, areas where technical skills might be less emphasized than, say, systems programming.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bias:** My reasoning might be influenced by stereotypes about computer science and humanities scholars. 
* **Limited Information:** The description is quite brief.  Factors like research interests, teaching style, and specific personality test results would provide a much clearer picture.

**Therefore, my probability of 0.3 is a tentative estimate based on limited information and should be interpreted with caution.**
