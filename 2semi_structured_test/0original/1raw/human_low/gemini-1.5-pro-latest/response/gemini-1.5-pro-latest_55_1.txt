{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study.  

Here's why a slightly lower probability leaning towards humanities might be considered:

* **Stereotypes:** There's a common (though often inaccurate) stereotype of computer science professors being more technically-minded and less focused on emotional aspects.  The description emphasizes Jason's creativity, emotional drive, and lack of strong technical inclination. 
* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This base rate significantly influences the probability.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypes. This answer leans slightly towards humanities due to the base rate and the provided description, but there's still a reasonable chance Jason could be a computer science professor.
