{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why I lean towards a slightly lower probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase suggests Jason might not be drawn to the highly technical nature of computer science. 
* **"Creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven"**: These traits are often associated with humanities fields, though they can be present in computer scientists as well.

**Important Note:** This is a very basic assessment based on limited information. The actual probability could be different. Many computer scientists are creative and emotionally driven, and many humanities professors are highly technical.
