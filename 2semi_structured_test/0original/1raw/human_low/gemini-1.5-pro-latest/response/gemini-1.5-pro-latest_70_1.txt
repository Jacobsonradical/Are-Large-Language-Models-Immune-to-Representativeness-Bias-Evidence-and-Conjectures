**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why a probability leaning towards 0.2 (representing the 25% chance he's in computer science) is more likely:

* **Base Rate:** The most significant factor is the study's composition. There's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor simply because only 25 out of the 100 participants specialize in that field. 
* **Stereotypes are Unreliable:** The description plays into some general stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading, etc.). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of actual profession.
* **Lack of "Technical" Descriptor:** The phrase "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is a single phrase and doesn't definitively exclude him from the field.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions based on limited information and stereotypes. This response leans towards the base rate as the most statistically sound approach given the lack of strong evidence.
