{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is stereotypically associated with computer science or the humanities. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study description. 

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
