**Reasoning:**

There is a 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor. This is because there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, making the base rate of a professor being in computer science 25/100 = 0.25. 

**Important Note:** The personality description is irrelevant in this scenario.  We should not let the stereotypes associated with personality traits influence our judgment of Jason's profession. The sample size is relatively small, and the provided description doesn't offer any concrete evidence to override the base rate probability.
