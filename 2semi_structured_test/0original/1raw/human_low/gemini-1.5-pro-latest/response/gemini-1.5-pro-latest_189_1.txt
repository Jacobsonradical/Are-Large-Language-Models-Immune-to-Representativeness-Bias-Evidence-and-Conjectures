**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information that is stereotypically predictive of a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **The Stereotype:** There's a common stereotype that computer science professors are more technical and less emotionally driven. While this is a vast generalization and not necessarily accurate, it plays a role in the probability assessment.
* **Base Rate:** The sample has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a 25% (25/100) base rate for a randomly chosen professor to be in computer science.
* **Description is Weakly Suggestive:** The description leans slightly *away* from the computer science stereotype ("not particularly technical", "emotionally driven"). 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.  This answer uses the stereotype to address the probability question, but it's essential to remember that personality traits are not reliable indicators of someone's profession.
