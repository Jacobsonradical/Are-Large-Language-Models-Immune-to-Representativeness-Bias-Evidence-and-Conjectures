{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"gifted and passionate"** are traits found in both fields, though perhaps more stereotypically associated with humanities.
* **"Not particularly technical"** slightly leans towards humanities. However,  computer science is a broad field, and not all roles require deep technical expertise. 
* **Age, marital status, and hobbies** are not particularly informative for this specific question. 

**Important Note:** This is a very weak prediction.  The description is simply not detailed enough to make a confident judgment about Jason's profession.  A true probability would require a much deeper analysis of the personality traits and their correlation with different academic fields.
