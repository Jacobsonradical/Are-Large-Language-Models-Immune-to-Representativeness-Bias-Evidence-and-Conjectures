**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why a low probability leaning towards humanities is assigned:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not be drawn to a field heavily reliant on technical skills like computer science.
* **Humanities Stereotype (weak indicator):**  The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and interest in travel, reading, and exploring. While not definitive, these traits might be stereotypically associated with humanities more than computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  Many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and enjoy activities mentioned. The provided description is insufficient for a confident prediction.  The lower probability assigned merely reflects a slight leaning based on limited information.
