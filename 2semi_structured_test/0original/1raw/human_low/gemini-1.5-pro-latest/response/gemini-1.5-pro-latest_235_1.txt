{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards a higher probability of him being in humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**: These traits, while present in both fields, are often more pronounced and valued in humanities disciplines.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**:  The "not particularly technical" comment suggests a potential lean away from computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a very weak signal.  There are plenty of creative and passionate computer scientists, and the description doesn't rule out technical proficiency. My probability leans slightly towards humanities based on common stereotypes, which are not always accurate.
