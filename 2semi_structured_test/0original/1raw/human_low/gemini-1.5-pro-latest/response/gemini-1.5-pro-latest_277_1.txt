{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Base Rate:** There is a 25% base rate of Jason being a computer science professor (25 computer science professors out of 100 total).
* **Stereotypes:** The description aligns somewhat with stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) and less so with stereotypes of computer science professors (often associated with technical skills). 
* **Weak Evidence:** However, these stereotypes are not strong enough to drastically shift the probability away from the base rate.  Many computer science professors are also creative and enjoy reading. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on stereotypes.  While the description might lean towards a humanities professor, the base rate is essential information and should not be ignored.
