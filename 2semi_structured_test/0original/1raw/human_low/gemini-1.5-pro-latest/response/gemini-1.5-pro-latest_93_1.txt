{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information directly relevant to his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be found in individuals from various backgrounds, including both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, the most logical approach is to rely on the base rate provided in the study.  25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science. This translates to a 25% probability, or 0.25.
