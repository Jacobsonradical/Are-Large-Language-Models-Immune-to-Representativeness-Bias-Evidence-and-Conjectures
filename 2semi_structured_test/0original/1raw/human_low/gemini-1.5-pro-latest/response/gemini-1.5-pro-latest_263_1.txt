**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

The description provides no strong indicators of Jason's field. While some might stereotype computer science as more "technical", the description doesn't definitively say Jason *lacks* technical skills, just that it's not his most prominent trait. 

Without more information relevant to differentiating computer science from humanities, the best estimate remains the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
