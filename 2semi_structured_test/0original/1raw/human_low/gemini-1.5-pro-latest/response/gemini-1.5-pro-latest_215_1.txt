{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession.  Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests a lower likelihood of being in a highly technical field like computer science.
* **Humanities Stereotype (Weak)**: Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" might be stereotypically associated more with humanities fields. However, this is a weak indicator as these traits can be found in many professions.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information. This assessment is based on a very limited profile and stereotypical assumptions should be avoided in real-world scenarios.
