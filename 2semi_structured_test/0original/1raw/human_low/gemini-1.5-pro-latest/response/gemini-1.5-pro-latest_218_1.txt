{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively rules out Jason being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are qualities frequently linked to artistic and humanistic pursuits. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** makes it seem less likely he's in a highly technical field like computer science.

It's important to remember that this is a probabilistic judgment. There are certainly creative and less technically-minded computer science professors out there. However, given the information provided and the base rates (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors), a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems like a reasonable estimate.
