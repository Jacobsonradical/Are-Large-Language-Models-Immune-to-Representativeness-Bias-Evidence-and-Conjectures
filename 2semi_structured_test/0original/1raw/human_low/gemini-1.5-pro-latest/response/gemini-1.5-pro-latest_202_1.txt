{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the lack of mention of technical skills, combined with the emphasis on creativity, imagination, and being emotionally driven, aligns more with stereotypes of humanities professors. 

It's important to note that this is based on stereotypes and a very limited description. There are certainly creative and passionate computer scientists, and not all humanities scholars fit the stereotype presented. However, given the information provided and the base rates (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science professors), a probability leaning towards humanities is more likely.
