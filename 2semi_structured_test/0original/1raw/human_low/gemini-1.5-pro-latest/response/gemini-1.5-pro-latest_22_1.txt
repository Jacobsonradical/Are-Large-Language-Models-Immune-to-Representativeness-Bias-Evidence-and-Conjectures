{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing definitively pointing towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming all computer science professors are technical and lack traits like creativity or passion is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities encompass a broad range:**  Fields within the humanities often require creativity, imagination, and a passion for exploration â€“ traits mentioned in Jason's description. 
* **Sample size matters:** There's a higher base rate of humanities professors (75%) in the study compared to computer science professors (25%).

**Therefore, without further information directly relating Jason's skills or interests to computer science, a probability slightly leaning towards him being in the larger group (humanities) is more logical.**
