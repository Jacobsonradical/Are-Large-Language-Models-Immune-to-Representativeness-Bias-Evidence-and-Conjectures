**Reasoning:**

There is a 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the sample sizes provided. Here's why:

* **25 computer science professors** were in the study.
* **75 humanities professors** were in the study.
* This means there's a **25/100 (or 25%) chance** of a randomly selected professor from this study being in computer science.

**Important Note:** The personality description is irrelevant in this calculation. We are specifically asked for the probability based on the sample composition.
