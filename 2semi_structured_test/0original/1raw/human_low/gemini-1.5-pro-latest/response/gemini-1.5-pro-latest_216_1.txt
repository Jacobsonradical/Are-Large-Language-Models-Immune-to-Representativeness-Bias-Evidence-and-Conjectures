{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or creative is a harmful stereotype.  Many successful individuals in technical fields are deeply creative and passionate.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors, which is a small sample size to draw strong conclusions from. 

**Baseline Probability:** With 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the baseline probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%. 

**The Description:** The provided description doesn't offer strong enough evidence to significantly deviate from this baseline probability.
