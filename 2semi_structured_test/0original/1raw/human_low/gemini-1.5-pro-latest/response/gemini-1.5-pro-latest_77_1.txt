**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or interests that would definitively indicate whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, the only relevant information is the prior probability:

* There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
* There are 100 professors total in the sample. 

This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the sample composition.
