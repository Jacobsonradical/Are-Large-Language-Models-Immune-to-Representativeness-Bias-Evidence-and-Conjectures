{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be attributed to professors in either computer science or humanities. 

Therefore, the baseline probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.  

* There are 25 computer science professors.
* There are 100 professors in total.

The probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
