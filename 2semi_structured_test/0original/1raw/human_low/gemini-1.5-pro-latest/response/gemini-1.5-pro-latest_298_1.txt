{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some personality insights, there's nothing definitively pointing to Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  The description plays into some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading) but these are not exclusive to the field. Many computer scientists are also creative and well-read.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study involved a relatively small sample size, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about personality traits being strongly predictive of a specific academic field. 

**The Base Rate:** The most crucial factor is the base rate.  Out of the 100 professors, only 25 were in computer science. This means there's a 25% (or 0.25) chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science, regardless of their personality description.

**Conclusion:**  Without any strong indicators linking the description to computer science, the probability should be close to the base rate of 0.25.  I've chosen 0.2 to slightly adjust for a potential (though weak) bias based on stereotypical perceptions of the description.
