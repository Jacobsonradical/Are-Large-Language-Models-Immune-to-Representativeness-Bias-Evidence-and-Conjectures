{"probability": "0.2"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information directly relevant to his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be found in professors from various disciplines, including both computer science and humanities.

However, the statement "not particularly technical" might be slightly less common among computer science professors. This single statement is the primary reason for leaning towards a lower probability.

Given the limited information and the fact that the sample has three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25), a probability of **0.2** seems like a reasonable estimate. This represents a baseline chance based purely on the sample composition, slightly lowered due to the "not particularly technical" statement. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is a highly speculative estimate based on limited information.  Many computer science professors are creative, passionate, and not solely focused on technical details.
