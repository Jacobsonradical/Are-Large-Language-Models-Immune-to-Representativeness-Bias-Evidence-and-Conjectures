{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why a slightly lower probability towards computer science is given:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not be drawn to a field heavily reliant on technical skills. However, it's not definitive, as there are areas within computer science that value creativity and imagination.
* **Base Rate**: The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors â€“ a 3:1 ratio.  In the absence of strong evidence pointing towards computer science, it's more likely he falls within the larger group.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and not solely focused on technical aspects. This response is based on a probabilistic interpretation of limited information and the provided sample composition.
