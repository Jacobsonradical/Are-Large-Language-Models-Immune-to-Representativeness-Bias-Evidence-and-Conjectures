{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators that would definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. Here's why my probability leans slightly higher towards computer science:

* **"Creative and imaginative"**: These traits are valuable in both fields, but perhaps slightly more associated with computer science, particularly in areas like algorithm design and software development.
* **"Not particularly technical"**: This statement could suggest he's not in a heavily technical field like computer science. However, it's not definitive. There are areas within computer science that are less technical and more focused on theory or human-computer interaction.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size**: The study has a small sample size, especially for computer science professors (only 25). This makes it harder to draw strong conclusions based on general observations.
* **Bias in Description**: The description itself might be unintentionally biased towards certain personality traits, influenced by the writer's perceptions of each field. 

**Overall**:  Without more concrete information about Jason's research, interests, or specific skills, it's difficult to give a definitive probability. The 0.3 slightly favors computer science based on a subtle interpretation of the provided traits, but it's far from conclusive.
