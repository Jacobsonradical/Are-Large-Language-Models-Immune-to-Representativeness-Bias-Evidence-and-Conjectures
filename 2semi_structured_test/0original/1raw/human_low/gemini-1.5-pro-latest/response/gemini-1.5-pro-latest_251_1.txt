**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, there is nothing that strongly indicates whether he is in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are more technical and less emotionally driven. However, this is a harmful stereotype.  Many computer scientists are creative, passionate, and enjoy activities like travel and reading.
* **Base rates are important:**  Since there are 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study, it's statistically more likely Jason falls into the larger group.

**Therefore, a probability closer to the base rate of 25% (0.25) for computer science is more reasonable than a probability closer to 50% or higher.**
