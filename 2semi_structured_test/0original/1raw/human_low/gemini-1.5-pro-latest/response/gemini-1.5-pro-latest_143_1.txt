**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that is particularly indicative of whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
