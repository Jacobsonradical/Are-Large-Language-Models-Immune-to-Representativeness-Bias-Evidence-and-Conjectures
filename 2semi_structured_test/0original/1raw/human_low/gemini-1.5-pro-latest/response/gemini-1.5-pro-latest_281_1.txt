{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, there's nothing definitively pointing towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities scholars (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of profession.  
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study involves a relatively small sample size, especially for computer science professors (only 25). This makes it harder to draw strong conclusions based on personality alone. 
* **Base Rate:** It's important to consider the base rate. There were 3 times as many humanities professors (75) in the study compared to computer science professors (25). This means it's inherently more likely that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor.

**Considering the lack of strong indicators and the higher base rate for humanities professors, a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) seems reasonable. This reflects the fact that it's more likely Jason is a humanities professor, but doesn't rule out the possibility of him being in computer science.**
