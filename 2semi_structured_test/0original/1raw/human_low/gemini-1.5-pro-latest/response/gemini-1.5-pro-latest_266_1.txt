{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing inherently preventing a computer science professor from having these traits, the description leans towards a stereotype often associated with humanities professors:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are qualities often emphasized in humanities fields.
* **"Not particularly technical"** is a significant statement. While not impossible for a computer science professor, technical proficiency is almost always a core requirement in this field.

The base rate is important here. There's a 75% chance Jason is a humanities professor simply because the sample had 3 times as many.  The description, while not conclusive, weakly nudges us towards Jason being in the larger group. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid making strong assumptions about individuals based on this kind of analysis.
