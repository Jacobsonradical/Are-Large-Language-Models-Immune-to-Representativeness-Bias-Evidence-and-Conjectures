{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong evidence to suggest he's a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are more technical and less emotionally driven. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators. 
* **Humanities bias:** The sample size is skewed towards humanities professors (75% vs. 25% computer science). This means there's a higher baseline chance of any random professor in the study being from the humanities.
* **Description leans towards humanities:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, passion for reading and exploring â€“ traits often associated with humanities fields. 

**It's important to note:**  Without further information directly related to Jason's work or academic achievements, it's impossible to give a precise probability. My answer leans towards a low probability simply because the information provided leans slightly towards a humanities profile *and* the sample size favors humanities professors.
