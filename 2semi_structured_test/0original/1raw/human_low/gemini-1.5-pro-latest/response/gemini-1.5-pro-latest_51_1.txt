{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is inherently indicative of being a computer science professor.  The description leans towards traits often associated with humanities disciplines (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading, exploring). 

Since 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science (25 out of 100), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply 25%. Without any further information from his description to sway our judgment, we stick with the base rate.
