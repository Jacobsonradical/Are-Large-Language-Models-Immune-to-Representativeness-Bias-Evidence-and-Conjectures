{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards him being in humanities (and thus assigned a probability lower than the base rate of 0.25):

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests that technical skills might not be his strong suit, making a computer science professorship slightly less likely.
* **"Creative and imaginative", "emotionally driven"**: These traits, while present in both fields, are often more prominently associated with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:**  This is a very weak inference. The description is largely inconclusive, and many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and not overly technical in their personal lives.
