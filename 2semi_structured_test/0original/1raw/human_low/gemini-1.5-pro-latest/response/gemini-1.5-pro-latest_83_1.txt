{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information that would definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming that a "creative and imaginative" person is less likely to be in computer science is based on stereotypes. Many computer scientists exhibit these traits, essential for innovative software development, algorithm design, and problem-solving.
* **Description is vague:** The description is general and could apply to individuals in various fields. Many professions value creativity, passion, and exploration. 
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. There were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the study. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is from humanities and only a 25% chance they are from computer science.

**Therefore, without further information directly relating Jason's skills or interests to computer science, the probability that he is a computer science professor is based solely on the base rate, which is 25%.**
