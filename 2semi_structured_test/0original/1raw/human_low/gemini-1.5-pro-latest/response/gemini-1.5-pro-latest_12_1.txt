**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it doesn't offer strong indicators of his field of study. 

Here's why a simple probability based on the sample composition is most appropriate:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be emotionally driven or enjoy travel and reading is stereotypical and inaccurate. 
* **Description is Vague:** The description is general and could apply to professors in various fields.
* **Sample Size:** The study has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.  

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
