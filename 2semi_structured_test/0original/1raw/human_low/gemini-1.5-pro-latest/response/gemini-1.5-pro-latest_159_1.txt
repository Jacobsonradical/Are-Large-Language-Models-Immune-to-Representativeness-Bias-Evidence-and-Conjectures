**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, some aspects make it slightly less likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests that technical skills aren't Jason's strong suit. While not all computer science professors are solely focused on practical skills, technical aptitude is generally considered important in the field.
* **Humanities Stereotype:** The description aligns somewhat with common stereotypes of individuals in humanities fields (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). This doesn't mean he *can't* be a computer science professor, but it slightly leans towards the other possibility.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases. There are many creative and less technically-focused individuals within computer science. This answer is based on a slight probabilistic tilt given the limited information and common stereotypes.
