**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study. 

Here's why a slightly lower probability than chance (0.25) might be considered:

* **Stereotypes:** There might be a subconscious bias associating computer science with technical skills, which Jason is described as not being particularly strong in. However, it's crucial to avoid relying heavily on stereotypes.

**Important Note:** It's vital to recognize that this is purely speculative. Without more information directly relating to Jason's academic work or interests, any attempt to determine his field is prone to error and potential bias.
