{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming all computer science professors are highly technical and lacking in emotional depth is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Humanities encompasses diverse fields:**  Humanities professors can be found in areas like literature, philosophy, history, languages, and more. Some of these fields might attract individuals with the traits described.

Since the description is fairly neutral, and we know there's a 25% chance of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science (25 out of 100), a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) is a reasonable estimate.
