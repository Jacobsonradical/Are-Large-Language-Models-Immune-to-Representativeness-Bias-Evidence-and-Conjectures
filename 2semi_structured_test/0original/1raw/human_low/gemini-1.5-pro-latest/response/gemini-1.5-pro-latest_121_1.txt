Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, a randomly selected professor has a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of being a computer science professor.

The provided description offers some personality insights but doesn't contain strong indicators of Jason's field. While stereotypes might suggest computer science professors are more technical, these are unreliable generalizations.  Without more information directly related to his research or teaching, the base rate of computer science professors in the study (25%) remains the best indicator.
