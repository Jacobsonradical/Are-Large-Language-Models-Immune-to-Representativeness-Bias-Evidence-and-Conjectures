{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no stereotypical personality guaranteeing success in a specific field, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are more commonly used to describe pursuits in arts, literature, philosophy, etc.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**  further suggests a field where technical skills might be less central than things like writing, critical thinking, or historical analysis.

It's important to note: This is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes. There are plenty of creative and passionate computer scientists! However, given the description and the study's makeup (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science), a lower probability is assigned to Jason being in computer science.
