**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why a slightly lower probability leaning towards humanities is assigned:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**: These traits are often associated with fields within the humanities, such as literature, philosophy, or history. While computer science can involve creativity, it's often more focused on logic and technical skills.
* **"Not particularly technical"**:  This phrase suggests Jason might not excel in a field heavily reliant on technical expertise like computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many computer scientists are creative and emotionally driven, and many humanities professors are highly technical. However, given the limited information and the wording of the description, a slight lean towards humanities is presented.
