**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or skills that would suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% (0.25) probability that any randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
