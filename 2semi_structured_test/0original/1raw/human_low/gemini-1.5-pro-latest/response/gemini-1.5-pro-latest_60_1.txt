**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25/100 = 1/4 = 0.25 probability that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

**Important Note:** The provided description offers some potential hints about Jason's personality, but these are stereotypical and unreliable for determining his field. We should avoid making assumptions about someone's profession based on general personality traits.
