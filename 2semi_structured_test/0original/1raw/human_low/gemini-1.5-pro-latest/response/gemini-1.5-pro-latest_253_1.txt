{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing specifically pointing to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays on some general stereotypes about computer science professors (technical, perhaps less emotionally driven).  However, these are just stereotypes and not accurate representations of individuals in these fields. 
* **Humanities fields are broad:** "Humanities" encompasses a wide range of disciplines where creativity, imagination, and emotional depth are highly valued (e.g., literature, history, philosophy, art). 

**Since the sample size is larger for humanities professors (75 vs. 25), there's a higher baseline probability that Jason belongs to that group.**  However, without more information, a probability leaning slightly towards the larger group (humanities) is a more reasonable estimate than assuming he's definitely in either field.
