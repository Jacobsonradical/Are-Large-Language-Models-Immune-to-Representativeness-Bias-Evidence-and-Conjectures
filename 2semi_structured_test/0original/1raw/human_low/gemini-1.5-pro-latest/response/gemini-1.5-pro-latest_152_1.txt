{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study.  Here's why I lean slightly towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities bias:** The sample size is heavily skewed towards humanities professors (75% vs. 25% computer science). Based on this alone, there's a higher baseline chance of any random description being from that group.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid letting stereotypes influence our judgment. This information doesn't definitively place Jason in either field.
