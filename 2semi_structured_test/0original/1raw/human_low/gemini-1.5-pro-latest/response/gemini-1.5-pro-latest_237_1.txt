{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong clues about his profession being specifically computer science. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:** "Humanities" is a broad category.  A professor of literature, for example, might be very creative and imaginative.
* **Prior probability is key:** The most important factor is the sample composition.  There are three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This prior probability heavily influences our estimate.

**Therefore, without stronger indicators related to his profession, the probability leans towards Jason being one of the humanities professors simply because they are more represented in the sample.**
