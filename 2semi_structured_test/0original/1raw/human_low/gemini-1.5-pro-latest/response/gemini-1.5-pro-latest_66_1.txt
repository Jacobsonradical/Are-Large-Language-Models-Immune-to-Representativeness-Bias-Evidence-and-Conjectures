{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to suggest a specific field of study.  Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to associate traits like "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical" with humanities rather than computer science. However, these are broad generalizations and can be misleading. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study includes only 25 computer science professors. This smaller sample size compared to the humanities group (75) makes it statistically less likely that a randomly chosen description would belong to a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:**  Without more information directly related to Jason's research, teaching, or interests, it's impossible to give a highly accurate probability.
