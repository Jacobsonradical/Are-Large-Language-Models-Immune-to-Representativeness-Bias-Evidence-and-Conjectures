{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate.  Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which means there's a 25% chance any randomly chosen professor from this group is in computer science.
* **Stereotypes vs. Evidence:** The description provided plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading, not particularly technical). However, these are weak signals and could easily describe someone in computer science as well. 
* **Insufficient Information:**  The description doesn't offer any strong evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other.

**Therefore, without any strong evidence, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate, which is 0.25.**
