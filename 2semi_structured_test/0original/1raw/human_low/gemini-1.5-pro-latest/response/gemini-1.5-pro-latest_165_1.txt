**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, a randomly chosen professor has a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of being in computer science. 

The provided description contains some details that might be stereotypically associated with humanities (e.g., "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," "not particularly technical"). However, these stereotypes are unreliable for determining an individual's profession. 

**It's crucial to avoid using stereotypes and base the probability solely on the known proportions from the study.**
