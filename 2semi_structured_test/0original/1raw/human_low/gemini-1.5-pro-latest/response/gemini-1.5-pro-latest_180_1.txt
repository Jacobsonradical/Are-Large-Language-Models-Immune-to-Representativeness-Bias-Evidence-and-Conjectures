**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is particularly indicative of him being in computer science or the humanities.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25% of the total sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75% of the total sample.

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is **0.25**.
