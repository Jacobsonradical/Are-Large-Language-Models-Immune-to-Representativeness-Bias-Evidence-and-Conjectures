**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
