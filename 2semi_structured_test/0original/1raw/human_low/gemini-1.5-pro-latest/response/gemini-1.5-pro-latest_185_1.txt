**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession that would allow us to infer whether he is in computer science or the humanities. The description focuses on his personality and personal interests.  

Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This represents a 25% probability (0.25) that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science. 
 
**Important Note:**  While the description might seem to align more with a stereotypical humanities professor, we should avoid using subjective biases and stick to the objective information provided.
