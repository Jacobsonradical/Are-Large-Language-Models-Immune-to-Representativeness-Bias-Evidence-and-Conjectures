{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description itself to suggest Jason is more likely to be in computer science or humanities.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors were from computer science.
* This translates to a 25% (0.25) probability that any randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science.
