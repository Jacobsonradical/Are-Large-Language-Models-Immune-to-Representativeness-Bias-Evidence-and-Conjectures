{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no concrete evidence to suggest whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Assuming all computer science professors are technical and lacking in emotional depth while humanities professors are the opposite is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Description is general:** The traits described (creative, imaginative, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring) could apply to individuals in various fields, not just specific academic disciplines. 

Since we have no reliable information to differentiate his field, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

* **25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 probability**
