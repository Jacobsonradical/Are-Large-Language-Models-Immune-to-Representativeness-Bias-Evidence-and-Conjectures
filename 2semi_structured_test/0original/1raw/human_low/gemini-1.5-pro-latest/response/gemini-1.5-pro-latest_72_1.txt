{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no specific clues about his field of study. 

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which means there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, a love for travel, reading, and exploration, and being gifted and passionate but not technical. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 

**Therefore, without any further information to suggest Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor remains at the base rate of 25%.**
