{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him within either computer science or humanities. 

However, there's a simple base rate to consider:

* **25% of the sample are computer science professors.** 
* **75% of the sample are humanities professors.**

Without any strong evidence pushing us towards computer science, the safest bet is to go with the base rate. Therefore, there's a 25% probability based on the sample composition alone.
