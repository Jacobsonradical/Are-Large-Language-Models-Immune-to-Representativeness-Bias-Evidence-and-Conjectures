**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that definitively points towards Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) can be found in individuals across different fields.

Therefore, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

* **25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 or 25%**
