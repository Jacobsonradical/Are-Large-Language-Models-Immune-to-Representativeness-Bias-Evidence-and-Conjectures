**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, it offers little to no information about his field of expertise. 

Here's why my probability is low but not zero:

* **Base Rate:** The study included significantly more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25). This means there's a higher baseline probability that any randomly chosen professor from the study would be from the humanities.
* **Stereotypes:**  The description mentions Jason being "not particularly technical." While this might seem to point away from computer science, it's a weak indicator. Many successful academics, even in technical fields, may not consider themselves exceptionally technical compared to their peers.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes.  The provided description is not strong enough to confidently determine Jason's field.
