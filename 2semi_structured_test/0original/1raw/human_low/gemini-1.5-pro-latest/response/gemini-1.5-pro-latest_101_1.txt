**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides no concrete information directly related to his field of study (computer science or humanities).  

Therefore, the only basis for estimating the probability is the prior probabilities provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% chance (0.25 probability) that a randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science.

**Important Note:** The personality description, while interesting, is ultimately a distraction in this specific probability assessment.  We lack the information needed to make a more informed judgment about Jason's field.
