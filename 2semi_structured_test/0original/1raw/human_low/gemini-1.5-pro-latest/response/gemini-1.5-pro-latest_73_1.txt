{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no information about his field of study.  The base rate (prior probability) is crucial here.

* There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 or 25% chance that any randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science. 

Without any information linking the personality description to computer science, the most logical estimate is the base rate.
