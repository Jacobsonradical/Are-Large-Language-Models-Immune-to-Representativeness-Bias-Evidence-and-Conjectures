{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to strongly suggest he is a computer science professor. 

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description plays into some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) and against stereotypes of computer science professors (not particularly technical). However, these are just stereotypes and not reliable indicators.
* **Small sample size of computer science professors:** With only 25 computer science professors in the study, the probability of Jason belonging to this group is already lower (25%) compared to the humanities professors (75%).

**Therefore, without further information, a probability of 0.1 (10%) seems reasonable. This reflects a slight bias towards the larger group (humanities professors) while acknowledging the lack of strong evidence pointing towards either field.**
