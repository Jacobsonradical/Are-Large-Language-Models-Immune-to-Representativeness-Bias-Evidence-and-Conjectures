**Reasoning:**

Since there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability of any given professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.  

The description provided offers some personality insights but doesn't give strong evidence to sway us strongly from the base rate.  Here's why:

* **Potentially Stereotypical but Not Definitive:** While phrases like "not particularly technical" might seem to point away from computer science, they are based on stereotypes.  Many computer science fields, especially within academia, value creativity, imagination, and exploration, all of which describe Jason. 

Without more information directly related to his work or specific skills, it's best to stick close to the baseline probability.
