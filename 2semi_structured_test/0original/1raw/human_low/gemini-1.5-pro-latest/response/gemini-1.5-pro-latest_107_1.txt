{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  The description plays on common stereotypes of computer scientists being technical and perhaps less emotionally driven. However, these are broad generalizations and not reliable indicators.
* **Humanities encompass a wide range:** The description (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) aligns with many fields within the humanities. 
* **Sample Size:** The study has a significantly larger pool of humanities professors (75) compared to computer science professors (25).

**Considering the lack of strong indicators towards computer science and the heavier weighting of humanities professors in the study, a probability of 0.2 (20%) seems like a reasonable estimate.**
