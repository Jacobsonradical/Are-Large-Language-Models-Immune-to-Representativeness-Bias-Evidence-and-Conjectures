{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why my probability leans slightly higher than a random guess (which would be 0.25 given the proportion of computer science professors in the study):

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"gifted and passionate"** are traits found in both computer science and humanities. However, these traits are often strongly associated with professions in the humanities.
* **"Not particularly technical"** could suggest a field outside of computer science. However, it's possible for someone in computer science to be more theoretically or conceptually oriented, and not necessarily highly technical. 

**Important Note:** This is a very weak prediction. Without more information directly related to Jason's research, interests, or teaching, it's impossible to determine his field with any certainty.
