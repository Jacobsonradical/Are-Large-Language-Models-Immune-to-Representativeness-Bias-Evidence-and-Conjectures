{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively excludes Jason from being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** are characteristics more commonly attributed to fields like literature, art, or philosophy. 
* **"Not particularly technical"**  This statement suggests a lower likelihood of being in a highly technical field like computer science.

It's important to remember:

* **This is a probability, not a certainty.** There are certainly creative and less technically-minded individuals in computer science. 
* **The sample size for computer science professors is smaller.**  With only 25 computer science professors compared to 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being in computer science is already lower (25%).

**Therefore, while not impossible, based on the description, it is less likely that Jason is a computer science professor. A probability of 0.1 (or 10%) reflects this lower likelihood.**
