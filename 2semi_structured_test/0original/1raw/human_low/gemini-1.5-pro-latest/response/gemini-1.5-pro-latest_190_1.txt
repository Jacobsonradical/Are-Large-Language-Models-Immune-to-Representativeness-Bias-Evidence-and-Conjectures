{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative, but this is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Humanities encompasses a broad range:**  Fields within humanities can be highly technical (digital humanities, computational linguistics) and often require creativity and problem-solving skills.

**Why 0.3?**

Without strong signals either way, the base probability is important. Since there's a 25% chance (25 out of 100) of being a computer science professor in the sample, a probability slightly above that (0.3) acknowledges the slight possibility that the description leans towards humanities stereotypes. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. This answer aims to provide a balanced perspective given the limited information.
