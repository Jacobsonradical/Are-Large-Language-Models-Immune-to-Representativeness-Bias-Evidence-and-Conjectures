{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Explanation:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong evidence to definitively say whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes Don't Hold:** It's easy to fall into stereotypical thinking about computer scientists being very technical and less emotionally driven. However, these are broad generalizations and don't accurately represent the diversity within these fields. 
* **Humanities Can Be Creative:**  Fields within the humanities, like literature, history, or philosophy, often require a high degree of creativity, imagination, and passion. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors. This is a relatively small sample size, making it harder to draw definitive conclusions.

Since the description is somewhat ambiguous, a probability slightly lower than random chance (which would be 0.25 based on the proportion of computer science professors in the study) seems appropriate.
