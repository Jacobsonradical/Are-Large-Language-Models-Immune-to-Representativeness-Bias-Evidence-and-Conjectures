{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description precluding Jason from being a computer science professor, the lack of mention of technical skills makes it somewhat less likely. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes:** We often associate computer science with technical proficiency. While stereotypes aren't always accurate, they can influence our baseline assumptions.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only included 25 computer science professors. This smaller group means the description has a lower chance of matching a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor (75 in the sample).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases. The description doesn't explicitly say Jason *isn't* technical, just that it's not a highlighted trait.  A 0.1 probability acknowledges this while still leaning towards the larger group based on the information provided.
