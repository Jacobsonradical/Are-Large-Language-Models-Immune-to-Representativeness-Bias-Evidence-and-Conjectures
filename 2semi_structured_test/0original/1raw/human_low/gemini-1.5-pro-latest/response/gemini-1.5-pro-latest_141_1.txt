**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong clues about his profession being specifically computer science. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of associating "technical" with computer science. However, humanities fields can also be highly technical, requiring specific expertise and analytical skills.
* **Limited information:** The description focuses on personality and hobbies, not professional skills or interests.  We don't know if Jason enjoys problem-solving, logic puzzles, coding, or any other activity that might point towards computer science.

**Baseline Probability:**

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the baseline probability of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. 

**Slight Adjustment:** The description mentions Jason is "not particularly technical." While this doesn't rule out computer science, it might slightly lower the probability below the baseline. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.2 seems like a reasonable estimate, slightly favoring the possibility that Jason is not a computer science professor.**
