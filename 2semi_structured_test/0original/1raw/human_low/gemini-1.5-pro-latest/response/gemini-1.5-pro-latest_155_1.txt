{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's profession in the description, we can use the base rates provided in the study to estimate the probability. 

* 25 out of 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
* This means there's a 25% chance that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.

Therefore, without any further information about Jason's actual field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
