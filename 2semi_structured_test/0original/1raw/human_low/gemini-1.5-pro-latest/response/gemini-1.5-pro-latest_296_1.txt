{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Assuming traits like "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical" automatically make someone more likely to be in the humanities is based on stereotypes. These stereotypes don't hold true in many cases.
* **Base Rates Matter:**  The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors.  This means it's three times more likely that a randomly selected professor from the study is in the humanities.

**Therefore, without stronger evidence leaning towards computer science, the probability should be closer to the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 25/100 or 0.25.**
