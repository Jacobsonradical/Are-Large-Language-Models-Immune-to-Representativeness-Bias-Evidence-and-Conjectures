{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description aligns with some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these are just stereotypes and not accurate predictors of profession. 
* **Individual variation:** There's a wide range of personalities within any profession.  Many computer science professors might also be creative, imaginative, and enjoy reading. 
* **Base rate:**  The sample size is important. There are three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study. This means it's statistically more likely that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor.

**Therefore, while it's impossible to be certain, a probability leaning slightly above the base rate of 0.25 (25%) for computer science professors seems reasonable. A probability of 0.3 reflects this.**
