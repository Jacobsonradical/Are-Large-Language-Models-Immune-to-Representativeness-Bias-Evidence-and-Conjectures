{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While there are no absolute stereotypes, the description leans slightly towards a humanities professor. Here's why:

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"** These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, are often associated with fields like literature, art, or philosophy. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** This statement directly suggests a lower likelihood of being in a technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** The probability is low but not zero. There are certainly creative and emotionally driven individuals within computer science, and the sample size is small.
