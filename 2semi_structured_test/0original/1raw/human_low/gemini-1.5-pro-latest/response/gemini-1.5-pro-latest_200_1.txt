{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing that definitively points to him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays on common stereotypes about computer science professors (technical, perhaps less emotionally driven). However, these are broad generalizations and not accurate for many in the field.
* **Humanities professors can be:** 
    * **Creative and imaginative:** These traits are essential for many humanities disciplines.
    * **Gifted and passionate:**  This applies across academic fields. 

**Baseline:**  The sample has 25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors.  Without strong evidence from the description, a probability slightly leaning towards the larger group (humanities) is a reasonable starting point. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid biased decision-making. This response aims to provide a balanced assessment based on the limited information available.
