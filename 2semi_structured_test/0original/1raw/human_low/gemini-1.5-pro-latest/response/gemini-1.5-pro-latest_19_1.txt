{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession. 

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It might be tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading, but these are stereotypes and not accurate predictors.
* **Small sample size:** The study involves a relatively small sample size, especially for computer science professors (only 25). This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the entire population of computer science professors.

**Base Rate:**  The most important factor here is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, only 25% are in computer science. Therefore, the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 0.25. 

**Slight Adjustment:** The description *might* slightly decrease the probability of Jason being a computer science professor due to the emphasis on "not particularly technical". However, this is a weak indicator, and without further information, it's best not to deviate too far from the base rate.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.1 reflects a slight adjustment from the base rate of 0.25 to account for the minimal information provided in the description.**
