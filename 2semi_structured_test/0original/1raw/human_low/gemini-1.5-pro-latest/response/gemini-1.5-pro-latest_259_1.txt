{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were computer science professors, there's a baseline 25% chance that any randomly selected professor from this group would be in computer science.  

The description provided offers some personality insights but nothing that definitively places Jason in either computer science or humanities. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys travel/reading/exploring) could apply to professors in either field. 

Therefore, without further information that more strongly suggests a computer science background, the probability remains at the baseline of 25%.
