{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is stereotypically associated with computer science or humanities.  Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 25% probability (0.25) that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science. 

**Important Note:** This approach avoids using potentially biased stereotypes. While the description might *seem* to fit one field more than the other, we lack evidence to support such a conclusion.
