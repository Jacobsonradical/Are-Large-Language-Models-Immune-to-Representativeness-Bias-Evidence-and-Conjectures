{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate) are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 

However, the statement "though not particularly technical" suggests a lower likelihood of Jason being in a technical field like computer science. 

Since only 25% of the professors in the study were from computer science (25 out of 100), the base probability is 0.25. The description slightly lowers this probability, but not drastically. A probability of 0.1 reflects this slight decrease while acknowledging the lack of definitive information.
