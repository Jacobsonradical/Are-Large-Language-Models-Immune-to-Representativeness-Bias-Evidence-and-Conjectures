Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. However, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that technical skills and expertise are usually essential for success in the field of computer science, the chances of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample appear to be relatively low.

Considering the information provided and the fact that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
