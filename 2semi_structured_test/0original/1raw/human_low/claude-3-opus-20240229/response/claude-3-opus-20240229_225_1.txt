Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. However, the description of Jason suggests a lower than base rate probability.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.1"}
