Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described characteristics, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
