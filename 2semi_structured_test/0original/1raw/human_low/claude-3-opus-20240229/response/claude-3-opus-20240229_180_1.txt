{"probability": "0.2"}

Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are often linked with humanities fields. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because individual traits can vary, and there can certainly be creative and imaginative computer science professors who enjoy traveling and reading. The description is also quite brief. But given the information provided, a computer science professor seems less probable than a humanities professor in this case. Since the overall sample contains 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, and the traits mentioned seem to point away from computer science, I estimate a 20% probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on this description.
