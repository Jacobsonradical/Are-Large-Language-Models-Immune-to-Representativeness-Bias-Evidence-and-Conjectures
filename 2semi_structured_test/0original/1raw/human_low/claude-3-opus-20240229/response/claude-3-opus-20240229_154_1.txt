Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.1"}
