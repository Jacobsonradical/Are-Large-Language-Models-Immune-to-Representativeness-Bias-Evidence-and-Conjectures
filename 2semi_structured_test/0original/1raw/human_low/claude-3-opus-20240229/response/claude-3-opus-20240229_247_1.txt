Given the limited information provided about Jason and the study parameters, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. The study has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25%.

2. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. These traits seem more typically associated with humanities fields than computer science.

3. Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical", which seems to go against the skill set usually required for computer science professors.

So based on the skew of the initial sample (1 in 4 chance of computer science) and Jason's described personality traits, I believe there is only about a 25% chance that he is one of the computer science professors in the study. Of course, more details about Jason and the other professors' profiles would allow for a more precise estimate.
