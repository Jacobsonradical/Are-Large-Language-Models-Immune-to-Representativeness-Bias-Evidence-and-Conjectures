He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are characteristics more commonly attributed to individuals in the humanities.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors appears to be low.
