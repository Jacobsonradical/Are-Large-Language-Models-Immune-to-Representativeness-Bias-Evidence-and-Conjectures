Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Additionally, the statement that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as there is still some possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor who happens to have traits and interests more commonly associated with the humanities. The study only sampled 100 professors in total, so individual variability is still quite possible.
