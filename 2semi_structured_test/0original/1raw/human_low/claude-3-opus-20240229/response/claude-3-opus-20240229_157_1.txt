Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability could be even lower, but I chose 0.2 to account for the possibility that some computer science professors might have atypical personalities or interests compared to the stereotype. The key factor influencing my estimate is the mention of Jason being "not particularly technical."
