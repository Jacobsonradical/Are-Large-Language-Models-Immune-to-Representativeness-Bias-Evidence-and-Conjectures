Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also states that he is "not particularly technical". 

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, requiring strong analytical and quantitative skills, the lack of technical inclination makes it less probable that Jason is a computer science professor, compared to a humanities professor.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, only 25 are computer science professors, while 75 are humanities professors. This base rate also needs to be considered in estimating the probability.

Considering all these factors, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}
