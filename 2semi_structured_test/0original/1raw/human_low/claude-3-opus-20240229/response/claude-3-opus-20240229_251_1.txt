Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, passionate, and interested in creative and imaginative pursuits like traveling, reading, and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that only 25% of the sample are computer science professors (25 out of 100), and considering Jason's personality traits and interests seem to align more with humanities than computer science, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
