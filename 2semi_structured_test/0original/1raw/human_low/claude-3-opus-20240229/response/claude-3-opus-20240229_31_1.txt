Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, as well as his enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key trait often associated with computer science professors.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
