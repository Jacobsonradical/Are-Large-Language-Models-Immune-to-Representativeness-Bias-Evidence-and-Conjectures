Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill for a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is quite low.
