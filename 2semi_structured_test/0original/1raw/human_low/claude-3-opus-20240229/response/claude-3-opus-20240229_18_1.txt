Based on the description provided, Jason sounds more like a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are often associated with humanities fields. Importantly, the description also notes that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.15.
