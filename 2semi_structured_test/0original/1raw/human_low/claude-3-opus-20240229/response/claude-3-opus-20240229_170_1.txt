Based on the description provided, I estimate the following probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.1"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. However, it also notes that he is not particularly technical. 

Given that the sample consisted of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and computer science is generally a more technical field, the lack of technical skills mentioned makes it less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.
