Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. The description also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that 75% of the professors in the sample are from humanities and only 25% are from computer science, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more with stereotypical humanities professors, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is relatively low.
