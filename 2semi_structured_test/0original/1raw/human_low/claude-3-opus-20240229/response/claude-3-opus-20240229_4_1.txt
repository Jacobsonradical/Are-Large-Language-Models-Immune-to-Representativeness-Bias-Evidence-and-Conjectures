From the description, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is uncommon for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and based on Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.10 or 10%.
