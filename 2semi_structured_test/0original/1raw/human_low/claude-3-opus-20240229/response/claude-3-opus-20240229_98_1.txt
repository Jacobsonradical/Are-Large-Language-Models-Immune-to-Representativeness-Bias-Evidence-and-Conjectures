Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities fields than technical fields like computer science.

2. He is said to enjoy traveling, reading, and exploring, which are fairly general interests not specifically tied to either field. 

3. Most importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical." This strongly suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because these are general tendencies and stereotypes which do not always hold true for every individual. There is still some possibility Jason could be a creative and emotionally-driven computer scientist, even if statistically less likely based on the limited information provided.
