Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
