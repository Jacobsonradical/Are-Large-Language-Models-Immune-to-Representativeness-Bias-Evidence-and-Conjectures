Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while technical skills and knowledge are usually key traits for success in computer science academia.

Additionally, the description portrays Jason as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors appears to be quite low.
