Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
