Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities disciplines rather than computer science, which tends to involve more analytical and technical skills.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
