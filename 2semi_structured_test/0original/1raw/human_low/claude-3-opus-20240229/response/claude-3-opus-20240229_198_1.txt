Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, emotionally-driven, and passionate about non-technical pursuits like travel, reading and exploration.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality traits align more with humanities than computer science, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample to be quite low, around 0.15.
