Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may be more likely to be a professor in the humanities.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability reflects my belief that while it's possible Jason could be a computer science professor, the given description makes it more likely that he is one of the humanities professors in the study sample.
