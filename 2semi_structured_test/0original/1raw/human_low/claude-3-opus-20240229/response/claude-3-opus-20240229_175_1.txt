Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is a trait one would expect to be more prevalent among successful computer science academics.

Given that the sample includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as quite low.
