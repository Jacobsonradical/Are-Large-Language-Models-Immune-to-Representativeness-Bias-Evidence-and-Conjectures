Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits that are more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it is also explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait one would expect in a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
