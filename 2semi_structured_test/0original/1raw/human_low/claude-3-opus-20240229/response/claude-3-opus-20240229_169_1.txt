Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical, logical, and technically inclined.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
