Based on the description provided, Jason does not appear to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, along with his passion for traveling, reading, and exploring. Notably, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical".

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low.
