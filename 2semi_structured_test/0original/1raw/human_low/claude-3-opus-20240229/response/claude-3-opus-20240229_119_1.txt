Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. While computer science professors can certainly have these qualities, the field generally attracts more analytical and technical individuals.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
