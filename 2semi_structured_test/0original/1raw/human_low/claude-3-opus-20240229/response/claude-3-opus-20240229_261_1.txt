Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.1"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" also suggests a lower likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, it's important to note that these are generalities and stereotypes, and there is certainly individual variation among professors even within the same field. The probability is not zero, as there can be computer science professors with these traits, but I estimate it as a relatively low probability given the limited information provided.
