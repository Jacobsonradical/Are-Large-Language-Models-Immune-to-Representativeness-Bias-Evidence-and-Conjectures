Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits and interests more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills and inclinations typically found in computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and the note about him not being particularly technical, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
