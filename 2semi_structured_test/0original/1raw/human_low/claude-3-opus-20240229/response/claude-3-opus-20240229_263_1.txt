Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative and emotionally driven rather than technical, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and lacking any other information to suggest Jason is a computer science professor, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the baseline of 25%.

{"probability": "0.15"}
