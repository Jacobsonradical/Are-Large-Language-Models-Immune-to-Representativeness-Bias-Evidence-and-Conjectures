{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. His traits of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading and exploring align more with stereotypical traits of humanities professors. 

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, I don't want to completely rule out the possibility that Jason is a computer science professor, as individuals can certainly break stereotypes. Creative and imaginative thinking is valuable in computer science too.

Given the small sample of 25 computer science professors compared to 75 humanities professors, and Jason's described traits, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
