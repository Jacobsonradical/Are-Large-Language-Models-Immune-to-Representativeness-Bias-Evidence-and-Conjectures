Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like travel, reading and exploring - traits and interests more typically associated with humanities than computer science. The description also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor. Given there were 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and the base rates, I estimate the probability he is a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
