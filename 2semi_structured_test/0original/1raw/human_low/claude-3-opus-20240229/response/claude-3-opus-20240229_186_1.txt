Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about topics like travel, reading and exploring - traits more typically associated with humanities fields. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which is an important skill for computer science.

Given there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and Jason's description better fits the stereotypical humanities professor, I estimate the probability he is a computer science professor is fairly low, around 0.2.
