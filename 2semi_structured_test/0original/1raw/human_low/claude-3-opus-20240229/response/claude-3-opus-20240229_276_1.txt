Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Computer science is a highly technical field.

However, I don't want to rely too heavily on stereotypes, as there is certainly diversity of personalities within both fields. Some computer science professors may well fit Jason's description. So while I believe it's more likely Jason is a humanities professor, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of him being a computer science professor. Hence my estimated probability of 0.15 rather than something even lower.
