Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative, and passionate about non-technical pursuits like reading, traveling, and exploring. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical, technical, and focused on logical problem-solving.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with humanities than computer science, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
