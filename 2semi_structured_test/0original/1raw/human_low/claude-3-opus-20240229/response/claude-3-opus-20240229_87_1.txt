Based on the provided description, Jason seems to have personality traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about pursuits like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low, around 0.2.
