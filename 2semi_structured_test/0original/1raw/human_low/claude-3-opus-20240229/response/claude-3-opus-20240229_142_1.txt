Based on the description provided, Jason does not appear to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering the personality traits mentioned in the description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
