Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The note that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as it's certainly possible for a computer science professor to have those traits. The description is also quite brief and doesn't rule out technical skills entirely. But overall, the details provided point more towards the humanities, so I estimated a relatively low 20% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
