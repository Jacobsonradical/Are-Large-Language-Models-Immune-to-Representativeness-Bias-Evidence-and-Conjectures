Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description emphasizes that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more stereotypically associated with humanities fields rather than computer science.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the total sample of 100, and lacking other distinguishing information, the baseline probability of Jason being a computer science professor would be 25%. 

However, considering the personality description which suggests Jason may be better suited to the humanities, I would estimate the probability to be lower than this baseline.
