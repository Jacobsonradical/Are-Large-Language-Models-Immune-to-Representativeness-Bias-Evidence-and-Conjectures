Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further suggests that he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described characteristics, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
