Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, as well as his passion for traveling, reading, and exploring. Notably, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
