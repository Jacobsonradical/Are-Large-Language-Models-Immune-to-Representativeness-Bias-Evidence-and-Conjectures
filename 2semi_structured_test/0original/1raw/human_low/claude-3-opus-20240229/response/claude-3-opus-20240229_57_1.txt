Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about topics like travel, reading and exploration. It also explicitly states he is not particularly technical.

While computer science professors can certainly have those traits, they seem more stereotypically associated with humanities fields. The lack of technical skills also points away from computer science.

However, individual traits have limited predictive power for someone's profession, so I would not assign an extremely low probability. The base rates in the sample (25% computer science, 75% humanities) are also relevant prior information to consider.
