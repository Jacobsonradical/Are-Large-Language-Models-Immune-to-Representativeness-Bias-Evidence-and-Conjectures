Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical." 

Given the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors, such as being highly analytical, technical, and detail-oriented, Jason's description suggests he may be better suited to the humanities.

However, we should be cautious about relying too heavily on stereotypes. There is certainly individual variation, and some computer science professors could have personalities and interests similar to Jason's. Nonetheless, if I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.2"}
