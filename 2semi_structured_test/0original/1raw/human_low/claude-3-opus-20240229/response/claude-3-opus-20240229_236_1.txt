Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring, which are more typically associated with the humanities. Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
