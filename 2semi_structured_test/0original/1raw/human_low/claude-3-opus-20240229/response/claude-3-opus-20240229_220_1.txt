Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. While these traits do not necessarily preclude him from being a computer science professor, they are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
