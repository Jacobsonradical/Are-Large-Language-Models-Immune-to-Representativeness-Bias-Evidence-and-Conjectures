Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven", which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that Jason is "not particularly technical", which is a key skill and interest area for computer science professors.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
