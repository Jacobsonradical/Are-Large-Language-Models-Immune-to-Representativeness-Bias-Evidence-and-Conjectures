{"probability": "0.15"}

Given the limited information provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven rather than being particularly technical, which would be more commonly associated with a computer science background.

However, there is still a non-zero probability he could be a computer science professor, as individuals can certainly have diverse interests and personality traits beyond what's stereotypical for their field. The 0.15 probability reflects that while it seems less likely given his description, it's not impossible for Jason to be one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total sample of 100.
