Given the description of Jason, I estimate the probability that he is a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The details about Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying travel, reading and exploring suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often tend to be more technical and analytical in their interests and personality. However, there is still some possibility Jason could be a computer science professor, as individuals in any field can have a wide range of personalities and interests.
