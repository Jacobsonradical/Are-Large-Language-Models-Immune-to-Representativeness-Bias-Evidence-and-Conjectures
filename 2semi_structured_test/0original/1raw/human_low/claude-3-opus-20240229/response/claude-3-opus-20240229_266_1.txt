Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Additionally, the mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as it's certainly possible for a computer science professor to have those traits and interests. The description is also quite brief and may not capture all relevant aspects of Jason's personality and skills. Nonetheless, given the limited information, I believe the probability of Jason being one of the 25 computer science professors in the sample is relatively low, around 0.15 or 15%.
