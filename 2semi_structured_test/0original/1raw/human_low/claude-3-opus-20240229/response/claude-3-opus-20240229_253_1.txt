To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates and how well he fits the stereotypical description of each group.

Given:
- 25 of the 100 professors are computer science professors
- 75 of the 100 professors are humanities professors

The base rate probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

However, Jason's description suggests he may be more likely to be a humanities professor:
- He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits often associated with the humanities.
- He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, which are also activities that align more with humanities than computer science.
- Most tellingly, he is described as "not particularly technical", which suggests he is unlikely to be a computer science professor.

Based on this, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor seems lower than the base rate of 0.25. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.10 to 0.15.
