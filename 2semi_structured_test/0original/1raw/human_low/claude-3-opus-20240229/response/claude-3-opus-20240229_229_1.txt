Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, emotional nature, and passion for traveling, reading, and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
