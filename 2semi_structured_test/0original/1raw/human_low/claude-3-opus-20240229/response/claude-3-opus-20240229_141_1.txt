Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative and imaginative rather than technical. His interests also seem to align more with humanities subjects like reading and exploring rather than computer science.

Given that the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low.

{"probability": "0.1"}
