Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.1 or 10%.
