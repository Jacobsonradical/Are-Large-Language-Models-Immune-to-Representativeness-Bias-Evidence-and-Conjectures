{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be in a technical field like computer science.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and Jason's traits align more closely with what one might expect in a humanities professor, I estimate there is only about a 10% chance (0.1 probability) that he is one of the computer science professors.
