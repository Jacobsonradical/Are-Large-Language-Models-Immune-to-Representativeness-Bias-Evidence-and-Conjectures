Based on the description provided, Jason does not appear to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description suggests he is more creatively and emotionally inclined, enjoys humanities-related activities like reading and exploring, and is "not particularly technical".

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits seem more aligned with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
