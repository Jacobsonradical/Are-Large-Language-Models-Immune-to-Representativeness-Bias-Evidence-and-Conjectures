{"probability": "0.10"}

Based on the description, Jason appears to be more aligned with traits commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring - traits that are often linked with humanities fields. Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate there is only about a 10% chance (probability of 0.10) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this study.
