Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while being more emotionally driven, creative and imaginative. Computer science professors usually have strong technical skills.

Additionally, the study sampled 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without any other information, the base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25%.

Therefore, considering the base rate and the description that seems more fitting for a humanities professor, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the initial 25%.

{"probability": "0.10"}
