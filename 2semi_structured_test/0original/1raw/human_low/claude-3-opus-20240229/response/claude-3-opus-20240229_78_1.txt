Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that are more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also mentions that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often found in computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 professors from the humanities and only 25 from computer science in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.
