Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors compared to the possibility of him being one of the humanities professors.

However, it's important to note that individual personalities can vary widely, and there can certainly be successful computer science professors who do not fit the stereotypical mold.

Considering the limited information provided and making a reasonable estimate, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
