To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the information given in the description and how it relates to the typical traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors.

The key points from Jason's description are:
1. He is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven.
2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
3. He is gifted and passionate.
4. He is not particularly technical.

Traits like creativity, imagination, and passion are common among both computer science and humanities professors. However, being "not particularly technical" suggests Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.

Additionally, the study sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without any other information, the base probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Considering the description leans more towards a humanities background and the base probability, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be lower than 0.25.
