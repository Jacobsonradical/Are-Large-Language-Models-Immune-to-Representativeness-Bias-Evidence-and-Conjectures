Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about things like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." These traits align more closely with common stereotypes and expectations for professors in the humanities compared to computer science.

Given that there are also 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the sample, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of Jason being a humanities professor before even considering his description.

Therefore, I estimate a relatively low probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.2"}
