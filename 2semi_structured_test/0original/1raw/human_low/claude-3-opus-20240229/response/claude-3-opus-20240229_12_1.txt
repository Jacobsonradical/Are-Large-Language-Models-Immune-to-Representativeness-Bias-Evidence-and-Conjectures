Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." While computer science professors can certainly have those traits, they are more stereotypically associated with humanities fields. The lack of technical inclination especially points away from computer science.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and the description better fits the profile of a typical humanities professor, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at around 0.2.
