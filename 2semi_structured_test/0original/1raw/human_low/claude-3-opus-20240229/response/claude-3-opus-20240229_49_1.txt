Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills and interests that are typical of computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as fairly low, perhaps around 0.2.
