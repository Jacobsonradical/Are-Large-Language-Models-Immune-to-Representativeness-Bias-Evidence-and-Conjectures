Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical."

Computer science professors typically have strong technical skills and a passion for technology. While they can certainly be creative and imaginative, the description of Jason does not emphasize the technical abilities that are usually associated with successful computer science academics.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}
