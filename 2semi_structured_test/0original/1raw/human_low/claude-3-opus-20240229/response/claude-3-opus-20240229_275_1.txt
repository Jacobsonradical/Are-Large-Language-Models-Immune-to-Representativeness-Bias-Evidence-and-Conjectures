Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I believe the probability he is one of the computer science professors in the sample is relatively low. The description indicates Jason is creative, imaginative and emotionally driven, traits that are more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science. Additionally, it mentions he is not particularly technical, which further points away from him being a computer science professor.

Given the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 25%. But the details provided about Jason lower that probability in my estimation.
