Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The note that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor, as individuals in any field can have a wide range of personality traits and interests. The provided probability of 0.15 reflects that while it seems less likely given the description, it cannot be ruled out entirely without more definitive information about his field.
