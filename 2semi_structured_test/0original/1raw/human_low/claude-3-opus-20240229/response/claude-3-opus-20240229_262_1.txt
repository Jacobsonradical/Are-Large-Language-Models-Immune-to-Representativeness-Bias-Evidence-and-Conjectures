{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities disciplines.

Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor. Technical skills and interests are usually essential for success in computer science academia.

However, I did not assign a very low probability like 0.05, because the description is brief and there is still some possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor despite not fitting the stereotypical mold. The study included 25 computer science professors, so even if Jason seems more likely to be in the humanities group, there is still a non-trivial chance he could be one of the CS professors.
