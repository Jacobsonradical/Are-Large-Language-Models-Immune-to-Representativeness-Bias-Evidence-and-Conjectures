Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, emotionally-driven, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate a relatively low probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
