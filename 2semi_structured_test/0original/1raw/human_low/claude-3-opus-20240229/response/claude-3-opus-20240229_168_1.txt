{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key skill and interest for most computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits align more closely with the humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is estimated to be quite low, around 0.1 (or 10%).
