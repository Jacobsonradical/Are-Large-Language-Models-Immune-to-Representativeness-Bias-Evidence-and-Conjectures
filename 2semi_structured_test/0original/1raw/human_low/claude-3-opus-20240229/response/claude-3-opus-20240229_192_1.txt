Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits are more stereotypically associated with humanities disciplines than with computer science.

However, it's important not to rely too heavily on stereotypes. There is certainly diversity of personalities and interests within both computer science and the humanities. Some computer scientists are creative and passionate, while some humanities professors are technical.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.25. This reflects the description suggesting a somewhat lower likelihood of him being in CS, while acknowledging the uncertainty involved in making judgments from brief personality descriptions.
