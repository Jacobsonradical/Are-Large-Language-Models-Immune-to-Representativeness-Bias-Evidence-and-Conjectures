To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the key information given in the description that may relate to his field:

1. Jason is creative, imaginative, and often emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science.

2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. While these interests are not exclusive to any particular field, they do not specifically indicate a strong inclination towards computer science.

3. Jason is described as gifted and passionate, which could apply to either field. However, the description also mentions that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

However, based on the description provided, which suggests that Jason's traits and interests are more aligned with the humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is likely lower than the prior probability.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.1"}
