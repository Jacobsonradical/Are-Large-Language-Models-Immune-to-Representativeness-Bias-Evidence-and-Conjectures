Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about reading, traveling and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, individual variation means there is still a reasonable chance he could be a computer science professor.

The base rate of 25% computer science professors in the sample (25 out of 100) provides a relevant prior probability to consider as well. Without more distinguishing information, an estimate of 20% balances the base rate with the slight tilt of the description towards a humanities background.
