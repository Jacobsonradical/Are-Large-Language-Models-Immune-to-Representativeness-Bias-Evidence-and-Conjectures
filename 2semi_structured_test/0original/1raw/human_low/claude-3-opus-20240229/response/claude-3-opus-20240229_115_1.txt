{"probability": "0.2"}

Based on the description, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that are more typically associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits align more with the humanities, I estimate there is only about a 20% chance (0.2 probability) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this study.
