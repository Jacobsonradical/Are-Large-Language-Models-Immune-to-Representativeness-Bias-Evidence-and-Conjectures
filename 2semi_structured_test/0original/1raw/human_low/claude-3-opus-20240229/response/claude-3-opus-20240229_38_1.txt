{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is not particularly technical.

These traits seem more stereotypically aligned with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. Computer science professors might be expected to be more analytical and technical.

However, the description is of just one individual and stereotypes are not always accurate for every person in a field. There is still some possibility Jason could be a computer science professor.

Given there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and Jason's description seems more humanities-oriented, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is around 0.25 (25%).
