Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading and exploring - traits more typically associated with humanities fields. Importantly, it also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which is atypical for a computer science professor.

Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I estimate the probability he is a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.2"}
