Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven rather than being particularly technical, which would be more commonly associated with a computer science background.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
