Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading, and exploring, while being "not particularly technical", seems more stereotypically aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, individual traits and interests vary widely, so there is still a non-negligible chance he could be a computer science professor. Without more specific information, I'd put the probability at around 15% that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
