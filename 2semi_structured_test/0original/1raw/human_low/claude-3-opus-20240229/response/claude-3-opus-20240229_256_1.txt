{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than the computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities fields.

Additionally, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate there is only about a 15% chance that he is one of the computer science professors.
