Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait often associated with computer science professionals.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
