{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is a creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven individual who enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science.

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical," which further decreases the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.15 (or 15%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
