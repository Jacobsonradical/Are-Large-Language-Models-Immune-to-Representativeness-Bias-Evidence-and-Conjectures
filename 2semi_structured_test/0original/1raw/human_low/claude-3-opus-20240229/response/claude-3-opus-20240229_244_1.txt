Based on the description provided, Jason's personality traits and interests seem to align more closely with those typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often found in computer science professors.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
