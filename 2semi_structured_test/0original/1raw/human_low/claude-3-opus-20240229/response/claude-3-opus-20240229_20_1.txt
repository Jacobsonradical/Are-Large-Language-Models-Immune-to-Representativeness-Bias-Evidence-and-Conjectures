Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description explicitly mentions Jason's lack of technical inclination, the probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample appears to be quite low.

However, it's important to note that individual characteristics can vary, and there's a small possibility that Jason could still be a computer science professor despite not fitting the stereotypical mold.

Considering these factors, my estimate for the probability is:

{"probability": "0.15"}
