Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also mentions that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
