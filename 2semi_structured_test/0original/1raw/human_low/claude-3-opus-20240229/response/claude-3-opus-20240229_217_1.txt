Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
