Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than in technical fields like computer science.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is likely to be low.
