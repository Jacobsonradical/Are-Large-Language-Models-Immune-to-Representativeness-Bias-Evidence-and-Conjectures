Based on the brief description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. A few key details suggest this:

1) He is described as "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven" which are traits more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science.

2) His hobbies of traveling, reading, and exploring align more with humanities interests. 

3) Most tellingly, the description explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a tenured computer science professor.

Given the 1:3 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, and the description skewing heavily toward humanities traits, I would estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.15"}

That is, only around a 15% chance based on the limited information provided. Of course, more details about his research focus, publication record, teaching, etc. would allow for a more precise estimate. But the description paints a portrait fitting a humanities professor much more than a computer science one.
