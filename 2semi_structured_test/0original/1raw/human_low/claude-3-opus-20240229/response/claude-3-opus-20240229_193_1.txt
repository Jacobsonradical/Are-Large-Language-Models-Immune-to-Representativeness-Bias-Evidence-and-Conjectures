Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits and interests more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that suggest an affinity for the arts and humanities. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which is atypical for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25%. However, the specific details in Jason's description strongly suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.1"}
