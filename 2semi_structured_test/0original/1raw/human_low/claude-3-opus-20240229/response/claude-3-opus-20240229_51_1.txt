Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. However, the details in Jason's description point more towards the humanities.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the base rate of 25%, but not zero since there is still some possibility.
