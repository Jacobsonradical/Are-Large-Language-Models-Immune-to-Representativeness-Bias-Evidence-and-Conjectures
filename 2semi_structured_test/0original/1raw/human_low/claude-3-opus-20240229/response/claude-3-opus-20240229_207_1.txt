Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about topics like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait for computer science professors.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and the fact that he is not particularly technical, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
