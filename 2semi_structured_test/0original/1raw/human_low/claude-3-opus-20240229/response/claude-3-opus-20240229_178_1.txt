Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits and interests more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are often linked with humanities fields. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and the fact he is said to not be very technical, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.15.
