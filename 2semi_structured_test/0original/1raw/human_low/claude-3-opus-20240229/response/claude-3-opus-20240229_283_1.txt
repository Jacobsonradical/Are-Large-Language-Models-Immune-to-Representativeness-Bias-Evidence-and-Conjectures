Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

Additionally, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as there can certainly be computer science professors who break the stereotypical mold and align with Jason's described traits. The probability is low based on the limited information provided, but not impossible.
