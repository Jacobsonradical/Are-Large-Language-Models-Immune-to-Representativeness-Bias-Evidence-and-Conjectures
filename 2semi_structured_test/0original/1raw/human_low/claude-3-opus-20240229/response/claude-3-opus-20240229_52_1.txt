Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities or arts rather than in technical fields like computer science.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described characteristics, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is relatively low.
