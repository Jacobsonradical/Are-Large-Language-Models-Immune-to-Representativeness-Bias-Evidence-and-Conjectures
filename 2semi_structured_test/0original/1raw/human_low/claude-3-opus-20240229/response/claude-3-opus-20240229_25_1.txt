To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description.

Key points:
1. Jason is creative, imaginative, and often emotionally driven.
2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
3. He is gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical.

The description suggests that Jason has traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills, while the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical."

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's traits, the probability that he is a computer science professor appears to be low.
