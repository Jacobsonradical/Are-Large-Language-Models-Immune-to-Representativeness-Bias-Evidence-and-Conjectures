To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical.

The description of Jason as "not particularly technical" suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

However, to assign a probability, we must consider the base rates:
- P(Computer Science Professor) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities Professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

Without any other information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 0.25.

Given the description of Jason, which suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be lower than the base rate of 0.25.
