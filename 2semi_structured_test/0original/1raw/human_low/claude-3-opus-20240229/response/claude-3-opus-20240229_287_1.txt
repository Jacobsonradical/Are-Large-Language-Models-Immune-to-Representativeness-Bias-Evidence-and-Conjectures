Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which further suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, it's important not to rely too heavily on stereotypes. There is certainly a possibility that a computer science professor could have the traits described. Without more specific information, it's difficult to assign a precise probability.

That said, given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
