Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that may be more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. The description also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the probability he is a computer science professor.

Given that only 25% of the sample were computer science professors, and Jason's description seems more aligned with a humanities background, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.20.

{"probability": "0.20"}
