Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring, while being not particularly technical, it seems more likely that he is a professor in the humanities rather than computer science.

Without more specific information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This reflects my belief that there is only about a 20% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the limited information provided, which seems to fit more with a humanities background. However, I acknowledge there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor.
