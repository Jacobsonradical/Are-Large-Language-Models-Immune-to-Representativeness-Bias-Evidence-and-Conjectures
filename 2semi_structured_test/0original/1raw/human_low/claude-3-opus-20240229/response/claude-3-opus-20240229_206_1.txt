Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because there is certainly individual variation, and some computer science professors may well have Jason's traits. The description is also quite brief to make a definitive judgment. Nonetheless, if I had to estimate, I'd say there is only about a 15% chance Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the limited information provided.
