Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, emotionally driven, and passionate about non-technical pursuits like traveling, reading and exploring. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical, technical, and detail-oriented.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's personality profile seems more aligned with a humanities background, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be fairly low, around 0.20.
