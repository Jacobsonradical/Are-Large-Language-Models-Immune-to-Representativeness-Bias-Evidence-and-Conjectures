Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which is usually an important trait for a computer science academic. Additionally, his interests and personality traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and exploring) are more commonly associated with humanities fields.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate a low probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
