Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while computer science is a highly technical field. Additionally, traits like being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven are more commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor appears to be low.
