Based on the limited information provided about Jason's personality traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of him being one of the computer science professors in the sample as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. His enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring also aligns more with humanities interests. Furthermore, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is an important skill and interest for computer science professors.

However, it is important to note that individual personality traits and interests can vary widely within both computer science and humanities fields, so this estimate is based on limited information and stereotypical associations.
