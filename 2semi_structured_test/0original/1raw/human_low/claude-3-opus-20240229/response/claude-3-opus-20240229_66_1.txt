Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities fields rather than technical fields like computer science.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
