Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical." 

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering the details in Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.15.
