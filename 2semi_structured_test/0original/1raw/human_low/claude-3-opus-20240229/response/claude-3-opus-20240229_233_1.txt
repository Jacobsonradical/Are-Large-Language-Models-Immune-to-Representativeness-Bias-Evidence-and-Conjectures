Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying reading and exploring, but not being particularly technical, seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technical in their interests and skills.

However, there is still some possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor, as individuals can certainly break the stereotypes of their field. The 0.15 probability estimate reflects that while it seems less likely given his profile, it cannot be ruled out entirely without more information.
