Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. It also specifically notes that he is "not particularly technical". 

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits align more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is relatively low.
