Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about things like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." 

Given the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors (highly analytical, technical, detail-oriented), Jason's profile fits more with the typical image of a humanities professor.

However, these are of course generalizations and there is certainly individual variation. Without more specific information, assigning a precise probability is difficult. As a rough estimate, I would say:

{"probability": "0.2"}

That is, I estimate there is only about a 20% chance that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors, and conversely an 80% chance he is one of the 75 humanities professors. But this is a tentative probability assessment based on limited information and stereotypes that may not always hold true.
