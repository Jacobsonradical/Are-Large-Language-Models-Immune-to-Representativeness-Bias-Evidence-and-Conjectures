Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities or artistic fields.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
