Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as quite low.
