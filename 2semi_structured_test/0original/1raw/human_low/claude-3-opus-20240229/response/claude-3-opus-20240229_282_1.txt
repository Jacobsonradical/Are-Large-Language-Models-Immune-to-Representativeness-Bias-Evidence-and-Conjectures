Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to determine with high certainty whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, based on the description, he seems to have traits more typically associated with the humanities, such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about reading and exploring. The description also explicitly states he is not particularly technical, which is a trait more commonly found in computer science professors.

Since the sample includes 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25%. 

Taking into account both the base rate and the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the base rate.
