Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have personality traits and interests that are more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills and interests that are typically found among computer science professors.

Given this information and the fact that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
