Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, traits that are perhaps more commonly found among professors in the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, it's important to note that these are generalizations and there can certainly be successful computer science professors who break the mold of what's considered typical.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25%. Considering this base rate along with the description that seems more aligned with a humanities professor, I'd estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}
