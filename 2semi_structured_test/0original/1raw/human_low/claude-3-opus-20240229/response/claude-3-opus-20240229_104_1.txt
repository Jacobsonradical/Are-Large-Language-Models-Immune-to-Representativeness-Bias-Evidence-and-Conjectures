Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. A few key points:

1. The description mentions Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science. 

2. It states directly that Jason is "not particularly technical", while technical skills and interests are typical for computer science professors.

3. His interests in traveling, reading, and exploring align more with a humanities background.

4. The description does not mention any computer science related traits, skills or interests for Jason.

Given that only 25% of the sample were computer science professors (25 out of 100), and Jason's profile seems to fit more with a humanities background, I'd estimate the probability he is a computer science professor to be lower than this baseline 25% prior probability.

So in summary:

{"probability": "0.15"}
