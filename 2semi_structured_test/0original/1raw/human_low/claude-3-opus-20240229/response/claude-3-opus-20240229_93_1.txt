Given the description of Jason as a creative, imaginative, emotionally-driven person who enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is noted as being "not particularly technical", the probability that he is a computer science professor seems quite low. Computer science professors tend to be more analytical and technical in their interests and skills.

Based on the limited information provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}
