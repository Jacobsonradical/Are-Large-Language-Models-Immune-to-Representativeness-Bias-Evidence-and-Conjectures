Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his passion for traveling, reading, and exploring. Notably, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, the lack of technical inclination in Jason's description suggests a lower probability of him being a computer science professor.

Additionally, the study included only 25 computer science professors, compared to 75 humanities professors. This means that, even without considering the description, there is only a 25% chance that a randomly selected profile would belong to a computer science professor.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low:

{"probability": "0.1"}
