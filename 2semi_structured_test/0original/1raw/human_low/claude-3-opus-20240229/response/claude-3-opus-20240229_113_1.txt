Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about exploring and reading, while not being particularly technical, seems more closely aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, these are broad generalizations and certainly many computer science professors can have those traits as well. Without more specific information, it's impossible to give a precise probability, but given the description, I believe it is more likely Jason is one of the humanities professors in the sample. My rough estimate is that there is only a 20% chance (probability of 0.2) that Jason is a computer science professor.
