{"probability": "0.2"}

Based on the description, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about pursuits like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may be less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, the description is brief and only captures some aspects of Jason's personality. There is certainly individual variation, and some computer science professors may well have traits like creativity and imagination. So while the humanities seem more probable given the description, I don't think we can rule out computer science entirely.

Weighing these factors, I'd estimate roughly a 20% probability (0.2) that Jason is one of the computer science professors, versus an 80% probability he is one of the humanities professors. But there is considerable uncertainty around this estimate given the limited information provided.
