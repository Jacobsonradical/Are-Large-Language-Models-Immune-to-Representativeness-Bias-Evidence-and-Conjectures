Based on the description provided, Jason's personality traits and interests seem to align more with those commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait often found in successful computer science academics.

Given this information, I would estimate a relatively low probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
