Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. However, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description suggests Jason lacks technical skills or inclinations, the probability of him being one of the computer science professors in the sample appears to be low.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
