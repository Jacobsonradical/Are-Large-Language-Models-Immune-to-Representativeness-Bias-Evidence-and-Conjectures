Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The key pieces of information that suggest this are:

1. Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven". These traits are more stereotypically associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

2. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring - again, activities more commonly associated with humanities fields.

3. Most tellingly, Jason is described as "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical". Being technical is a key requirement for a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and that Jason's description better fits the stereotypical humanities professor, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.10 or 10%.
