Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. 

While there is certainly individual variation, computer science professors as a group are more likely to be analytical, detail-oriented, and technically-inclined.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits seem more aligned with humanities than computer science, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low, around 0.2.
