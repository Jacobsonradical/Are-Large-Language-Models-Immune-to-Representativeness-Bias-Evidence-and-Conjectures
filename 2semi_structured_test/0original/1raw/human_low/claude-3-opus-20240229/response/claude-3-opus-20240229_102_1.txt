Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further suggests that he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's personality description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
