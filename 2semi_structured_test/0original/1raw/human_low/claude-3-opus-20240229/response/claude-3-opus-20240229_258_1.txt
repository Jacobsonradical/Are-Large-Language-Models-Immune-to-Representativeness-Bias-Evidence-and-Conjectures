Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as there is still some possibility that Jason is a computer science professor. Personality traits and interests can vary widely within professions. But given the limited information provided, a computer science professor seems less probable than a humanities professor in this case.
