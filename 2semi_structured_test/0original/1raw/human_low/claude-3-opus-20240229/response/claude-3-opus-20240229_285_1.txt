Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. A few key points:

1. Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" which aligns more with stereotypical traits of humanities professors than computer science professors.

2. He enjoys "traveling, reading, and exploring" which seem to be more common leisure pursuits in the humanities. 

3. Most notably, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which would be quite atypical for a computer science professor.

4. No information is provided about any math, technology or engineering related skills or interests that would point to computer science.

Given that only 25% of the sample were computer science professors, and Jason's profile strongly fits the stereotype of a humanities professor, I would estimate the probability he is a computer science professor to be quite low, around 10%.
