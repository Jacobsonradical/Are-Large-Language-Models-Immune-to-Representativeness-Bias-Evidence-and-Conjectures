Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor. Personality traits have significant individual variation, and there are certainly computer science professors who are creative and passionate about non-technical pursuits. But given the limited information provided, the probability seems rather low that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors out of the total sample of 100 professors.
