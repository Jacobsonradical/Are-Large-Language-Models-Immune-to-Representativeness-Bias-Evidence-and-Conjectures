{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. Some key traits that point to this:

1. He is described as "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven", which are stereotypically more associated with the humanities than technical fields.

2. His interests of traveling, reading, and exploring align more with humanities than computer science. 

3. Most tellingly, the description explicitly states he is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." Technical skills are essential for computer science professors.

Given the small proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample (25 out of 100), and Jason's description strongly suggesting a humanities background, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
