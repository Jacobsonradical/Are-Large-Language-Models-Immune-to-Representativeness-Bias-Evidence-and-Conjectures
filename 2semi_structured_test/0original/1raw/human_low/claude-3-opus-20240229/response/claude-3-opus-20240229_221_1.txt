Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor, as individuals can certainly break stereotypes. The 0.15 probability reflects that while unlikely based on the description, it's not impossible for Jason to be a computer science professor in the sample.
