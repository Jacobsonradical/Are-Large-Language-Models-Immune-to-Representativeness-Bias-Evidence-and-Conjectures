Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits and interests that seem more aligned with humanities than computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait for a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits and interests, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is quite low, around 0.2.
