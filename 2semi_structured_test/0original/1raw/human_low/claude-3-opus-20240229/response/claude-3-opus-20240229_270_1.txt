Based on the description provided, I believe the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is quite low. The key points that lead me to this assessment are:

1. Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven." These traits are more commonly associated with humanities disciplines than with computer science.

2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, which are broad interests not specifically tied to computer science. 

3. Most importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." Technical skills and inclinations are crucial for success in computer science.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits align more closely with stereotypical humanities interests and abilities, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}
