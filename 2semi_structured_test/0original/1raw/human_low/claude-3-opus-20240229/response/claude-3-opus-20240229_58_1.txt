Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical." 

These traits and interests align more closely with stereotypical characteristics of humanities professors than computer science professors. Computer science tends to require strong technical skills and logical, analytical thinking.

However, the description is only a brief sketch and individuals can certainly vary from stereotypes. There's not enough information to conclude with high confidence.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the limited information given, I would say:

{"probability": "0.2"}

That is, my rough estimate is there's a 20% chance Jason is a computer science professor, and an 80% chance he is a humanities professor. But again, this probability estimate is speculative based on very limited data.
