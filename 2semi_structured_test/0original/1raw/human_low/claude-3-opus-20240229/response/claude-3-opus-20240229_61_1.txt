Given the limited information provided, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the description, Jason appears to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors, such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about reading and exploring. The fact that he is described as "not particularly technical" also suggests he may be less likely to be a computer science professor.

Considering there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and Jason's description seems to align more closely with a typical humanities professor, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability could certainly change with more detailed information about Jason's background, research focus, and technical skills. But with the details provided, a 20% chance of him being a computer science professor seems reasonable.
