{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. His traits of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading, and exploring align more with stereotypical traits of humanities professors. 

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor, as technical skills are typically essential in that field.

However, there is still some possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor, as individuals can certainly break stereotypes. The description is also limited and doesn't rule it out definitively. 

Given the 1:3 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, lacking technical traits, and having more humanities-associated traits, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the information provided.
