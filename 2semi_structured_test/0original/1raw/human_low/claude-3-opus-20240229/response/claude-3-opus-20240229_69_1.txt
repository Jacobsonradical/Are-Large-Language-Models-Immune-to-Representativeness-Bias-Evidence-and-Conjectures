Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities fields rather than computer science.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described characteristics, I would estimate a relatively low probability of him being one of the computer science professors.
