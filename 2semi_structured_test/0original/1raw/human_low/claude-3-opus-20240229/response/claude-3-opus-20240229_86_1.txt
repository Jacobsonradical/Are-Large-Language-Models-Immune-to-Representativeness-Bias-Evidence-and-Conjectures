Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative, and passionate about exploring and traveling, rather than being particularly technical.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
