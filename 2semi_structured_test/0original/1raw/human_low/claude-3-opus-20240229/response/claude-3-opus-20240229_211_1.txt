Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
