{"probability": "0.15"}

Given the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are often associated more with humanities than computer science. Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because there is still some chance Jason could be a computer science professor. The description is of just one individual, and there is likely a wide range of personalities even within computer science professors. But based on the limited information provided that seems to fit more with a humanities background, I estimate only about a 15% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
