Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading, and exploring - traits and interests often found in fields like literature, history, or philosophy. Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which is an unusual trait for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and the fact that he is not particularly technical, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
