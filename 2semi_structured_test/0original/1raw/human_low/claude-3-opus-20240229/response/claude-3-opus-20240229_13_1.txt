Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key characteristic for a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
