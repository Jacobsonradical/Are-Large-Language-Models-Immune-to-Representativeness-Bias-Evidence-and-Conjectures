Based on the description provided, here is my assessment:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about reading, traveling and exploring, while not being particularly technical, suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science tends to attract more technical and analytical personality types. However, there is still a possibility he could be a computer science professor, as the field does require creativity too. Since the overall sample included 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors, and Jason's traits seem more humanities-oriented, I estimate around a 15% chance that he is one of the CS professors in the sample.
