To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of each group.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about non-technical pursuits like traveling and reading.

The base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25, as 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science.

However, the description of Jason seems more aligned with stereotypical traits often associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention of being "not particularly technical" especially suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Considering both the base rate and the description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the base rate of 0.25.

{"probability": "0.15"}
