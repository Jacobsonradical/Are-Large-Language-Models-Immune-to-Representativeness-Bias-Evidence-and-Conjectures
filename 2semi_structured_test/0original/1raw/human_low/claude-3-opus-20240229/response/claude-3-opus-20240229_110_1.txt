Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill for a computer science professor.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
