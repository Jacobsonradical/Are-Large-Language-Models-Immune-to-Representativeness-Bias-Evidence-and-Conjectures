Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while computer science is a highly technical field. Additionally, traits like being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven are more commonly associated with the humanities.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described characteristics, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is relatively low.
