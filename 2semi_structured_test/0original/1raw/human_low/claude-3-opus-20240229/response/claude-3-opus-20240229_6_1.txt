Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.15.
