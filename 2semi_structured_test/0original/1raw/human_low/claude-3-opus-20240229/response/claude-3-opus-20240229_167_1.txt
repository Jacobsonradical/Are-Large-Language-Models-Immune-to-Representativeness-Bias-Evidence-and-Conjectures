Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as it is certainly possible for a computer science professor to have the traits described. The description is also quite brief and does not rule out technical aptitude entirely. But given the limited information, the balance of probability seems to tilt significantly towards Jason more likely being one of the humanities professors in the sample.
