Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical". 

These traits seem more stereotypically aligned with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. Computer science professors might be expected to be more technical and analytical in their interests and personality.

However, the description is of just one individual, and there is certainly variance in personality traits within both academic groups. It's quite possible for a computer science professor to have the traits described. So while I believe it's more likely Jason is a humanities professor, I wouldn't rule out the possibility he is in computer science. Hence my estimated probability of 0.15 (or 15%) that Jason is a computer science professor based on the limited information provided.
