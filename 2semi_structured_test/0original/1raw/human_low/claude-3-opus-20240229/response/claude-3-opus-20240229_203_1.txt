Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, based on the description, he seems to fit the stereotypical traits of a humanities professor more closely than those of a computer science professor.

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities. The description also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which makes it less likely for him to be a computer science professor.

That said, individual traits can vary widely, and without more specific information it's impossible to give a definitive answer. Since the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25%.

Weighing the base rate along with the limited evidence pointing weakly towards humanities, I'd estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
