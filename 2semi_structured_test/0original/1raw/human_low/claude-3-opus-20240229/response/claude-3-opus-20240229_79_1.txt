Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative" and "not particularly technical", which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields than computer science.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
