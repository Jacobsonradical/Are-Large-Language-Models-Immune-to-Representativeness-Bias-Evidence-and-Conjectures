{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoys activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical".

Given that the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits align more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample is relatively low, around 0.15 (or 15%).
