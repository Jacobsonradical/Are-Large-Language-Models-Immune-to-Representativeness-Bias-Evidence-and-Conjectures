Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors than computer science professors. Being described as "not particularly technical" also suggests Jason is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, these are generalizations and there is certainly individual variation. Some computer science professors may fit this profile while some humanities professors may not. Without more specific information, I'd estimate about a 20% chance Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors in the sample, and an 80% chance he is one of the 75 humanities professors. But this is a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotyping, which has significant limitations.
