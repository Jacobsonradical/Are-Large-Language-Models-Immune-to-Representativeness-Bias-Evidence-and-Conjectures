Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his passion for activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also notes that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, requiring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, the description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be one of the humanities professors.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is quite low:

{"probability": "0.2"}
