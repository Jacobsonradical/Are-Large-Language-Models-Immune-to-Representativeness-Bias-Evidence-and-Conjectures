Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. He enjoys activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits and interests are more commonly associated with humanities disciplines rather than technical fields like computer science.

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, there is still a non-zero probability that Jason could be a computer science professor, as the field can attract people with diverse personalities and skill sets. The provided probability of 0.2 reflects this possibility while still favoring the likelihood that Jason is one of the humanities professors, given the limited information available.
