Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, these are generalizations and there is certainly individual variation. 

Given the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor is 25%. The details in Jason's description lower that probability somewhat in my estimation, but do not rule it out entirely. Therefore, I place the probability at 0.2 or 20%.
