Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which further suggests that he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
