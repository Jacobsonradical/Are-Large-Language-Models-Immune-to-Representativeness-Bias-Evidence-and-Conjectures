Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and professors in this area are typically expected to have strong technical skills, the lack of technical inclination in Jason's description suggests a lower probability of him being a computer science professor.

Additionally, the sample includes 75 professors from the humanities and only 25 from computer science. This means that, even without considering the description, there is a higher prior probability (75%) that a randomly selected professor from this study would be from the humanities.

Therefore, considering both the description and the prior probabilities, I estimate a relatively low probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
