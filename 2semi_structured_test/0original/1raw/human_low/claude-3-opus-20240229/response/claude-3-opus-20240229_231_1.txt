Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that are more typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading, and exploration. Notably, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is an important trait for success in computer science.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described characteristics, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
