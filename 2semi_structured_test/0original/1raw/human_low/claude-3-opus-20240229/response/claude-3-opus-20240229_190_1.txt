Based on the description provided, Jason does not exhibit the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are characteristics more commonly linked to individuals in the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical," further suggesting he is unlikely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low.
