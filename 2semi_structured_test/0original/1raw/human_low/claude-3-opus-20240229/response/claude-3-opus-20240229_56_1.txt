Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. While there can certainly be individual differences, computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technically inclined.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
