Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about pursuits like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical". These traits and interests align more closely with stereotypical attributes of humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

Given that there are also 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the sample, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% probability of Jason being a humanities professor.

Considering both the base rate and the description that seems more characteristic of a humanities professor, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be fairly low, around 0.2.
