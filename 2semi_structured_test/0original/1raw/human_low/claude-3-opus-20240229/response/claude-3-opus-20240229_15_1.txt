Based on the brief description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creatively and emotionally oriented rather than technically inclined.

Given that the sample consisted of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and lacking any other information to suggest Jason is a computer science professor, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

This reflects the baseline proportion of computer science professors in the sample, absent other distinguishing information.
