From the description, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring rather than being particularly technical.

Given that there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, and Jason's description aligns more with a humanities background, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be fairly low, around 0.20.
