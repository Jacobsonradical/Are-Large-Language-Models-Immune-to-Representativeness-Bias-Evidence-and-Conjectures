Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as it's certainly possible for a computer science professor to have diverse interests and personality traits not fitting the stereotype. The study included 25 computer science professors, so even if Jason does not fit the typical mold, there is still some chance he could be one of them.
