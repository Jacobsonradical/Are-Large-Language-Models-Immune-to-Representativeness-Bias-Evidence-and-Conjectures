Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities.

Given that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
