{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The base rates inform us that 25% of the professors in the study are from computer science. Despite personality traits that might seem more typical of someone in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), the initial probabilities based on the sample size suggest a 25% chance for any randomly chosen description. Without further evidence strongly favoring the humanities over computer science, it is statistically sensible to maintain the original base rate.
