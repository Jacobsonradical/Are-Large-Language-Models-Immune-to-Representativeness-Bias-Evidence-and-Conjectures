{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the ratio 25:75 or 1:3. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{1}{4} \) or 0.25.

While Jason's personality traits may not fit the stereotypical image of a computer science professor as well as they do a humanities professor, the correct approach here is to use the base rates provided in the sample, as we cannot further leverage the description to adjust the probability without introducing bias.
