{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given that there are 25 professors in computer science and 75 professors in the humanities, the base rate probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25. Even though Jason's description might suggest traits that are stereotypically more common in humanities, we need to consider the base rate information when determining the probability.
