Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the base probability that any professor chosen at random is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) or 25%.

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which might be more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Taking this into account, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor could be further reduced.

However, a specific numerical adjustment requires Bayesian reasoning, which factors in both the base rate (prior probability) and the likelihood of the description given the two categories.

Without more specific information on how likely such a description is in either group, we can qualitatively infer that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability that he is a computer science professor would be lower than the base rate.

A conservative estimate might drop the initial probability by half or more, given the description is less likely for a computer science professor.

To reflect this subjective assessment, a reasonable probability might be:

{"probability": "0.10"}
