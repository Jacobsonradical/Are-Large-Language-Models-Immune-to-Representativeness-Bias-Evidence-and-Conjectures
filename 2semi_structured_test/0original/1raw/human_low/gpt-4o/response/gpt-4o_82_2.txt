{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that Jason's description highlights traits that are often more associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical), and knowing that only 25% of the sampled professors are from computer science (25 out of 100), it is more likely that Jason is a professor in the humanities than in computer science. Therefore, the probability that he is one of the computer science professors is relatively low. 

Applying Bayes' Theorem, given the base rate of 25% (0.25) for computer science professors and the nature of the description aligning more closely with humanities traits, the probability of him being a computer science professor remains 0.25 or 25%.
