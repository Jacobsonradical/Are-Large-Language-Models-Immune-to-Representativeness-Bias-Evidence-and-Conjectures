Based on the given description, it seems that Jason's characteristics match more closely with those traditionally associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven traits, combined with his lack of technical inclination, tend to align more with the humanities.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability for a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25, and from humanities is 75/100 = 0.75.

Given Jason's description aligns more with the traits associated with humanities professors, the probability of him being a computer science professor is likely lower than the base rate of 0.25.

Therefore, incorporating the characteristic matching, I will adjust the probability downward.

{"probability": "0.1"}
