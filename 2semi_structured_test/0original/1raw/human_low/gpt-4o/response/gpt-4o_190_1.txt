{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description provided, Jason's traits such as being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical match more closely with the typical profiles associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate proportion for a computer science professor out of the total (100 professors) is 0.25. Given the description, it's reasonable to rely on these base rates in the absence of more specific information indicating "computer science" tendencies.
