Given that the study involves 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the initial probabilities of randomly selecting a description for either group are as follows:

- Probability of selecting a computer science professor's description: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor's description: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Jason's description suggests that he is creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more closely with those typically associated with humanities professors.

Using Bayes' theorem for a more refined probability calculation, where:
1. \( P(H_c) \) is the initial probability Jason is a computer science professor: 0.25.
2. \( P(H_h) \) is the initial probability Jason is a humanities professor: 0.75.
3. \( P(D|H_c) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H_h) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Assuming Jason's description appears more likely for humanities professors, let's estimate:
- \( P(D|H_c) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H_h) \approx 0.7 \)

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_c|
