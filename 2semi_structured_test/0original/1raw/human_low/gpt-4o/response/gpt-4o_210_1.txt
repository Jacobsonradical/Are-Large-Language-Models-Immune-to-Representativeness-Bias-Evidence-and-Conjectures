{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimate is derived by considering the base rates of the two groups of professors: 25 out of 100 are computer science professors, so the base rate probability is 0.25. The description of Jason does not provide strong evidence to sway significantly from this prior probability as it matches more closely with traits that may be found in humanities professors. However, since it does not entirely exclude the possibility of being a computer science professor, the prior probability is a reasonable estimate.
