{"probability": "0.25"}

Here's the reasoning for how this probability is calculated: 

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The probability that Jason is a computer science professor without considering his description is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

Jason's description seems to suggest traits more commonly associated with the humanities (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical). However, the base rate (the initial probabilities based solely on the number of professors in each category) should still be taken into account unless additional statistical analysis is applied to update these probabilities with Bayesian inference.

Given the information and without complex statistical adjustments, the base rate provides the most straightforward probability estimate.
