Based on the description provided, Jason appears to exhibit traits that are often more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, especially given the non-technical emphasis. Additionally, the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, meaning the prior probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor is higher.

To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we perform a Bayesian update. The Bayesian inference will take into account both the prior probabilities and the likelihood based on the given description.

1. Prior probability of a computer science professor (P(CS)):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Prior probability of a humanities professor (P(H)):
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given Jason's description, the likelihood of him matching the typical traits of a humanities professor seems higher than that of a computer science professor. For argumentâ€™s sake, let's assign the following estimated likelihood values based on the description:

3. Likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's description (P(Description | CS)):
Given the description appears less typical for a computer science professor, let's assume:
\[ P(Description | CS) = 0.1 \]
