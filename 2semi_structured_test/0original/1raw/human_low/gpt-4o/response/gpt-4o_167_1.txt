{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The base rate of computer science professors among the total professors interviewed is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. Although the description of Jason may contain attributes that seem more in line with humanities professors, the base rate is a significant factor in assessing the probability. Without any additional specific evidence indicating Jason's precise academic field beyond his personality traits, it is reasonable to go with the base rate probability.
