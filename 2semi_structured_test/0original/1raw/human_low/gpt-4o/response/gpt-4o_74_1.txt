{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the description of Jason, his personality traits are more closely aligned with those commonly found in the humanities rather than in technical fields like computer science. Moreover, the initial sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means the base rate probability of randomly choosing a humanities professor is significantly higher than that of choosing a computer science professor.

However, it's important to also consider that some creative and emotionally driven, gifted individuals might still be in the field of computer science. Hence, combining both the base rate and the description, I'd estimate a lower but non-zero probability.
