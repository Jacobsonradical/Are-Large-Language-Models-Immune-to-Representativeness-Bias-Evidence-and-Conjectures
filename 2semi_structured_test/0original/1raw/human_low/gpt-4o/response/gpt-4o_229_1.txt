Given the description provided and assuming no other biases or prior knowledge, we can use a statistical approach called Bayesian inference to estimate the probability.

1. **Base Rate (Prior Probability):**
   - Percentage of computer science professors in the sample: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Percentage of humanities professors in the sample: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood Based on Description:**
   - The description does not explicitly favor computer science over humanities. In fact, the description of being "creative," "imaginative," and "exploring" might even lean more towards humanities based on common stereotypes, though this is not strictly a scientific measure. However, let's remain neutral and assume the likelihood does not heavily sway the probability.

Given the base rate is significantly in favor of humanities professors (0.75 vs. 0.25), and with no strong reason from the description to assume otherwise, the probability is primarily influenced by the base rate.

Therefore, the estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided and the base rates is:
