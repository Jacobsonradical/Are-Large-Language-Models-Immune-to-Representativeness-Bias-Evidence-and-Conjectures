{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Since we know there are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 in the humanities, the base rate (prior probability) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science is 0.25 (25 out of 100). Given the description, Jason does not seem to exhibit traits that are particularly aligned with a typical computer science professor. His interests and traits appear more aligned with those often found in the humanities. Therefore, the base rate of 0.25 is used as the final probability without additional evidence to strongly suggest otherwise.
