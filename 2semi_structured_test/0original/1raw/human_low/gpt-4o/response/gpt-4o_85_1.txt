Given the information in the description, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's use Bayes' Theorem, which requires the following components:

1. **P(CS)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. **P(HUM)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
3. **P(Description | CS)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. **P(Description | HUM)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

First, calculate the prior probabilities based on the provided data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So,
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood ratios. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which might be more common traits among humanities professors than computer science professors. Without specific values, we will assume a higher likelihood of these traits appearing among humanities professors.

Assuming:
\[ P(Description | CS) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(Description | HUM) = 0.9 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS |
