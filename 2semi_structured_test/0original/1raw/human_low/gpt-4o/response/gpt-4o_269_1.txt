Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. However, without detailed prior probabilities and conditional probabilities of each described trait given the profession, we have to rely on basic assumptions.

From the sample, we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means the prior probability P(CS) of being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25, and the prior probability P(H) of being a humanities professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Given the description, Jason does not seem particularly technical, which might be considered less likely for a computer science professor and more likely for a humanities professor. However, this is a qualitative assessment.

Without exact numerical likelihoods, we can intuitively adjust our prior probabilities based on the description leaning more towards humanities. For the sake of this estimation, let's assign a smaller likelihood to Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor based on his described traits.

A reasonable adjustment might be assuming the likelihood ratio to be around 1:3, indicating humanities professors are three times more likely to fit this description than computer science professors.

Thus, our adjusted probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since P(Description) is complex to estimate without exact numbers, we simplify using our adjusted ratio conceptually:
