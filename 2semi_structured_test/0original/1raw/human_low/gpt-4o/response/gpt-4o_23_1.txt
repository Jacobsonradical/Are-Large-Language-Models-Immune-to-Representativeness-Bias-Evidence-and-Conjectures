{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability reflects the base rates of the two groups in the study: 25% (25 out of 100) are computer science professors, and 75% (75 out of 100) are humanities professors. Given the description provided and considering it doesn't include particularly strong indicators specific to either field, it is reasonable to base the probability primarily on the initial distribution.
