{"probability": "0.25"}

The probability is calculated based on the base rates of the two groups. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without additional information differentiating Jason's traits as specific to either group, the base rates dominate the likelihood.

Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) for computer science professors is \( \frac{1}{4} \) or 0.25, and the prior probability \( P(Hum) \) for humanities professors is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75.

Given Jason's description lacks strong distinguishing factors away from average humanities professor traits, the base rates remain a strong indicator of the probability. Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).
