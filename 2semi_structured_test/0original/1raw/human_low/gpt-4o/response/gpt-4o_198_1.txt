Given the description, we should consider the relative sizes of the two groups and how well Jason's characteristics match the typical profiles of people in those fields. 

Firstly, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so even before we consider Jason's individual characteristics, Jason is more likely to be from the humanities group simply due to the larger number in that group.

Secondly, HumaÂ­nities fields often emphasize creativity, imagination, and emotional expression, while computer science is generally more technical and analytical.

Jason's description fits more with common perceptions of someone in the humanities:

1. **Creative and imaginative**: These traits are often associated more with the humanities.
2. **Emotionally driven**: Humanities scholars may often focus more on emotional and human experiences compared to technical fields.
3. **Not particularly technical**: This specifically aligns less with a computer science professor.

Considering these points, the probability is skewed significantly towards Jason being a professor in the humanities rather than in computer science.

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.1"}
