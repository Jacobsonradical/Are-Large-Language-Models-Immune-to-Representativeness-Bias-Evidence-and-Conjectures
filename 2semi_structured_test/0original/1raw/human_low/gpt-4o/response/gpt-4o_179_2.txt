{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer is based on the fact that the original sample size contains 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, which provides an initial base rate probability of 0.25 (or 25%). The description given for Jason does not strongly imply traits that are more prevalent in computer science professors as opposed to humanities professors, suggesting there's no reason to heavily adjust the base rate probability. Thus, the probability remains 0.25.
