{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimate is based on the representativeness heuristic, which considers Jason's description more indicative of traits commonly associated with humanities professors. Given that 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, the base probability is 0.25. However, the description does not align strongly with technical fields like computer science, making it less likely for Jason to belong to that group. Thus, the estimated probability is closer to the base rate.
