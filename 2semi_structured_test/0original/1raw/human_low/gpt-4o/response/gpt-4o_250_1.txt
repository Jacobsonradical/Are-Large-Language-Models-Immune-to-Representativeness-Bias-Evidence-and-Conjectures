{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimate is based on the base rate of computer science professors in the sample (25 out of 100), which provides an initial probability of 0.25 without additional specific information that could significantly alter the base rate. The description provided seems more aligned with typical traits found in humanities professors, but without being explicitly outside the realm of possibility for a computer science professor, the base rate remains a strong factor in this estimate.
