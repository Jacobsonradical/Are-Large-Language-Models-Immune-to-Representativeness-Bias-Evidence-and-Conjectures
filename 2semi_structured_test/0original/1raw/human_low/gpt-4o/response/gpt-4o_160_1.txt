{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: 
Given the description, Jason seems to possess traits that could be more common among humanities professors due to his creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven nature. Additionally, the mention that he is "not particularly technical" suggests he may not fit the typical profile of a computer science professor, who generally needs a more technical and logical skill set. 

When choosing a random description from the sample of 100 professors, where only 25 are computer science professors, the base rate probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25. Adjusting for the described traits that lean more towards the humanities, there is no compelling evidence to strongly adjust up or down, so the rounded base rate probability remains at 0.25.
