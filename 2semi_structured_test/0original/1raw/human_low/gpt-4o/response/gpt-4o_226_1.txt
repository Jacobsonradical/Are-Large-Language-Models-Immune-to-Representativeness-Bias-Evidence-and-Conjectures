{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The description of Jason suggests he has traits that are more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science (e.g., being emotionally driven, creative, and not particularly technical). Given that there are 75 professors from the humanities and 25 from computer science, the base rate probability that a random professor from the sample is from computer science is 0.25 (25 out of 100). Considering his described traits, this base rate seems appropriate.
