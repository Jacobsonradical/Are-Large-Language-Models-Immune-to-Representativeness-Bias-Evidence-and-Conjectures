{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimation is based on the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the base probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors 25 out of 100, or 0.25. The description provided does not strongly suggest attributes that would significantly alter this base rate, so the prior probability is a reasonable estimate.
