{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer is based on the base rate of the two groups in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Without more specific information, the ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample is 1:3. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 25/(25+75) = 0.25.
