{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the Bayesian inference considering the base rate fallacy. The initial base rates (proportion of professors from each category) provide useful information:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

This means, before considering the description, there is a 1 in 4 chance (0.25) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science and a 3 in 4 chance (0.75) that they are from the humanities.

Since the description does not include specific information heavily suggesting a highly technical or computer science-oriented background and more closely aligns with a profile typical of the humanities (creativity, imagination, emotional drive, reading, and exploring), it does little to significantly alter these base rates.

Thus, the initial probabilities remain heavily influential:
- Probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors: 0.25
