Given the description of Jason, let's consider the base rates of the two groups. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the overall probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science:

P(CS) = 25 / (25 + 75) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Conversely, the probability of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities is:

P(Hum) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason suggests traits that are more often associated with humanities than with computer science, based on common stereotypes and the given details. Traits such as being "creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical" align more closely with the stereotypical understanding of humanities professors.

Despite the specific details, I need to account for the base rates provided:

- There are 3 times more humanities professors than computer science professors.
 
Given this information, I will adjust the probability estimate considering both the personality description and base rates.

Thus, I conclude:

{"probability": "0.10"}
