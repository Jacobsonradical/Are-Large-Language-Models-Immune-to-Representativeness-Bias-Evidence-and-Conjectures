{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation:
Given the description, Jason shows traits that seem more aligned with the humanities than with computer science. Additionally, the base rate of the sample needs to be considered â€” 25 professors are from computer science and 75 from the humanities. Therefore, based purely on the initial distribution, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors without considering personality traits is 0.25 (25 out of 100). Factoring in that Jason's description aligns more with typical humanities traits reinforces this estimate.
