{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is 0.25. Based on the description provided, Jason's characteristics align more closely with the stereotypical traits often associated with humanities professors than those typically found in the field of computer science. However, without more specific information linking these traits to one group more definitively than the other, the base rate (or prior probability) is used to make an informed estimate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains at 0.25.
