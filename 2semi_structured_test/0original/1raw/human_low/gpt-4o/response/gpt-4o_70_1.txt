{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer takes into consideration the given description of Jason and the base rates of the two groups in the study. The description suggests qualities that might be more common in the humanities, but since the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25 out of 100, the probability should reflect those base rates as well. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
