To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be simplified by focusing on the base rates given the information provided:

1. Total sample size = 25 (computer science professors) + 75 (humanities professors) = 100 professors.
2. The base rate (prior probability) for Jason being a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors to the total sample size.

Prior probability (computer science) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
                                   = 25 / 100
                                   = 0.25

Even though we could consider the personality description provided, since it does not specifically mention any trait that is exclusive or predominantly found in one discipline versus the other, it is prudent to stick to the base rates given the lack of strong discriminatory information.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the information provided, is 0.25.
