{"probability": "0.25"}

This is based on the fact that, from a purely statistical perspective, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, giving us an a priori probability of 25/100 (or 0.25) that any randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor. Additionally, Jason's profile aligns more with traits typically associated with the humanities, such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might suggest a lower likelihood than the base rate. However, without explicit differentiation criteria, sticking with the base rate is the most objective approach.
