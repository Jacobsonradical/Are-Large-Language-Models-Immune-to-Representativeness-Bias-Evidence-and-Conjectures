{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimation is based on the sample distribution: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the base rate for a randomly chosen professor being from computer science 0.25. The description given seems to align more with humanities-based interests and characteristics, but without further specific information geared towards discerning between the two fields, the base rate provides the most rational estimate.
