{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Since the study interviewed 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of any given description belonging to a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\). The description of Jason, which highlights creativity, imagination, and a lack of technical focus, aligns more closely with the traits often associated with humanities professors. While the description does not allow for precise discrimination, we stick with the base rate without additional strong evidence tilting towards either group.
