Based on the given description, Jason appears to have traits that are often associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Considering that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, a random professor being a computer science professor would naturally be 25/100 or 0.25. However, given Jason's specific traits, it seems more likely that he is a humanities professor.

Given this, the probability is adjusted slightly lower than the base rate of 0.25:

{"probability": "0.15"}
