{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Since we are given no specific information that distinguishes Jason as being more likely to be in either group, a logical approach is to rely on the base rate probabilities. 

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
