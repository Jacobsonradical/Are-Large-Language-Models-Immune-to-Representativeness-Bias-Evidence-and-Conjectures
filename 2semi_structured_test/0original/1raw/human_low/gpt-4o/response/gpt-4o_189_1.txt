{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate of Jason being from the computer science group is 25 out of 100, or 0.25. While the description of Jason might seem more aligned with typical traits of a humanities professor, this base rate probability provides a straightforward answer without making assumptions based on stereotypes.
