Sure, I will calculate the probability taking into account the base rates and description provided.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the base rate probability that Jason could be a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

However, to better estimate the probability, we can consider the description of Jason. His traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying reading and exploring, and being passionate but not technical, seem to align more closely with typical stereotypes of someone in the humanities rather than computer science.

Hence, without additional detailed analysis, but accounting for the given description and base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors seems lower than the base rate of 0.25.

Assuming the description heavily biases towards humanities professors, let's adjust to a rough estimate.

{"probability": "0.1"}
