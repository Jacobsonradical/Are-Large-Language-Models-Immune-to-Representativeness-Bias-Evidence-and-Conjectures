{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the sample sizes provided: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors (total 100 professors). Given no other information about the specific personality traits distribution among these groups, one might assume a higher likelihood of Jason fitting into the larger group. Therefore, the probability would be proportional to the group sizes: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
