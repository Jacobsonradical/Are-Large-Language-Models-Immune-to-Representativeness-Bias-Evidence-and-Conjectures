Here’s a way to approach this problem using Bayes' theorem for calculating conditional probability. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason is described by the given profile.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) = Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To find \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \):
- Let’s assume \( P(B|A) = x \) (the likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description) and \( P(B|\neg A) = y \) (the likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description) since we have limited details on actual probabilities in these conditions.
