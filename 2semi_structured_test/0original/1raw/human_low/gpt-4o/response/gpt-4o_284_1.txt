{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer is based on the principle of base rates from probability theory. Initially, the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, indicating that there is a higher base rate for humanities professors. Given that no specific evidence strongly points towards Jason being a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor, the base rate suggests that the probability should reflect the original proportions of the groups. Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 25%, or 0.25.
