{"probability": "0.25"}

The rationale behind this estimate is that although Jason's description indicates traits more commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we must also take into account the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample. In this study, 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science, so the base rate of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 0.25. Given the description, it seems more likely Jason is from the humanities, but to account for the base rate, the probability that he is a computer science professor remains at 0.25.
