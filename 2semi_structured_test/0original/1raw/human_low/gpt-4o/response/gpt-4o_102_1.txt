{"probability": "0.25"}

To arrive at this probability, consider that out of the 100 professors, 25 are from computer science, and 75 are from the humanities. This implies that there is a 1 in 4 chance (0.25 probability) that any given professor is a computer science professor, without additional information.

The description of Jason includes traits that may not be as strongly associated with the field of computer science (such as being emotionally driven and not particularly technical) and seem to align more with the humanities. Although this could influence one's intuition to lean toward a lower probability, it is crucial to stick with the base rate to avoid the representativeness heuristic. Therefore, the base rate probability is a more reliable estimate in this context.
