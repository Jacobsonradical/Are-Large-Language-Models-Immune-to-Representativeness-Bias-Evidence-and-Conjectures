{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that we have a description of someone who is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, and considering that these traits are often more associated with humanities rather than computer science, there is a higher likelihood that Jason is one of the humanities professors.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Base Rates**: Among the 100 professors, 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities. So, even before considering the description, the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25 and from humanities is 75/100 = 0.75.

2. **Description Fit**: The description fits more closely with common perceptions of personality traits often found in humanities professors. This fits better with the humanities group.

Given the predominance of humanities professors in the study (75%) and the matching description traits, it is therefore more probable that Jason is from the humanities.

However, since we have not ruled out the possibility entirely that Jason could be a computer science professor, especially if computer science professors can also be creative but rare, the probability for Jason being a computer science professor is:
0.25.
