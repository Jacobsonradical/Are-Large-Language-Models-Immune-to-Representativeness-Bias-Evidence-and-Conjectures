{"probability": "0.25"}

In this study, 25% of the professors interviewed are from computer science and 75% are from the humanities. The description of Jason aligns more closely with attributes commonly associated with humanities professors. Thus, while not impossible, the likelihood, given the relative proportions, is lower for Jason to be from computer science.
