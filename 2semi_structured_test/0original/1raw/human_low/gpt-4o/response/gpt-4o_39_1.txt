{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, without additional information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 0.25 (25 out of 100). Jason's described traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) align more closely with those typically associated with humanities, rather than the more technical traits generally associated with computer science. Hence, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor. The base rate probability, which is the initial probability without further evidence, is 0.25.
