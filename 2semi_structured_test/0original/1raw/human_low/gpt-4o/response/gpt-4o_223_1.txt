{"probability": "0.25"}

This answer is based on the number of computer science professors versus the number of humanities professors in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Therefore, there is a 25% chance (or a probability of 0.25) that Jason, chosen at random from this group, is one of the computer science professors.
