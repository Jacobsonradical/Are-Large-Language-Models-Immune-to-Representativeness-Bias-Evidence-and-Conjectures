{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the fact that out of the 100 professors interviewed, 25 were from computer science and 75 were from the humanities. While Jason's description does not strongly indicate a technical inclination, which aligns more with humanities, the base rate of the sample gives a rough estimate.
