{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the description, Jason's traits align more closely with those typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are all important qualities in the humanities. Additionally, he is described as "not particularly technical," which somewhat discounts the likelihood of him being a computer science professor. 

Considering the sample sizes (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors), the pre-existing likelihood of randomly picking a humanities professor is 0.75, while the likelihood of picking a computer science professor is 0.25. Given the description, it reinforces the higher likelihood that Jason is from the humanities. Thus, the adjusted probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains close to the prior probability of 0.25.
