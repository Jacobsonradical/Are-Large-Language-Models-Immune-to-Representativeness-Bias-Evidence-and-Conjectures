{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given the sample has 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, the baseline probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25%. The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying travel, reading, exploring, and being passionate but not particularly technical does not strongly align with typical stereotypical traits associated with computer science professionals but fits common traits among humanities professors more closely. Therefore, the probability remains at the baseline value of 0.25 (25%).
