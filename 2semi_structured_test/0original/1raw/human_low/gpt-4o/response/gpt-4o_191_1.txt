{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Since the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25 out of 100 (or 25%), and the description does not provide strong evidence distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors, the initial base rate can be used as the probability. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
