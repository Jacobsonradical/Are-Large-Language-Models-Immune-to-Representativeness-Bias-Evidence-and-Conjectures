{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and based solely on the prior probability, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\). The description provided does not strongly align with traits uniquely attributable to either group enough to disproportionately alter this base rate. Therefore, the probability remains at 0.25.
