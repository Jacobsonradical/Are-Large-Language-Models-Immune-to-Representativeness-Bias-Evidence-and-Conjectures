{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimate is based on the base rate of computer science professors among the total sample. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25 (or 25%). While the description of Jason might fit certain stereotypes or heuristics, it is important to rely on base rates when no additional distinguishing information strongly suggests otherwise.
