{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the description of Jason, it suggests traits more commonly associated with humanities professors. With a sample of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability for any randomly selected professor to be from computer science is 0.25 and from the humanities is 0.75.

Since Jason's traits align more closely with the creative and emotionally driven characteristics often found in humanities, we can be less inclined to believe he is a computer science professor despite the base rates. However, to remain objective and account for the base rate information, we still recognize there's a 0.25 chance.
