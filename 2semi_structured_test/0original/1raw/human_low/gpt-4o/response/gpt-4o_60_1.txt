{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25%, as 25 out of the 100 professors are from computer science. The description of Jason aligns more with typical traits associated with the humanities (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate) rather than traits typically associated with computer science (e.g., technical skills). Therefore, we should lean on the base rate, adjusted slightly by the descriptive evidence.
