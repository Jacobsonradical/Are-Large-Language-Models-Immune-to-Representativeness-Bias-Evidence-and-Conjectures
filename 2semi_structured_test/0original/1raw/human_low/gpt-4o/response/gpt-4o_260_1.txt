{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the description, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Since we have a sample of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate or prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25. Without additional information that specifically indicates Jason's field, it's reasonable to maintain the base rate.
