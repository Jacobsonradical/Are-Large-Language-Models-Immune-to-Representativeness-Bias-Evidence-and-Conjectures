{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: The sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Since no additional information strongly suggests Jason belongs to one group over the other based solely on the provided description, it is reasonable to rely on the base rates. Thus, there is a 1 in 4 chance (0.25) that random individual Jason is one of the computer science professors.
