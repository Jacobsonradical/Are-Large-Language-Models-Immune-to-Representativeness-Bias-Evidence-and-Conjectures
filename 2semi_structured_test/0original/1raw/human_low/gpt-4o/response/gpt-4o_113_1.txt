{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in the humanities. Assuming that Jason's description does not favor one group more than the other and there's no prior evidence suggesting he fits more into one category, the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, which is 0.25.
