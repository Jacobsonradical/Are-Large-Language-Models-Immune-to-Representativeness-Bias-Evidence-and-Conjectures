{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is derived from initially observing that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study. Given Jason's described traits, which align more closely with typical attributes associated with humanities rather than technical fields, it seems reasonable to apply initial base rates (one-fourth being computer science professors) and modestly adjust for trait alignment.
