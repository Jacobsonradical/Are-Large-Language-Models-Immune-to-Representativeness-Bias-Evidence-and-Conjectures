Given the description and the overall makeup of the sample (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors), we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Let:
- \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) be the description of Jason. 

We need to find \(P(C|D)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that a professor is in computer science, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description, which can be expanded using the law of total probability as follows:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Now, we need to understand the likelihoods \(P
