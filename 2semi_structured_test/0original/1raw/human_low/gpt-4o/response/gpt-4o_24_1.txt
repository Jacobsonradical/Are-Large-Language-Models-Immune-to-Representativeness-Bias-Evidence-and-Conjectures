Based on the description provided, Jason seems to align more closely with traits that are often associated with the humanities rather than computer science. Humanities professors are often more emotionally driven, creative, and imaginative compared to their technical counterparts in computer science.

Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability (without additional information) that any given professor is from computer science is 0.25.

However, factoring in the description, which leans more towards a humanities profile, the probability of Jason being from computer science becomes even lower.

Taking into account these considerations, I'd estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.15"}
