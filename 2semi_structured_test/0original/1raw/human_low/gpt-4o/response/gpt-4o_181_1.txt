Certainly! To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, one must also consider the base rates provided in the study. Specifically, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Given the description, Jason's traits do not strongly suggest a technical background and align more with the humanities.

However, one can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the base rate probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

While \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \) aren't directly given, we can reason based on the provided information:

- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (base rate for computer science professors)
- \( P(\neg A) = P(\text{Humanities}) = 0.75 \)

Assuming the description fits humanities professors much better, let's assume: 
- \( P(B|\text{
