{"probability": "0.25"}

This is because Jason's traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical align more closely with characteristics often associated with the humanities than with computer science. Given the ratio of 25 computer science professors to 75 humanities professors (1:3), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25. The description does not provide strong evidence to shift this probability significantly.
