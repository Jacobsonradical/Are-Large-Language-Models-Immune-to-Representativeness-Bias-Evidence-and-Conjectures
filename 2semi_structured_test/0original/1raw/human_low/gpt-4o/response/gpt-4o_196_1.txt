Based on the description of Jason, it seems that his characteristics align more with what one might typically associate with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, and considering the less technical and more creative and emotionally driven nature of the description, it seems more likely that Jason is from the humanities group.

However, to determine the probability, let's apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) as the posterior probability of being a computer science professor given the description (what we need to find).

Given the numbers,
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now without specific values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), but based on typical assumptions, let's assume the probability of Jason's description appearing is low in the computer science group (say 0.1) and
