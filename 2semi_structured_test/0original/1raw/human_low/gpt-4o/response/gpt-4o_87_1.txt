Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical, and enjoys activities such as traveling, reading, and exploring, these characteristics seem more aligned with the typical personality traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor 25%. However, given the described personality traits, this likelihood decreases significantly.

Based on this analysis, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is quite low. I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.1"}
