{"probability": "0.25"}

This estimate is based on the known proportions of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25. The description provided does not strongly suggest that Jason is a computer science professor over a humanities professor, thus the prior probability remains unchanged.
