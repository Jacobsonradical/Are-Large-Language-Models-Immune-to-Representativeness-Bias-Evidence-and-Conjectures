{"probability": "0.25"}

My reasoning is based on the sizes of the two groups in the study. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This gives the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor as 25/100 and a humanities professor as 75/100.

Though the description of Jason fits stereotypes that might be associated more closely with those in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), without any concrete evidence or more specific data linking personality traits directly to the probability of being in either group, it is more statistically sound to base the probability on the initial proportions.

Therefore, given that 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, the initial unbiased probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.
