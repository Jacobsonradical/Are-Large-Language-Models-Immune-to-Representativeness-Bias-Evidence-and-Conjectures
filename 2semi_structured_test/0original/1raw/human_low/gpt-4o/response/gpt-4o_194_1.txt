{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: This probability is derived from the base rates given in the study. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors out of the 100 total professors, the base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25%. Jason's description aligns more with traits that might be more common among humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). However, given only the base rates and the description matching more closely with humanities traits, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the base rate, which is 0.25 or 25%.
