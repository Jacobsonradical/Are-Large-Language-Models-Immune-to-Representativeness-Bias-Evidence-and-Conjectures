{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is calculated by considering the base rates given in the study and the description provided. The description does not strongly favor computer science or the humanities, but given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability before considering the description is 25/100 = 0.25 for a computer science professor and 75/100 = 0.75 for a humanities professor. Without strong evidence from the description to shift these probabilities, we should rely on these base rates.
