{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: From the information provided, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, giving us prior probabilities of 0.25 for computer science and 0.75 for humanities. The description of Jason does not strongly indicate technical skills and seems more aligned with qualities often found in the humanities (e.g., creativity, imagination, emotional drive). Without additional specific information differentiating the fields in this study, the most statistically sound approach is to use the base rate. Given the base rates, and lacking strong evidence to deviate from them, the probability remains at 0.25.
