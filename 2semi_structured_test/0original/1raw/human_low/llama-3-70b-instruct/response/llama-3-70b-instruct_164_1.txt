{"probability": 0.1}

My reasoning is that the description of Jason does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. The description highlights his creativity, emotional drive, and passion, but does not mention technical skills, which are often associated with computer science. Additionally, the fact that he is "not particularly technical" suggests that he may not be a good fit for a technical field like computer science. Therefore, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is relatively low.
