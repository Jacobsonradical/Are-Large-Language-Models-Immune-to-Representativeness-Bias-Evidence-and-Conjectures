{"probability": 0.1}

My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. He is described as "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills typically associated with computer science. Additionally, his personality traits, such as being "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven", may be more commonly found in humanities professors. Therefore, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is relatively low.
