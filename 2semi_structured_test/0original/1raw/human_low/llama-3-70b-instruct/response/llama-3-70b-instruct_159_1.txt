My reasoning is that Jason's description suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor. The adjectives "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are more commonly associated with humanities fields, whereas computer science is often stereotypically associated with more technical and analytical personalities. Additionally, the fact that Jason is "not particularly technical" further supports this conclusion.
