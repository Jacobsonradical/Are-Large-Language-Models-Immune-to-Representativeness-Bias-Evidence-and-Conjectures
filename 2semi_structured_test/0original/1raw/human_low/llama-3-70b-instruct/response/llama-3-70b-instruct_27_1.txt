My reasoning is that the description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors, whereas computer science professors are often expected to be more technical and analytical. Therefore, I believe it is less likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
