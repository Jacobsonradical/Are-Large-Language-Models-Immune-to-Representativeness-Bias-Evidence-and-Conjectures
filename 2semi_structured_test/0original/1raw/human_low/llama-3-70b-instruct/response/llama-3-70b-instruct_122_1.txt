My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. He is described as "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills typically associated with computer science. Additionally, his personality traits, such as being "creative and imaginative" and enjoying "traveling, reading, and exploring", may be more commonly found in humanities professors.
