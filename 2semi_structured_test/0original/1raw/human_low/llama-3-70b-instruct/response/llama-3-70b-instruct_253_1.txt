{"probability": 0.1}

My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to match the stereotype of a computer science professor. He is described as "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science. Additionally, his creative and imaginative personality traits, as well as his enjoyment of traveling and exploring, may be more commonly found in humanities professors. Therefore, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is relatively low.
