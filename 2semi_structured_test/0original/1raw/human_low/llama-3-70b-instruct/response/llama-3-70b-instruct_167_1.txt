{"probability": "0.05"}

My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. He is described as "not particularly technical", which is an unusual trait for a computer science professor. Additionally, his personality traits, such as being "creative and imaginative" and enjoying "traveling, reading, and exploring", seem more aligned with the humanities. Therefore, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is low.
