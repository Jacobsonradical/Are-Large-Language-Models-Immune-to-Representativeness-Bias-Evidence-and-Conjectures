My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the typical stereotype of a computer science professor. The description highlights his creativity, emotional drive, and lack of technical skills, which are not typically associated with computer science. In contrast, humanities professors are often expected to be creative, imaginative, and passionate, which aligns with Jason's description. Therefore, I believe it is more likely that Jason is a humanities professor.
