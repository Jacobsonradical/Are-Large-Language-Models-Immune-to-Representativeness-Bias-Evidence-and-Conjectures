My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to match the typical stereotypes of a computer science professor. The description mentions that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills that are often associated with computer science. Additionally, the description highlights his creative and imaginative personality, which may be more commonly found in humanities professors. Therefore, I believe it is unlikely that Jason is a computer science professor.
