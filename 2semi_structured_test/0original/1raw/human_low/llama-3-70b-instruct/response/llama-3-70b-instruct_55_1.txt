My reasoning is that the description of Jason does not seem to match the stereotype of a computer science professor. The fact that he is described as "not particularly technical" suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills that are typically associated with computer science. Additionally, the emphasis on creativity, imagination, and emotional drive may be more characteristic of humanities professors.
