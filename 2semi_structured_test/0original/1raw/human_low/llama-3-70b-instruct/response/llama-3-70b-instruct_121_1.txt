{"probability": 0.1}

My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. The description mentions that Jason is "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills typically associated with computer science. Additionally, the description highlights his creative and imaginative personality, which may be more commonly associated with humanities professors. Therefore, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is relatively low.
