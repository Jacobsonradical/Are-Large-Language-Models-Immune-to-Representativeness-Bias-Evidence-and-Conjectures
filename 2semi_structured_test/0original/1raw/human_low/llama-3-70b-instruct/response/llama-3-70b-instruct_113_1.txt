My reasoning is that Jason's description does not seem to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor. He is described as "not particularly technical", which suggests that he may not have the strong technical skills typically associated with computer science. Additionally, his creative and imaginative personality, as well as his enjoyment of traveling and exploring, may be more commonly found in humanities professors.
