My reasoning is that Jason's description suggests that he is more likely to be a humanities professor. The description highlights his creative and imaginative nature, which is more commonly associated with humanities fields. Additionally, the fact that he is "not particularly technical" further supports this conclusion, as computer science is a field that typically requires strong technical skills.
