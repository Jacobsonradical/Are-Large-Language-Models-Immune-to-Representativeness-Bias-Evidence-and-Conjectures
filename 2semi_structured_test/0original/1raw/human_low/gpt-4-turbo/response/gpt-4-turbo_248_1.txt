Based on the description provided, with Jason being described as "often emotionally driven," "creative and imaginative," and "not particularly technical," but "gifted and passionate," it appears less likely that he is a computer science professor since these traits are more typically associated with the humanities. Considering the distribution of professors in the sample (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities), the likelihood leans towards Jason being a humanities professor.

Thus, estimating the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.2"}
