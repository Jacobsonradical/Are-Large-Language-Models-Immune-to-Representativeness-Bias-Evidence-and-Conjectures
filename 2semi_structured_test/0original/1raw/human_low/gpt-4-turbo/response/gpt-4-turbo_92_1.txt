Given the description of Jason as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," "gifted and passionate," and "though not particularly technical," we can infer that Jason might more likely fit the profile of a professor in the humanities rather than in computer science, especially noting the "not particularly technical" aspect.

Since the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, and the description fits more closely with typical humanities traits (particularly due to the emphasis on creativity, passion, and being less technical), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors appears lower. 

We know that:
- The sample size is 100 (25 computer science, 75 humanities).
- The description suggests a better fit for humanities.

Thus, the according probability would be:
- Probability = Number computer science professors / Total professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Adjusting this based on the provided description to reflect Jason possibly being less likely to be in computer science:
- The subjective adjustment based on description could further lower this probability.

As such, a reasonable estimate considering both the sample distribution and the traits described might be:
- Adjusted Probability: Lower than 0.25, around 0.15, considering the traits not typically associated with computer science.

Therefore, the final answer formatted as requested would be:
{"probability": "0.15"}
