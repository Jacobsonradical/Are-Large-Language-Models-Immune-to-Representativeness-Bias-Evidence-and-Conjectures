Based on the description of Jason, he appears to be imaginative, emotional, creative, and not particularly technical. These traits are typically more aligned with disciplines that rely on speculative, theoretical, and interpretative skills rather than technical expertise, suggesting that he aligns more with traits often found among humanities professors.

Considering there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample (75 humanities vs. 25 computer science), and given Jason's less technical orientation, the probability that he is a computer science professor is lower. Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.1"}
