Based on the description and characteristics given, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits tend to align more closely with typical attributes associated with professors in the humanities rather than those in computer science, who are often characterized by a more technical orientation.

Considering the distribution of the professors in the sample, with 25 from computer science and 75 from the humanities, the likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor is higher. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor seems lower.

For a numerical approximation, I take into account the distribution of professors and the matching of personality traits to typical disciplinary characteristics:
- Presence in group of computer science professors: 25% (25 out of 100)
- Matching personality traits typical to humanities as opposed to technical traits for computer science.

Combining these observations, my estimation of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors would be distinctly lower than 25%. An approximate value, considering the description, could be around:

{"probability": "0.1"}
