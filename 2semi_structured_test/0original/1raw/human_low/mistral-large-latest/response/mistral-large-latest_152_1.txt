{"probability": "0.3"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and enjoys reading and exploring. While these traits could be beneficial in either computer science or humanities, the fact that he is not described as particularly technical makes it less likely that he is a computer science professor. Therefore, I would assign a relatively low probability of 0.3 to the possibility that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
