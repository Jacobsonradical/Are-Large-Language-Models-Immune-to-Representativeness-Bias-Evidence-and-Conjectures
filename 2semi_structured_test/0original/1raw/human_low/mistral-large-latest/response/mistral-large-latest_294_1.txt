{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical suggests that he may be more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. However, the probability is not zero because there is still a chance that Jason could be a computer science professor who specializes in a less technical area or approaches his work in a more unconventional way.
