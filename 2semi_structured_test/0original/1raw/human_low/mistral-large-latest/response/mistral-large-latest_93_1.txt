{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, as well as his interests in traveling, reading, and exploring, and the mention that he is not particularly technical, suggest that he is more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. However, it is still possible that Jason is a computer science professor who specializes in a more creative and interdisciplinary area of the field, hence the probability is not zero.
