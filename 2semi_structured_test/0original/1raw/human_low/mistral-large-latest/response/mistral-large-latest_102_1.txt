{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical suggests that he may be more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. However, there is still a possibility that he could be a computer science professor who specializes in a more creative or theoretical area of the field, hence the probability is not zero.
