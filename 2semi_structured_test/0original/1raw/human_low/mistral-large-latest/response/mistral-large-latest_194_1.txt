The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and he enjoys reading and exploring. While these traits are not exclusive to any particular academic field, they seem more closely aligned with the humanities than computer science. Additionally, the statement that Jason is "not particularly technical" further suggests that he is more likely to be a professor in the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a subjective assessment based on limited information, and there is still a non-zero probability that Jason could be a computer science professor who specializes in a more theoretical or interdisciplinary area.
