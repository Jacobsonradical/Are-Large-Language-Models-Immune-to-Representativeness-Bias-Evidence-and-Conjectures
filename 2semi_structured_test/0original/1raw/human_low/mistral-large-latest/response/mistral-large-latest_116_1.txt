{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and enjoys reading and exploring, but is not particularly technical. While these traits could be found in both computer science and humanities professors, the lack of emphasis on technical skills and the mention of his passion for reading and exploring suggest that he may be more likely to be a professor in the humanities. However, this is just a probability, and it is possible that Jason could be a computer science professor who specializes in a more creative and imaginative subfield.
