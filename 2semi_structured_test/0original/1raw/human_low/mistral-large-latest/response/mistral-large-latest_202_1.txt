{"probability": "0.3"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason seems to possess traits more commonly associated with humanities professors, such as creativity, imagination, and emotional drive. Additionally, the fact that he is not described as particularly technical further suggests he may not be a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that personality traits alone cannot definitively determine an individual's field of expertise. Therefore, the probability is not 0, but rather a relatively low number.
