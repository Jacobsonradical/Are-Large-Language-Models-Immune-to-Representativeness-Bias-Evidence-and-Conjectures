A study aimed to identify common personality traits among successful academics was conducted. In this study, a panel of professional psychologists interviewed and administered personality tests to 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. Based on these personality tests, descriptions were written for each of the 100 professors.

You will be presented with one such description, chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Here is the description:
Jason is a 36-year-old, divorced man with no children. He is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical.

Now, please indicate your probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

Please give a number between 0 and 1, and answer the question in the following format:
