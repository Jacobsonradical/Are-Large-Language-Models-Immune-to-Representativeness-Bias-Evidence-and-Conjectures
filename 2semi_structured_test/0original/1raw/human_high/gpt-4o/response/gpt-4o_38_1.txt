Given Jason's description, it appears that his traits align more closely with those often found in the humanities rather than computer science, particularly since he is described as "not particularly technical." Considering that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and assuming personalities within each group are equally distributed, the prior probability would be \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) for a computer science professor and \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) for a humanities professor.

However, Jason's specific traits make him seem more humanities-oriented. Adjusting based on the description, the probability leans more heavily towards him being a humanities professor despite the baseline numbers.

After combining both the prior distribution and the description provided, an estimated probability might be lower than the baseline probability of 0.75. Evaluating this, a reasonable estimate could be around 0.2 to 0.3 for being a computer science professor.
