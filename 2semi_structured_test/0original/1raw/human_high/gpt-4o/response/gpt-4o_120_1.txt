{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Given the description of Jason, it seems more aligned with the common traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason belongs to one of the 25 humanities professors rather than the 75 computer science professors. Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is lower, approximately 0.25.
