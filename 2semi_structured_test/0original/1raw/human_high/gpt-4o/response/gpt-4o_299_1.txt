Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have more traits typically associated with the humanities rather than computer science. Given the study sample, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 or 0.75. However, the provided description fits more closely with common stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). So, we might adjust our probability downward from the prior based on this information.

After considering the provided description and the initial proportions, I'd estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors as follows:

{"probability": "0.3"}
