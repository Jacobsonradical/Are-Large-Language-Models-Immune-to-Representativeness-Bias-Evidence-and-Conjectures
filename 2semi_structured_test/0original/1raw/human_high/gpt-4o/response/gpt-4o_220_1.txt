Based on the given description of Jason, it seems that his traits are more aligned with those commonly associated with humanities professionals, such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, rather than traits typically associated with computer science professionals, like being technical.

We can apply Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here is the application of relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Assuming the description provided is more likely to fit humanities professors, let's denote the likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor as \( P(D|CS) \), and given he is a humanities professor as \( P(D|H) \).

   Based on qualitative judgment:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) (the likelihood of seeing such a description in a computer science professor) is relatively low — let's say 0.1 for illustration.
   - \( P(D|H) \) (the likelihood of seeing such a description in a humanities professor) is relatively high — let's say 0.8 for illustration.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes’ theorem: \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \).
