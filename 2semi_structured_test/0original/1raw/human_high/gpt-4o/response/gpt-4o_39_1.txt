{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the description of Jason and based on the professions generally requiring creativity and imagination over technical skills, it seems more likely he belongs to the humanities group. However, about the base rate of the sample: 75% are computer science professors and 25% are humanities professors. Balancing the description with the base rate, there's still a chance Jason could be one of the computer science professors, but it's less likely considering his described traits.
