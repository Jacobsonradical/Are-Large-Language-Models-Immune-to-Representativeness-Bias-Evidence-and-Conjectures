Given the information provided and without any additional bias or assumptions, we should base our answer on the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample.

Out of 100 professors:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The probability that a randomly picked professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

However, the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical matches stereotypical traits more commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science. This fits a stereotype of humanities professors. Nonetheless, we must be cautious not to let stereotypes unduly influence our judgment and rely strictly on the given probabilities (Bayes' theorem would require more detailed prior and likelihood probabilities which are not provided here).

To balance between the stereotype and given data without specific prior probabilities for the description match, still, the base rate should be strongly considered. Therefore, the overall balance still leans towards the numerical predominance.

Considering an adjustment for the description fitting more as a humanities professor:
Adjusting for potential stereotype, slightly reducing the base rate probability for CS.

{\(0.75\) } slightly adjusted \( \approx 0.35 \)

Thus, adhering straightforwardly to Bayesian principles on priors and recognizing the stereotype influence in moderation:

{\("probability": "0.35"} \)
