To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates and the given description. Here are some details to weigh:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason includes traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, and being gifted and passionate but not particularly technical.

The description seems more aligned with typical characteristics often associated with humanities professors rather than those generally expected in computer science. However, we need to use the base rates and the provided description to calculate the probability rigorously.

Let's use Bayes' theorem for this calculation. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS|D) \)) given the description (\( D \)).

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(C
