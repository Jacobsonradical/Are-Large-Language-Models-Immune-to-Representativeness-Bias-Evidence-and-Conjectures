Given the description of Jason and taking into account the prevalence of computer science vs humanities professors in the sample, here's the calculation we can perform.

First, consider the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor \( P(Hum) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given the description, Jason seems to fit more closely with typical traits often found in humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), as opposed to the stereotype of a computer science professor. However, we must also consider the base rates.

Using Bayes' theorem to update the probability:
- Let \( D \) be the description that fits with typical humanities professor traits.
- \( P(D|CS) \) would be the likelihood of the traits if Jason were a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) would be the likelihood of the traits if Jason were a humanities professor.

Assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is low, say 0.2 (since the description does not fit well with computer science professors).
- \( P(D|Hum) \) is high, say 0.8.

Now, calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS)
