{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation:
There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75/100 or 0.75, and from the humanities, it is 25/100 or 0.25. However, the description provided for Jason fits more closely with traits typically associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Given this fit, it is more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors. Thus, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be lower than the prior probability, approximately 0.25.
