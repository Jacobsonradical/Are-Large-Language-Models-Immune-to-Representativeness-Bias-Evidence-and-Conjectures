{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the fact that only 75 out of the 100 professors are computer science professors, while 25 are humanities professors. Regardless of the description given, without further specific data linking personality traits to the fields, the base rate suggests a 75% chance that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor and a 25% chance that it belongs to a humanities professor. Given Jasonâ€™s description, which aligns more with common traits in the humanities, applying the base rate in this Bayesian inference context yields the lower probability assigned here.
