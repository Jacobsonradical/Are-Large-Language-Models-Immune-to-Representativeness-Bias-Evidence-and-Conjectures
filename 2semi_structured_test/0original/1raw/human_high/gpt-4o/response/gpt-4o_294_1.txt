{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability is derived from the fact that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The base rate of computer science professors is 75%, and humanities professors is 25%. Given that the description of Jason fits more closely with typical characteristics associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), the likelihood he belongs to the smaller group (humanities professors) is higher, thus giving a probability bias towards the 25 humanities professors. Therefore, despite the base rates, the characteristics described make it more probable that Jason is a humanities professor.
