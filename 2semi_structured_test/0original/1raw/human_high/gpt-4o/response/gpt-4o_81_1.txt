{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the ratio of computer science professors to the total sample size. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, meaning 3/4 are from computer science. However, the description suggests more characteristics typical of humanities professors than of computer scientists, such as being emotionally driven, creative, and not particularly technical. Given this mismatch, the probability is adjusted down from the base rate of 0.75 to reflect these trait patterns.
