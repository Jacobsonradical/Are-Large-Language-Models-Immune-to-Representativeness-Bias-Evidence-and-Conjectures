{"probability": "0.2"}

In this case, Jason's description aligns more closely with traits typically found in humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) rather than computer science professors. Given that there are fewer humanities professors (25) than computer science professors (75), Jason's description being randomly chosen from the humanities group seems more likely, but not exclusively so. Thus, the probability reflects a balance between the number of professors in each group and the descriptors that match more closely to the humanities profile.
