{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability is based on the proportion of computer science professors (75 out of 100) and humanities professors (25 out of 100) in the study. Given the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, it aligns more with common stereotypes of humanities professors than those in computer science, who might be perceived as more technical. Therefore, the probability is adjusted downwards from the base rate, but this is admittedly a subjective estimation.
