{"probability": "0.2"}

Explanation: Initially, there is a base rate of 75/100 (or 0.75) that Jason could be a computer science professor, and 25/100 (or 0.25) that he could be a humanities professor. However, the description of Jason suggests traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which align more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Given this profile, it's reasonable to adjust the probability to reflect a higher likelihood that Jason is from the humanities group. Therefore, considering both the base rates and the descriptive information, a revised estimate of 0.2 for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor seems appropriate.
