{"probability": "0.2"}

This estimate takes into account the base rates provided in the study: 75% of the participants were computer science professors, and 25% were humanities professors. Jason's description aligns more closely with typical descriptions of humanities professors, which skews the probability towards the lower end of the computer science group despite the base rate.
