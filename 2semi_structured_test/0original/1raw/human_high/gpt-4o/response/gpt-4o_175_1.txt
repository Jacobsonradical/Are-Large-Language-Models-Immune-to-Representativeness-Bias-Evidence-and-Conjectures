Based on the given description of Jason, he appears to exhibit traits more commonly associated with professionals in the humanities, such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. However, we must also consider the base rates, or the prior probabilities, of the two groups in the study: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we utilize Bayes' Theorem:

1. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \( B \) be the event that Jason matches the description provided.

We seek \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\text{not-}A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We hypothesize that \( P(B \mid A) \) (the probability of matching the description given that Jason is a computer science professor) is relatively low since the description fits a humanities professor better. Let's assume a small value \( \epsilon \approx 0.1 \).

For humanities professors, the probability \( P(B \mid \text{not-}A) \) of matching the description is higher, let's assume \( \
