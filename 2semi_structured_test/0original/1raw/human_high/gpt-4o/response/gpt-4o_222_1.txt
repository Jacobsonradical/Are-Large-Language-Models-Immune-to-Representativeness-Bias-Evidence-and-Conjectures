{"probability": "0.25"}

Given the context, the traits described for Jason—such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical—align more closely with the attributes often associated with humanities professors. Moreover, the base rate information indicates that only 25 out of the 100 professors are from the humanities, which drives the calculation. Hence, considering both the personality description and the proportion of professors in each group (75 in computer science and 25 in humanities), the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors is relatively low.
