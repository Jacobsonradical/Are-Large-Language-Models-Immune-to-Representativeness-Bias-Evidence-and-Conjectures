Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

However, based on the personality description provided for Jason, criteria such as being not particularly technical, emotionally driven, and imaginative might more strongly correlate with humanities professors.

To estimate probabilities, we use the following approach:
1. **Base Rate (Prior Probability)**: The initial likelihood of being a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), and being a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
2. **Likelihood (Likelihood of the Description Given the Type of Professorship)**: Let's denote the likelihood of someone fitting Jason's description given they are a computer science professor as \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and given they are a humanities professor as \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

Given the description leans towards traits more common in humanities, we might subjectively decide:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood as the traits are not strongly technical)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (higher likelihood as the traits match more closely)

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]
