{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: This estimate considers the base rates of the two groups in the sample (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors) and the personality description provided. Although the description has characteristics that could fit either group, it seems to align slightly more with humanities professors, affecting the probability estimate. Thus, the relatively smaller base rate of humanities professors tilts the probability towards them, but it does not overwhelmingly discount the possibility of Jason being a computer science professor.
