{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Given that the description suggests Jason is not particularly technical and has interests and traits that align more with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), it seems more likely that he is one of the humanities professors. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher likelihood based purely on numbers that he could be from the larger group (computer science). However, the description better fits traits we might expect from a humanities professor. Balancing these factors, I'd estimate a lower probability for him being a computer science professor.
