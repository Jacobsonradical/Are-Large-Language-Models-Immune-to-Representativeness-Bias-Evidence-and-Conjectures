{"probability": "0.1"}

To arrive at this answer, consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The description of Jason suggests traits more commonly associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), which leads to a lower subjective likelihood of him being in the computer science group despite the larger number of computer science professors. Balancing these factors, a probability of 0.1 reflects the lower likelihood based on his description and the base rates.
