To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll need to consider both the base rates (priors) and the personality description.

We know the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Using these base rates, the probability of selecting a computer science professor at random is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability of selecting a humanities professor at random is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, considering the personality description provided, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits might not be as strongly associated with a technical field like computer science as they are with the humanities. However, this alone is subjective and we lack precise conditional probabilities.

Since the description does not strongly point toward either group and considering the base rate (75% computer science vs. 25% humanities), we might adjust slightly but still heavily rely on the base rate:

However, given the context, let's slightly adjust for the likely higher proportion of "creative" individuals in humanities. We assume \( P(Description|CS) \approx 0.6 \) and \( P(Description|Hum) \approx 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) * P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) * P(Hum)
