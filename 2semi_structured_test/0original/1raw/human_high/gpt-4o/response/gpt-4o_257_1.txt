{"probability": "0.2"}

Given the description of Jason, several characteristics such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical suggest that he may fit more closely with the general stereotypes associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Additionally, the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, meaning there is a 3:1 ratio in favor of Jason being a computer science professor purely by chance.

However, the description tilts towards qualities often attributed to those in humanities, thus reducing the likelihood. Combining the stereotypical alignment with the base rate, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be 0.2.
