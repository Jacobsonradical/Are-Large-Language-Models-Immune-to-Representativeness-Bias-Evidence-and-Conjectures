{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 3 to 1, or 0.75.

However, based on Jason's description, he seems to exhibit traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring) that align more closely with common perceptions of humanities professors.

Considering this, the probability estimate skews towards the humanities group.

So, I adjust the base rate probability down accordingly.

The overall probability of Jason being a computer science professor is around 0.25.
