{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that Jason is described as emotionally driven, creative, and imaginative, and not particularly technical, these attributes align more with typical humanities traits rather than computer science. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and Jason's profile fits better with the smaller humanities sample, we can use the base rate (75% probability for computer science vs. 25% for humanities) tailored by the description suitability. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability for the computer science sample.
