{"probability": "0.25"}

This probability is based on the ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the base rate probability 0.75 for a computer science professor and 0.25 for a humanities professor. However, given Jason's description, which matches more closely with the stereotypes of a humanities professor, I am inclined to weight these base rates heavily in favor of the humanities. Thus, the final probability is influenced heavily by the base rate but adjusted down due to the unlikeliness of a computer science professor matching Jason's description.
