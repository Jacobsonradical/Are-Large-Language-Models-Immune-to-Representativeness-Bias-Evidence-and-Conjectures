{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any given individual being a computer science professor is 0.75 (75/100), and being a humanities professor is 0.25 (25/100). However, Jason's description aligns more closely with stereotypical traits associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). Therefore, despite the base rate suggesting a higher likelihood of a computer science professor, the specific descriptive traits shift the probability more toward him being in the humanities.

Considering both the base rate and the descriptive information, the estimated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.25.
