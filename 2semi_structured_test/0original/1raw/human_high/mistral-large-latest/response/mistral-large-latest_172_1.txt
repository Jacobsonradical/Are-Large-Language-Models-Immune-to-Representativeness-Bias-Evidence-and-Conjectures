{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits may be more commonly associated with professors in the humanities than in computer science. However, it is important to note that personality traits alone may not be a reliable indicator of a person's academic field, and there is still a possibility that Jason is a computer science professor. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.3, based on the information provided.
