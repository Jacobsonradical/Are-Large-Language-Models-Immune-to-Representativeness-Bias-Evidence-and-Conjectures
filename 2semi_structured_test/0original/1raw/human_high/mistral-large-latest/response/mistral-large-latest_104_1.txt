{"probability": "0.3"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and enjoys activities such as traveling and reading. While these traits are not exclusive to any particular academic field, they may be more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science. Additionally, the statement that Jason is "not particularly technical" further supports the likelihood that he is a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low, at around 0.3.
