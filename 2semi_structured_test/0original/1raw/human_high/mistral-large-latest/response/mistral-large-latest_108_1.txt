{"probability": "0.3"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and enjoys reading and exploring, which could be characteristics of either a computer science or humanities professor. However, the statement that he is not particularly technical makes it less likely that he is a computer science professor. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.3.
