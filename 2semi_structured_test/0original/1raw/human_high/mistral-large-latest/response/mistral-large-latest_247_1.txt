{"probability": "0.3"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. It also mentions that he is not particularly technical. Given that computer science is a highly technical field, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, since creativity and imagination can also be valuable traits in computer science, it's not impossible, hence the probability is not zero. But it's lower than 0.5, as the description appears to be more in line with a professor in the humanities.
