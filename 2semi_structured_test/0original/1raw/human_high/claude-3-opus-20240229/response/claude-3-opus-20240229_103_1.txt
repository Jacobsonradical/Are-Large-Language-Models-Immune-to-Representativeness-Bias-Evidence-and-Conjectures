Here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the personality description, Jason seems much more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. His traits of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical align more with typical humanities professors. Computer science professors tend to be more analytical and technically-oriented.

Additionally, the sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So there is only a 25% baseline probability of Jason being a humanities professor if no other information was given.

Combining the base rate of 25% humanities professors with the personality description that seems much more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, I estimate only a 15% chance that Jason is actually one of the computer science professors in the sample.
