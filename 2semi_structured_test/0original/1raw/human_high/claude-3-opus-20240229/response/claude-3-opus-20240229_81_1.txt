Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because these are generalizations and there can certainly be computer science professors with Jason's traits. The given sample also contains 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so from a pure base rate perspective, there is still a reasonable chance Jason could be a computer science professor.
