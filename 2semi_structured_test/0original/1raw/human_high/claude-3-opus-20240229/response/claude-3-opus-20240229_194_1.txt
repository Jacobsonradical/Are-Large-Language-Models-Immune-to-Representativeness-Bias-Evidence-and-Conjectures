Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." These traits and interests align more typically with someone in the humanities rather than computer science, which tends to attract more analytical, technical, and quantitative thinkers.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the specific details for Jason seem much more characteristic of the humanities group.

Weighing the base rates against the individuating information, I'd estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor at around 20%.
