Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, but not particularly technical. Computer science professors usually have strong technical skills and a more analytical mindset.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality traits, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
