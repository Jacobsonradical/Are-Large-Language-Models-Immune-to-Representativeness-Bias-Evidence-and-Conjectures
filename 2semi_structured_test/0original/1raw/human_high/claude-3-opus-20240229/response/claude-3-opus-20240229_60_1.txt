{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more aligned with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which seems at odds with being a successful computer science professor.

Given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 0.75. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from computer science, so I would estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor as much lower than this prior, around 0.25.
