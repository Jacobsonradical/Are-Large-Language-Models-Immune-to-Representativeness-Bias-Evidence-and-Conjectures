Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities field.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is relatively low.
