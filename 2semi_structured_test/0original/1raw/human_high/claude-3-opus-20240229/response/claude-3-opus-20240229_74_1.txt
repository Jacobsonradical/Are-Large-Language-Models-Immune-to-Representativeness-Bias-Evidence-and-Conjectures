Based on the description provided, my assessment is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The personality traits and interests described for Jason - being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying traveling, reading and exploring - seem more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. The mention that he is "not particularly technical" also suggests he is less likely to be in computer science.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because certainly some computer science professors may fit this general description, even if it is not the most common profile. The 0.15 probability reflects that while I believe it is more likely Jason is one of the 25 humanities professors, there is still some chance he could be one of the 75 computer science professors sampled.
