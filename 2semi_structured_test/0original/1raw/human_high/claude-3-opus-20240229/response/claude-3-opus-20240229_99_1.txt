Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. While computer science professors can certainly possess these qualities, the field generally attracts individuals with strong technical skills and analytical thinking.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
