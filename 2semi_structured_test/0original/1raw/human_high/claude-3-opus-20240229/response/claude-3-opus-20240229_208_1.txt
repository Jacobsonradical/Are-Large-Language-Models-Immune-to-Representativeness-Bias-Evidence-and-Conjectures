Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative, and not particularly technical, which are traits that may be more commonly associated with professors in the humanities.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
