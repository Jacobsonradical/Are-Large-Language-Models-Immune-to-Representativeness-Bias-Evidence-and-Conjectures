From the given description, Jason sounds more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, we should be cautious about stereotyping. There certainly can be computer science professors who fit Jason's description. The small sample sizes (75 CS professors vs 25 humanities professors) also mean we can't draw definitive conclusions.

Still, if I had to give a probability based solely on the description provided, I would estimate it as follows:

{"probability": "0.3"}
