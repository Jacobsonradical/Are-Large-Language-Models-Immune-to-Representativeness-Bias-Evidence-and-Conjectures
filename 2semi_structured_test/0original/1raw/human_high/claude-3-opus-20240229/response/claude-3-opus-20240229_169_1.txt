Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Computer science professors are likely to be more analytical and technical in their skills and interests.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
