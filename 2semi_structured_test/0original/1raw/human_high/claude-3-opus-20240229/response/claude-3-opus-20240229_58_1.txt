Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality traits align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
