Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven and passionate, but not particularly technical. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills.

Also, the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without additional information, there would only be a 25% chance of randomly selecting a humanities professor.

Putting this together, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.15"}
