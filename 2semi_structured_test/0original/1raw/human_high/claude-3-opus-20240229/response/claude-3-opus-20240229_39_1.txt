Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative and imaginative rather than technical. His interests also seem to align more with the humanities.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits and interests, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
