Based on the description provided, Jason seems to exhibit traits and interests more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key trait often found in successful computer science professors.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described characteristics, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
