Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Computer science professors often have strong technical skills and a more analytical mindset.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
