To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the following:

1. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So, without any additional information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

2. The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are more typically associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

3. The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical," which further suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given this information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor seems considerably lower than the prior probability of 0.75. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.20 or 20%.
