Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading and exploring. It also notes he is not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Given the study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess based solely on the limited information provided, I would estimate there is only about a 25% chance Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
