Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate - traits that are often more associated with the humanities than with technical fields like computer science. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the details in this description are more consistent with a humanities background.

Without more specific information to go on, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, perhaps around 10-20%. Here is my answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.15"}
