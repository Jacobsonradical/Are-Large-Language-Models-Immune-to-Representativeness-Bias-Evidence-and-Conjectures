{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are often associated more with the humanities than computer science.

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor, as technical skills are typically a core requirement in that field.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate there is only around a 10% chance (0.1 probability) that he is one of the computer science professors.
