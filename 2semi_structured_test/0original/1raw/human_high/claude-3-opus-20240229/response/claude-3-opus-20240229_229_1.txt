Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. Key traits like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying reading and exploring align more with a humanities background. The mention of him not being particularly technical also points away from computer science.

However, there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor, as the field can attract some imaginative and passionate individuals. But given the limited information, I'd put the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at only around 15%.
