Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description explicitly states Jason is not very technical, the probability of him being one of the computer science professors in the sample appears to be quite low.

However, it's important to note that the description is just one data point and may not capture all aspects of Jason's personality and skills. Additionally, the question does not provide information about the distribution of these traits among the professors in the two groups.

With these caveats in mind, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
