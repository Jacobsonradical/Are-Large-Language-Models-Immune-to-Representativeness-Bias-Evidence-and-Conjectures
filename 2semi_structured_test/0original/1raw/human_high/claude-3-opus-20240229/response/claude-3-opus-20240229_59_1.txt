{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have personality traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which seems less aligned with a typical computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking any other information to differentiate Jason, the base rate probability of him being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details in his description seem more representative of the humanities group. 

Therefore, I estimate that there is approximately a 25% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, and a 75% chance that he belongs to the humanities professor group.
