Based on the given description, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities or creative fields.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
