{"probability": "0.15"}

Based on the description, Jason seems to have traits and interests more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science. Being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring suggests he may be more likely to be one of the humanities professors in the sample.

The fact that he is described as "not particularly technical" further reduces the probability that he is a computer science professor, as technical skills and interests are usually important in that field.

However, there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor, as individuals can have diverse traits and the sample of computer science professors was larger (75 vs 25). But given the limited information, the probability seems relatively low, so I estimated around 0.15 or 15%.
