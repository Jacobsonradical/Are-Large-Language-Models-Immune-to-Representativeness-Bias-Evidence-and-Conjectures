Based on the description provided, here is my estimate:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The key factors influencing this estimate are:

1. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits are more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science.

2. His interests in traveling, reading, and exploring also seem more aligned with a humanities background. 

3. Most tellingly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical". This makes it less likely that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because these are generalizations and stereotypes. There can certainly be computer science professors who fit Jason's description. But based on the limited information provided, a humanities background seems more probable than computer science for Jason.
