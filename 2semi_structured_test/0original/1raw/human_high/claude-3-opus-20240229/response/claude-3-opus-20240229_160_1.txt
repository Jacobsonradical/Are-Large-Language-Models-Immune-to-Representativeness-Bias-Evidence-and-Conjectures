Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, passion, and interest in activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science professors.

However, it's important to note that individual traits can vary, and there can certainly be creative and less technical individuals in computer science as well. The small sample size of humanities professors (25) compared to computer science professors (75) in the study should also be considered, as it means we have less information about the typical traits of the humanities group.

Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low, perhaps around 0.2.
