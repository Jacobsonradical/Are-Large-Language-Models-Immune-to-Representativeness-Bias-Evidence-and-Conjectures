Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative" and "not particularly technical", which are traits more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than in a technical field like computer science.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering the description of Jason's personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
