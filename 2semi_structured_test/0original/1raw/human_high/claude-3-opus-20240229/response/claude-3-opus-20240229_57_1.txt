Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative" and "not particularly technical", which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields rather than technical fields like computer science.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.15"}
