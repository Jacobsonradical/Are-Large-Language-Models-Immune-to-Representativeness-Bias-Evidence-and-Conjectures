Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical traits associated with computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also mentions that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's personality traits and the fact that he is not particularly technical, it seems more likely that he belongs to the group of humanities professors.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
