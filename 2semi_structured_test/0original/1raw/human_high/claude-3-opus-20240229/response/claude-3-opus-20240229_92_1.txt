Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more typical of professors in the humanities rather than computer science. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technically oriented.

However, without more detailed information, it's difficult to say definitively. There is certainly a possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor, as individuals can have a wide range of personalities and interests. The 0.2 probability reflects that while it seems less likely given the description, it can't be ruled out entirely based on this information alone.
