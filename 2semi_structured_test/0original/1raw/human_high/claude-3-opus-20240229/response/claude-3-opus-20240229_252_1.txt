Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability is relatively low, as Jason's personality and interests seem more aligned with the humanities than computer science.
