To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Key points:
1. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might suggest a humanities background more than a technical one like computer science.
2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, which could fit either group.
3. Most notably, Jason is described as "not particularly technical," which strongly suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.
4. The base rate in the sample is 75% computer science professors (75 out of 100).

Given the description, especially the mention of Jason being "not particularly technical," it seems more likely that he belongs to the humanities group. However, we should not entirely discount the possibility of him being a computer science professor, as the base rate is relatively high (75%).

Considering all factors, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.3"}
