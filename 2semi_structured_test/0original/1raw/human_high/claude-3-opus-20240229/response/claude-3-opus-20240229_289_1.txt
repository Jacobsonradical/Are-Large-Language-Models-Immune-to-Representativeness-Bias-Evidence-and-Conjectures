Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." These traits and interests align more closely with stereotypical characteristics of humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

However, it's important not to rely too heavily on stereotypes, as there is certainly individual variation. Some computer science professors may well have Jason's profile. And the prior odds of Jason being a computer science professor are 75%, given the composition of the sample.

Weighing the base rates and description, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at around 35%:
