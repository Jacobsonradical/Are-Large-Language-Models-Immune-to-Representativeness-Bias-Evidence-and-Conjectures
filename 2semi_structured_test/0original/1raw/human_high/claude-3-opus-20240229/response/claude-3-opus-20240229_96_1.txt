Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being in computer science.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.1 or 10%.
