Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which aligns more with traits often associated with humanities fields rather than computer science.

Given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking other distinguishing information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.3"}
