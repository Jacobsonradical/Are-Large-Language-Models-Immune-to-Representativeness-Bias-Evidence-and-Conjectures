Based on the description provided, here is my assessment:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like reading and exploring, but not as particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. 

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality and interests, I estimate there is only about a 15% probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
