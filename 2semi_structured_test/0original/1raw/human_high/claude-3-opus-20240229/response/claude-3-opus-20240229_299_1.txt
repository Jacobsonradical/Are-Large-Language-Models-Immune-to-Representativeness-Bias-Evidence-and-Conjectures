The personality description of Jason does not seem to align closely with typical traits associated with computer science professors. Key points:

- He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, traits more commonly associated with humanities fields.
- Enjoying traveling, reading and exploring suggests wide-ranging intellectual curiosity, but not necessarily a technical focus.  
- Being gifted and passionate could apply to any academic, but it explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.
- The description does not mention any computer science related skills, interests or accomplishments.

Given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base probability of a randomly selected profile being a computer science professor is 75%. 

However, the specific details in Jason's description strongly suggest he is more likely to be one of the humanities professors. Weighing the base rates against the description, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be quite low, around 10%:
