Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while computer science is a highly technical field. Additionally, traits like being "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are more commonly associated with humanities and arts rather than STEM fields.

Given that the study sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
