Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key skill for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details about Jason strongly suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
