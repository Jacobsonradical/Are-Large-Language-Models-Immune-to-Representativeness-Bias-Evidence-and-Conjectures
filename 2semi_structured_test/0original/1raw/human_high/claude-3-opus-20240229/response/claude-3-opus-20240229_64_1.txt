Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key characteristic for success in computer science academia. Additionally, traits like being "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are more commonly associated with humanities fields rather than technical ones like computer science.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low:

{"probability": "0.1"}
