Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The passage portrays him as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and that the description emphasizes Jason's creative and emotional qualities over technical skills, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample is fairly low, perhaps around 0.2.
