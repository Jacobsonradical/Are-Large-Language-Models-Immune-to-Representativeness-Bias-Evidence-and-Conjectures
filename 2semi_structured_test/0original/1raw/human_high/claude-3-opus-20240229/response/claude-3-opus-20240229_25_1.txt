Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading and exploration. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being a computer science professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low, perhaps around 10-20%.
