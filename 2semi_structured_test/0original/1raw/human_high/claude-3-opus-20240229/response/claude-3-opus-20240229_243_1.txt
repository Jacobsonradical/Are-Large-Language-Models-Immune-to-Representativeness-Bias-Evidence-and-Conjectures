Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." These traits align more closely with stereotypical characteristics of humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

However, it's important not to rely too heavily on stereotypes. There is individual variation within both fields. Some computer science professors may well be creative, imaginative and passionate about non-technical pursuits. And the description provides limited information to make a confident judgment.

Given the small sample size, with 75% being computer science professors, I'll estimate a 30% chance that Jason is a computer science professor. But I acknowledge significant uncertainty in this estimate.
