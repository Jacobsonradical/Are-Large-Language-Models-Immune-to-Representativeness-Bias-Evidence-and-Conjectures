To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the key information given:

1. The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring.
3. Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical."

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills, which Jason is noted to lack.

However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that Jason is a computer science professor, as the field also benefits from creativity and imagination.

Considering the sample size and Jason's description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability indicates that while it's possible Jason is a computer science professor, it seems more likely, based on his description and the composition of the sample, that he is one of the humanities professors.
