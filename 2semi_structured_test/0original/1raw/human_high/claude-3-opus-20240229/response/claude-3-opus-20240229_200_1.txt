Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven rather than being particularly technical, which would be more common traits for someone in the humanities.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
