Based on the provided description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, as well as passionate about non-technical pursuits like traveling and exploring. This personality profile seems more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. 

However, there is still some possibility Jason could be a computer science professor, as the field can attract a diverse range of personality types. The 0.2 probability estimate reflects that while it seems less likely given his profile, it cannot be ruled out entirely without more information.
