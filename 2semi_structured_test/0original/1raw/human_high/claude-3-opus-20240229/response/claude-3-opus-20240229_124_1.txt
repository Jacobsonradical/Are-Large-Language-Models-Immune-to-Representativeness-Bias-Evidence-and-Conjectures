Based on the description provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative" and "often emotionally driven", which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being a computer science professor.
