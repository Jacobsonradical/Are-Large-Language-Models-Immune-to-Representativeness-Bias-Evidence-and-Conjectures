Based on the description provided, Jason does not appear to fit the stereotypical personality traits often associated with computer science professors. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical - traits more commonly ascribed to those in the humanities.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking any other information, the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75%. 

However, the details in his description are more consistent with a humanities professor, so I would estimate the probability somewhat lower than the base rate.
