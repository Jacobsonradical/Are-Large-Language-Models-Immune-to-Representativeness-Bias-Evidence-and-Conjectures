Based on the limited information provided about Jason, he does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, the lack of technical inclination suggests Jason is more likely to be one of the humanities professors in the sample.

However, it's important to note that individual traits can vary, and the description alone is not enough to make a definitive judgment. Some computer science professors may also have diverse interests and creative personalities.

Considering the information given and the fact that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}
