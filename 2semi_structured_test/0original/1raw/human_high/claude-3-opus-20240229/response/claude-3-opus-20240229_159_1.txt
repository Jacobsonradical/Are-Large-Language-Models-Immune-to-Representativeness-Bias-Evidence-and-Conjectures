Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while being creative, imaginative and emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities and arts rather than computer science.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
