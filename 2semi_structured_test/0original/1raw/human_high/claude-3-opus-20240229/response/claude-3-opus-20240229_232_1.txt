Given the limited information in the description, it's challenging to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, a few clues suggest he may be more likely to be a humanities professor:

- Being described as "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are traits more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science. 
- Enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring also seem to fit more with a humanities background.
- Most tellingly, he is described as "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Of course, these are generalizations and there is much individual variation. Some computer science professors certainly fit this profile too. But if I had to estimate a probability based solely on the details provided, I'd say there is only about a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor, and a 75% chance he is a humanities professor.
