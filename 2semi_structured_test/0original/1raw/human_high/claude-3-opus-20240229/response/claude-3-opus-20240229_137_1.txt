Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. However, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key trait often associated with computer science professors.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would assign a relatively low probability of him being one of the computer science professors.
