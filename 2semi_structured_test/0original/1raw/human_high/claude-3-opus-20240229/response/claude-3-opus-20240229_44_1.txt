Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like travel, reading and exploring - traits more stereotypically associated with humanities than computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that 75% of the sample are computer science professors, if I had no individuating information my prior probability would be 0.75 that Jason is a computer science professor. However, the details provided are more consistent with the stereotype of a humanities professor.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
