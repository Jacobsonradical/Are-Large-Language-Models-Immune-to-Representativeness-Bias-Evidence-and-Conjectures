To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the following:

1. The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

2. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science.

3. Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical," which strongly suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given this information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be significantly lower than the prior probability of 0.75.
