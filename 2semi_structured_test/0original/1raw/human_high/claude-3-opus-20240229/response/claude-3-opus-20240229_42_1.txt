Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technically-oriented.

However, without more comprehensive data on the typical traits of both groups, I can't completely rule out the possibility that Jason is a computer science professor. Individual differences always exist. So while I believe it's more likely Jason is one of the 25 humanities professors, I wouldn't assign an extremely low probability to him being one of the 75 computer science professors.
