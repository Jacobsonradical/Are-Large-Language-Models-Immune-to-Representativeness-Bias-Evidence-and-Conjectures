Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more stereotypically associated with humanities than computer science. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical."

However, these are broad generalizations and individuals can certainly deviate from stereotypes. Without more specific information, it's difficult to assign a probability with high confidence. The base rates (75% computer science, 25% humanities) provide a reasonable starting point to adjust from, but there are too many unknowns to drastically deviate from those base rates.
