To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description.

Key points:
1. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring.
3. Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical."

Given that the majority of the professors in the study are from computer science (75%), one might initially assume a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. However, the description of Jason as "not particularly technical" is a strong indicator that he is more likely to be a humanities professor. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills and inclinations.

Considering this information, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
