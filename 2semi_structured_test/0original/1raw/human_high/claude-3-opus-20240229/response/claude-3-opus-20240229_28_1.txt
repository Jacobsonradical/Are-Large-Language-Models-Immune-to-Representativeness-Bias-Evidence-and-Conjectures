The description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which makes it less likely that he is a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details about Jason make it more probable that he belongs to the humanities group.
