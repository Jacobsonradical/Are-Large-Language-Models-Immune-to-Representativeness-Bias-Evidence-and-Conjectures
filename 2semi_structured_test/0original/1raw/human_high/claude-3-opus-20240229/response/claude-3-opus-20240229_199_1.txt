Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a confident assessment. However, based on the description, Jason seems more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while being "not particularly technical". Computer science professors often have strong technical skills.

Without more data on the distribution of these traits across both groups, I'll make an educated guess that there is only a 20% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.
