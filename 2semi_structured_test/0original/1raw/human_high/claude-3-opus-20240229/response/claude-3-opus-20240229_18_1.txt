Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical." Computer science professors are usually highly technical individuals.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with humanities than computer science, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This probability is relatively low, reflecting that Jason's profile seems more suited to a humanities professor than a computer science professor based on the limited information provided.
