To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring.
- Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical".

Given that the majority of the sample (75%) are computer science professors, our prior probability would be 0.75. However, the description of Jason as "not particularly technical" is a strong indicator that he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Therefore, despite the base rates favoring computer science, the specific description of Jason suggests a lower probability that he is a computer science professor.
