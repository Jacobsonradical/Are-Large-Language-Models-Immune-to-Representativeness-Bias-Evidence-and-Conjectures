Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about exploring and reading, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, individuals can certainly break the mold of stereotypes. Without more specific information, I would put the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in the sample at around 0.2 or 20%, since computer science professors make up 75% of the overall sample but Jason's described traits seem less typical for that field based on common perceptions. But this is a tentative estimate given the very limited data about Jason and the sample.
