{"probability": "0.1"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about fields like traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor. Computer science typically requires strong technical skills and a more analytical mindset.

Given the limited information provided and the general stereotypes associated with the two fields, I estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.1 (or 10%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The traits described seem to align more closely with the humanities.
