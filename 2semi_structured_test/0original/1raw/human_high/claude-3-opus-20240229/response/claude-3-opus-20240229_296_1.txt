Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about exploring and reading, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 humanities professors and 75 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
