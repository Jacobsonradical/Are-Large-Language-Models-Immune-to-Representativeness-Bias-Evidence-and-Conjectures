Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative and imaginative rather than technical. His interests also seem to align more with the humanities (traveling, reading, exploring) rather than computer science.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking any other information, the base rate probability that a randomly selected individual would be a computer science professor is 75%. 

However, the details in Jason's description make it less likely that he is part of the computer science group. Weighing the base rate against the description, I estimate the probability to be lower than the 75% base rate, but not extremely low since there is still some possibility that Jason could be an atypical computer science professor.
