Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits often associated with the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills typically required for computer science.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
