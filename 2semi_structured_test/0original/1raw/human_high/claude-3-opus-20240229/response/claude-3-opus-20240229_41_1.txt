{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which further suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 humanities professors and 75 computer science professors in the sample, and lacking any other information to distinguish Jason, I'd estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor at 0.25 (25%).
