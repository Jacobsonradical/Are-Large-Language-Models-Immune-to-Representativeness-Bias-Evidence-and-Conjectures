Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate - traits that are often associated more with the humanities than with technical fields like computer science. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical".

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being in computer science.

Considering all this, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low, around 0.1 or 10%.
