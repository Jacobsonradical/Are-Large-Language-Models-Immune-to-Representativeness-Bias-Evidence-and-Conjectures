Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits more stereotypically associated with humanities fields. Importantly, it also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical", which is atypical for a computer science professor.

Given there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the details provided are more consistent with the stereotype of a humanities professor.

Weighing the base rate of 75% against the description that seems inconsistent with a computer science background, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be around 30%.
