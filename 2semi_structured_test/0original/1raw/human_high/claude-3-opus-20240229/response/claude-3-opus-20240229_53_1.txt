Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also states that he is "not particularly technical."

Computer science professors usually have a strong technical background and are more focused on analytical and logical thinking. While creativity and imagination are valuable in any field, the description of Jason seems to align more closely with someone in the humanities.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as relatively low.
