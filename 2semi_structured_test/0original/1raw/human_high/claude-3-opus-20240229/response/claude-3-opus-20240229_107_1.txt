Based on the description provided, my probability estimate that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like traveling, reading, and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical". 

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description seems more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors, I believe there is a relatively low probability (around 20%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
