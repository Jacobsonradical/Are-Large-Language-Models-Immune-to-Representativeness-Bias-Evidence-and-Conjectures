Here is my response:

{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. A few key details point to this:

- He is described as "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven". While computer scientists can certainly have these traits, they are more stereotypically associated with the humanities.

- He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, which also seem to align more with a humanities background. 

- Most tellingly, the description states he is "not particularly technical", which would be quite unusual for a tenured computer science professor.

Of course, it's impossible to say for certain based on this brief description alone. There are surely some computer science professors who fit this general profile. But if I had to guess, I'd say there's only a small 10% chance that Jason is one of the 75 computer science professors, and a much higher 90% chance he is one of the 25 humanities professors. The base rates (75% of the sample being CS professors) pull the probability up a bit, but the specific details in the description are much more consistent with a humanities background.
