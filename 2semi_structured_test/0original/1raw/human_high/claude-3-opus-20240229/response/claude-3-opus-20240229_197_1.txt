Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, suggests he is more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. However, there is still some possibility he could be a computer science professor, as the field can attract some imaginative and creative individuals. Without more specific information, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that Jason is a computer science professor from this sample.
