Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill for computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would assign a relatively low probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
