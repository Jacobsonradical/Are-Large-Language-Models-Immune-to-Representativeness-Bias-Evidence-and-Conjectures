Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be fairly low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
