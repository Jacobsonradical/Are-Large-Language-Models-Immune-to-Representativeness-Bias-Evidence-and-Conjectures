Based on the description provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description portrays him as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill and interest for computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being a computer science professor.
