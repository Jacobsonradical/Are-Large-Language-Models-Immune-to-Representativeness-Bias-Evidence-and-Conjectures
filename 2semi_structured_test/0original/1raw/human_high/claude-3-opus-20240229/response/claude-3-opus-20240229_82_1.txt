Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 0.75. However, the description of Jason strongly indicates he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.2"}
