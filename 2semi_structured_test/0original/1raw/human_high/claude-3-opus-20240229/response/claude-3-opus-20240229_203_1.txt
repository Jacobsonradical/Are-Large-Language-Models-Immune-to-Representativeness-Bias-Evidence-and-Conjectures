Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, the description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits seem more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science.

Since the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the details provided for Jason seem more consistent with a humanities background.

Weighing the base rate probability against the profile details, I'd estimate roughly a 30% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.
