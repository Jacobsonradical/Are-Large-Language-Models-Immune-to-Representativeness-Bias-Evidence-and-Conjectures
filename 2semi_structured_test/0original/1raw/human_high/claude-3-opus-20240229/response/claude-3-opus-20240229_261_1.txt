{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description, Jason appears to be more aligned with the personality traits typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about travel, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often found in computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and Jason's description seems more representative of the humanities group, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be around 0.25 (25%).
