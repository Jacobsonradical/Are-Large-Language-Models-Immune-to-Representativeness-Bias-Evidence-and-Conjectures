To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the key information provided in the description and relate it to the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Key points about Jason:
1. Creative and imaginative
2. Emotionally driven
3. Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
4. Gifted and passionate
5. Not particularly technical

The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Based on the description, Jason's traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor, particularly the notes about him being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical.

Given the base rates and Jason's description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor appears to be lower than the probability of him being a humanities professor.
