Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering the description of Jason's personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be quite low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
