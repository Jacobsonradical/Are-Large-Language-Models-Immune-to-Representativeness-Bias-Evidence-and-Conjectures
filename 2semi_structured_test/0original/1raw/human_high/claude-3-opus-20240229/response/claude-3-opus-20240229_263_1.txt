{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoys activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical." 

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, there is a higher probability that he belongs to the group of humanities professors. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.25 (or 25%).
