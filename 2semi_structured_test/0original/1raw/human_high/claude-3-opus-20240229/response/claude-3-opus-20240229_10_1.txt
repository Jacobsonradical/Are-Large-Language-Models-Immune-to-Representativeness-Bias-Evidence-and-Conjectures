Based on the limited information provided about Jason, he does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. However, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description suggests Jason lacks technical skills or inclinations, the probability of him being one of the computer science professors in the sample appears to be low.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.2"}

This means there is approximately a 20% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the description provided. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate based on limited information, and individual professors can deviate from stereotypical traits associated with their field.
