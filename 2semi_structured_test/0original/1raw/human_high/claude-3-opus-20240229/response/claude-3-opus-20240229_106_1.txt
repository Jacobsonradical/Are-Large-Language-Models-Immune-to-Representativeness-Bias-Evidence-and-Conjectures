Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors, if I had no individuating information, my baseline probability of him being a computer science professor would be 0.75. However, the details provided are more consistent with a humanities professor, so I believe the probability is considerably lower than the baseline.

{"probability": "0.3"}
