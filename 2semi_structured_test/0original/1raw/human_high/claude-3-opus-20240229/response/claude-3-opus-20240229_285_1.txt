Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative, and passionate, rather than being particularly technical, which would be more common traits for someone in the humanities.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
