Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more emotionally driven, creative, and passionate, rather than being particularly technical, which would likely be an important trait for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as quite low.
