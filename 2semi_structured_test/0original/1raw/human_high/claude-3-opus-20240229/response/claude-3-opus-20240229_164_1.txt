Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which is often a key trait and requirement for success in the field of computer science. Additionally, being "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are traits more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
