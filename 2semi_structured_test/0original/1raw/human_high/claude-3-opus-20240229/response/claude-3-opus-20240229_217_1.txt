Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The passage mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technically oriented.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits and interests align more closely with the humanities, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
