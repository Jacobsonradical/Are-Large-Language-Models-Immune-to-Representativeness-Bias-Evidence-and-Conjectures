Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical," which further suggests that he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering the traits mentioned in Jason's description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
