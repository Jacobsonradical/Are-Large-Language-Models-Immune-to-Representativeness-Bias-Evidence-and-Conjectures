Based on the description provided, it appears that Jason's personality traits and interests align more closely with those typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. As a creative, imaginative, and emotionally-driven individual who enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, Jason seems to fit the stereotypical profile of a humanities professor. The description also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which further suggests that he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

However, it is important to note that individual personality traits and interests can vary widely within any given field, and there may be successful computer science professors who share some of Jason's characteristics.

Considering the limited information provided and the fact that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}
