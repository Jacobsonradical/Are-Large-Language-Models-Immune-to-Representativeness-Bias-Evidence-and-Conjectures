Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have personality traits and interests that align more closely with a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which seems to make it less likely that he is a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the specific details about Jason strongly point away from him being in that field.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low, around 0.10 or 10%.
