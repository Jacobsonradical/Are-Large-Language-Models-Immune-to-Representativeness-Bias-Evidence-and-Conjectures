{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. His traits of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring align more with a humanities background. The description also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical" which makes it less likely he is a computer science professor.

Given there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, if I had to guess purely based on the base rates, there would be a 0.75 probability of Jason being a computer science professor. 

However, the description provides relevant information that shifts the probability away from the base rate towards him more likely being a humanities professor. So I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.25.
