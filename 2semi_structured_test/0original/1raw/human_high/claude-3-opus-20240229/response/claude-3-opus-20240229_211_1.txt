Based on the description provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors, such as being highly analytical, technical, and detail-oriented, Jason's profile does not seem to align well with these characteristics.

Additionally, since 75% of the sample consisted of computer science professors and 25% were humanities professors, the base rate alone would suggest a 25% chance of Jason being a humanities professor, even without additional information.

Therefore, considering the base rate and Jason's described traits, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}
