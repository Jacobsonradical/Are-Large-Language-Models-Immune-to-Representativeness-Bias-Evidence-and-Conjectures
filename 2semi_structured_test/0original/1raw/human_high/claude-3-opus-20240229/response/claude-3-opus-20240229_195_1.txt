Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical," which is a key skill for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described characteristics, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is quite low.
