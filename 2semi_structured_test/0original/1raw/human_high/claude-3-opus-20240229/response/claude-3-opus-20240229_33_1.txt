Given the details provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading and exploring suggests he may be more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often tend to be more technical and analytical in their interests and personality.

However, the description is brief and personality traits can vary significantly even within professions, so there is still a reasonable possibility Jason could be a computer science professor. I've estimated a 15% chance to account for this uncertainty while still favoring the humanities based on the details provided.
