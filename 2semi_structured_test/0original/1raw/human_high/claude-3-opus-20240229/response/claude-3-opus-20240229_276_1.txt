Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science.

Given that only 25% of the professors in the sample were from the humanities while 75% were from computer science, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details provided for Jason seem more consistent with a humanities background.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is lower than the base rate of 75%, but not extremely low since we should not rely too heavily on a short description to make definitive judgments.
