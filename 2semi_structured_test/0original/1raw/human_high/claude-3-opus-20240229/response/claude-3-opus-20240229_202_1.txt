Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. The key details that suggest this are:

1. He is described as creative, imaginative, and often emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science.

2. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring - interests that align more with a humanities background.

3. The description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is an important skill and interest for computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be fairly low, around 0.2 (or 20%).
