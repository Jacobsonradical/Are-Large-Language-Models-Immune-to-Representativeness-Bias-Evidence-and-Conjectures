Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science. Additionally, being "creative and imaginative" and "emotionally driven" are traits that, while not incompatible with computer science, are more commonly associated with the humanities.

Given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
