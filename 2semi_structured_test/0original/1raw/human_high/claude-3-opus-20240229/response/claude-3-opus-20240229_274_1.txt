Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science.

2. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, which are fairly general interests not specifically tied to either field. 

3. Most importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical." Technical skills and interests are critical for success in computer science.

Given that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the details in this specific description, especially the lack of technical inclination, lead me to estimate a significantly lower than base rate probability of 20% that Jason is a computer science professor.
