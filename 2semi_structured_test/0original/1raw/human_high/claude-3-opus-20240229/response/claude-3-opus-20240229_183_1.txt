Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and is gifted but not particularly technical. These traits seem more stereotypically aligned with professors in the humanities rather than computer science.

However, it's important to note that individual traits can vary widely and do not necessarily determine one's field. There can certainly be creative and less technical individuals in computer science. The small sample sizes (75 CS professors vs 25 humanities) also make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

Without more specific information directly related to Jason's field, a low probability estimate that he is a computer science professor seems reasonable, but this is a tentative assessment based on limited data and stereotypical assumptions that may not hold true.
