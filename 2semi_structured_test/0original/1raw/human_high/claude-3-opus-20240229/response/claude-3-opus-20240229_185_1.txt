Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits not typically associated with computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that 75% of the sample are computer science professors and 25% are humanities professors, and considering the description of Jason's personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.2"}
