Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about exploring and reading, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, without more specific information, a definitive determination is difficult. The prior odds of 3 to 1 computer science to humanities professors in the sample also needs to be considered. So while Jason's description suggests humanities, the 25% probability estimate takes into account the base rates in the sample as well as the uncertainty given the limited information.
