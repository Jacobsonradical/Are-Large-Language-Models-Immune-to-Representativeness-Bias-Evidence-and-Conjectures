Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about things like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states he is "not particularly technical." These traits seem more aligned with a humanities background than computer science, which tends to attract more technical and analytical thinkers.

Given that there were 25 humanities professors and 75 computer science professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor to be fairly low, perhaps around 0.2.
