Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}
