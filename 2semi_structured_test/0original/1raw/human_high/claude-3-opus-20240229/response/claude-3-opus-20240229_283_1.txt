{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits are often associated more with humanities fields than technical fields like computer science.

Additionally, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical," which further suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be around 0.25 (25%).
