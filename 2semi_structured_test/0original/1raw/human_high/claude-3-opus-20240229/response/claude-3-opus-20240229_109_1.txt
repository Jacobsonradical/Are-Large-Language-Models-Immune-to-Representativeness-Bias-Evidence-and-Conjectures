Based on the limited information provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits not typically associated with the technical and analytical nature of computer science. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that Jason is "not particularly technical."

Given that 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors, if no other information was available, the base rate probability would be 0.75. However, the description of Jason strongly suggests he is more likely to be part of the humanities group.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low:

{"probability": "0.1"}
