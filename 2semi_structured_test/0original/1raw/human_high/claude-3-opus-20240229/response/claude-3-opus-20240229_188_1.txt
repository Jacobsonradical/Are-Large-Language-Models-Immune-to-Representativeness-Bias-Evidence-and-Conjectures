Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits that are more typically associated with the humanities than with technical fields like computer science. The description also explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical".

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and without any other information to go on besides the description, I would estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.10 to 0.20.

{"probability": "0.15"}
