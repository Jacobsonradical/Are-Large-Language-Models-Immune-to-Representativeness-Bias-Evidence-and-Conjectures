Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about subjects like travel, reading and exploring. However it also notes he is not particularly technical.

Given that 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, which tends to attract more technical personalities, and only 25% are in the humanities, the description of Jason seems more aligned with a typical humanities professor than a computer science professor. 

However, there is certainly a possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor who is an exception to the typical traits. So I wouldn't put the probability at 0, but rather as a relatively low 15% chance based on the limited information provided.
