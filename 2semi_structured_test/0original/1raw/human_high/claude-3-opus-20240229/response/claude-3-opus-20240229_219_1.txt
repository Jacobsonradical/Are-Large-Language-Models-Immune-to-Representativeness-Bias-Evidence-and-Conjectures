{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional nature, as well as his passion for travel, reading, and exploration. Importantly, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

While it's certainly possible for a computer science professor to have these traits, they are more stereotypically associated with professors in the humanities. The lack of technical inclination especially seems to point away from computer science.

Given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking any other information to go on besides the description, I would estimate a relatively low probability of around 0.1 that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
