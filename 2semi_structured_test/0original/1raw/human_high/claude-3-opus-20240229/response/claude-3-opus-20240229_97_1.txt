To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Key points:
1. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring.
3. Importantly, Jason is described as "not particularly technical."

Given that the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 75%, without any additional information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor would be 0.75.

However, the description suggests that Jason's traits and interests align more closely with those typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, particularly the note about him not being "particularly technical."

While we should be cautious about relying too heavily on stereotypes, the information provided suggests that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Considering the base rate and the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be lower than the base rate of 0.75, but not extremely low, as there is still a chance that a computer science professor could have these traits.
