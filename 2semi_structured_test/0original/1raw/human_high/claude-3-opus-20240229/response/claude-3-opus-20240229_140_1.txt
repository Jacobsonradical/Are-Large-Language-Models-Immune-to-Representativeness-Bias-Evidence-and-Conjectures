{"probability": "0.10"}

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about things like traveling, reading, and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is not particularly technical.

These traits seem more aligned with a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. Computer science professors often tend to be more technical and analytical in their thinking and interests.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate there is only about a 10% chance (0.10 probability) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
