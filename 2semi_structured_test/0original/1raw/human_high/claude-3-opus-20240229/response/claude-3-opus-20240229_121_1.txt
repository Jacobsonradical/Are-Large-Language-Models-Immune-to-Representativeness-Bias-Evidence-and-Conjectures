Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, traits that are often more associated with humanities fields. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key skill for computer science.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the details in Jason's description strongly point away from him being in computer science.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low:

{"probability": "0.15"}
