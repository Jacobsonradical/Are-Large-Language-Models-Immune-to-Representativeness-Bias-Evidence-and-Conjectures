Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, the passage explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical".

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as quite low.

{"probability": "0.1"}
