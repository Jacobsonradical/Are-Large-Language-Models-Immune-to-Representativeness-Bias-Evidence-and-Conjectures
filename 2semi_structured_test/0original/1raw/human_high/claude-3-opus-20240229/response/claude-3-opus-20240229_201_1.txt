Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while being "not particularly technical", seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technical in their interests and skills.

However, individual traits and interests can vary, and the sample sizes of the two groups are quite different (75 computer science professors vs 25 humanities professors). Without more specific information, I'd estimate Jason has approximately a 1 in 4 chance of being one of the computer science professors in the sample.
