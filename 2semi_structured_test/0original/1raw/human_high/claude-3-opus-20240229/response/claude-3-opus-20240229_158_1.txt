Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are often more associated with individuals in the humanities or arts rather than in technical fields like computer science.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering the description of Jason's personality, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be relatively low.
