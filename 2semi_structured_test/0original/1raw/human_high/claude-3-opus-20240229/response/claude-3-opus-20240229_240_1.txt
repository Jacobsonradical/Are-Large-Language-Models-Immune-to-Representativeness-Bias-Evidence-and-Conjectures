Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. A few key points:

- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, traits more commonly associated with humanities than computer science. 
- He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring - again activities that might be more typical of a humanities scholar.
- Crucially, the description states Jason is "not particularly technical" which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given there are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any random individual being a CS professor is 75%. However, the details provided for Jason seem much more consistent with the profile of a humanities professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be fairly low, perhaps around 20%:
