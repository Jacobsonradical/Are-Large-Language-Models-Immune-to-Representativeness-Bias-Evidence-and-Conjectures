{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that align more closely with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate that there is approximately a 25% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
