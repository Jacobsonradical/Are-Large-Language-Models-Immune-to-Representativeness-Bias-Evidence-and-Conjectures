Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while being "not particularly technical", suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science professors often have strong technical skills and interests.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, there is still a reasonable chance Jason could be a computer science professor who happens to have those traits, even if they are more stereotypically associated with humanities. So I estimate a 20% probability he is a computer science professor, with the remaining 80% probability that he is one of the humanities professors in the sample.
