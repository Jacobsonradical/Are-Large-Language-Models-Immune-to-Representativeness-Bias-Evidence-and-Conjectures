Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. Importantly, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the specific details in Jason's description are more consistent with a humanities professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the base rate of 75%, but not extremely low, as the description is brief and there can certainly be some variance in traits among professors even within the same field.
