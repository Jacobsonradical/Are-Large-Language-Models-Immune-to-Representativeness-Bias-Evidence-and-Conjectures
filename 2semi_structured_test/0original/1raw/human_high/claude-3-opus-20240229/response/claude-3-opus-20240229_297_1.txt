Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Computer science professors are more likely to be technically inclined, while Jason is described as "not particularly technical" and more "emotionally driven". His interests in traveling, reading and exploring also seem more typical of a humanities professor.

Considering there are 25 humanities professors and 75 computer science professors in the sample, and lacking other information, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at around 0.2.
