Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. While computer science professors can certainly have these qualities, the field generally requires strong technical skills and a more analytical mindset.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low.

{"probability": "0.2"}
