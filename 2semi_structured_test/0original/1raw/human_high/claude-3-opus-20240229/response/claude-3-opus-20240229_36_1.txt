{"probability": "0.25"}

Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have personality traits and interests more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about areas like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description also notes that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he may be less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 0.75. However, the specific details provided about Jason seem more consistent with the stereotype of a humanities professor. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be lower than the prior probability, around 0.25.
