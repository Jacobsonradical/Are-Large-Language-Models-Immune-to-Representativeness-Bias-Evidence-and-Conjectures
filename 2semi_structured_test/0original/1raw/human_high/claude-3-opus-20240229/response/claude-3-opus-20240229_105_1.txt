Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more typical of someone in the humanities rather than computer science. The prior probability of him being a computer science professor is 0.75 based on the study's sample (75 out of 100 professors were in CS). However, the specific personality traits mentioned are more consistent with a humanities background, so I've estimated a significantly lower probability than the prior.
