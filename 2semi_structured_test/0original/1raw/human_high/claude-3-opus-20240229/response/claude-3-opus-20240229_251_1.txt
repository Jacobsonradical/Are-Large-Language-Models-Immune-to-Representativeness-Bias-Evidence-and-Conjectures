Based on the description provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science, which tends to attract more analytical and technical individuals.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is relatively low.
