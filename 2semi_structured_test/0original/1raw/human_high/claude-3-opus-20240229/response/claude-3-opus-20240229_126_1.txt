Based on the given description, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven nature, as well as his enjoyment of traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also mentions that he is "not particularly technical," which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills often associated with computer science professors.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be relatively low, around 0.2 (or 20%).
