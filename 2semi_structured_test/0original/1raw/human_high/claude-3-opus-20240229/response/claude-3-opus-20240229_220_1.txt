Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Computer science professors often tend to be more analytical and technically inclined.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's description seems more aligned with a humanities background, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as:

{"probability": "0.2"}
