From the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." These traits align more closely with stereotypical attributes of humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

Additionally, the base rates in the sample are important to consider - there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So without any other information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, the specific details in the description are more salient and point away from computer science. Weighing the base rates against the description, I'd estimate roughly a 1 in 3 chance that Jason is a computer science professor.
