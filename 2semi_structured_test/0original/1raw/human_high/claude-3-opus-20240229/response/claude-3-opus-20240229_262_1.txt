Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits are more typically associated with humanities fields than with technical fields like computer science.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering the description of Jason's personality, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.2"}
