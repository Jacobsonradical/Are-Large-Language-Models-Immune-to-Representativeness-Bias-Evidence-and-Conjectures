Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Additionally, the mention that he is "not particularly technical" further reduces the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, as it's certainly possible for a computer science professor to have the traits described. The sample also contained 3 times as many computer science professors as humanities professors, which slightly increases the base rate probability that a randomly selected individual would be a computer science professor.
