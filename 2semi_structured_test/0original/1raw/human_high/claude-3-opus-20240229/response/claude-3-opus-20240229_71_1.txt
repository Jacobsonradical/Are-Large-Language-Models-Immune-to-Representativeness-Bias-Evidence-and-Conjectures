Based on the given description, here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, suggests he is more likely to be one of the humanities professors rather than the computer science professors. Computer science professors are more likely to be technically inclined.

However, there is still some possibility Jason is a computer science professor, as the field can attract some creative and imaginative individuals, even if they are a minority. Therefore, I estimate a relatively low 15% probability that Jason is a computer science professor, with an 85% probability he is one of the humanities professors.
