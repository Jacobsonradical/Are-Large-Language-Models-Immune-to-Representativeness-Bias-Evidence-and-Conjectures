From the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Additionally, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 0.75. However, the description of Jason strongly suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
