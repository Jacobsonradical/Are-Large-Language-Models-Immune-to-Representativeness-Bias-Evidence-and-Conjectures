Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about activities like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description also states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that there are 25 humanities professors and 75 computer science professors in the total sample of 100, and lacking any other information to distinguish the groups, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. 

However, the details in Jason's description point away from him being a computer science professor. Considering these aspects, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be significantly lower than the base rate.
