From the description, Jason seems to have traits and interests more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven and passionate - traits that may be valuable in any field, but are not as commonly associated with computer science. His hobbies of traveling, reading and exploring also seem more typical of humanities than CS. Most tellingly, he is described as "not particularly technical", while technical ability is critical for computer science.

Given the study sampled 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had no individuating information, the base rate probability of a random professor being from CS would be 75%. However, the details provided about Jason are more consistent with the stereotype of a humanities professor.

Weighing the base rates with the individuating information, I would estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.25"}
