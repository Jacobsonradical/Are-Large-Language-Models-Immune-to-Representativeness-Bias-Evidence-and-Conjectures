{"probability": "0.1"}

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. A few key points:

1. Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven". These traits are more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science.

2. His interests of "traveling, reading, and exploring" also seem more aligned with a humanities background. 

3. Most tellingly, the description explicitly states Jason is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." Technical skills are essentially a requirement for computer science professors.

4. The study sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So all else being equal, there's a 75% chance of any randomly selected professor being from computer science. 

However, given the strong evidence that Jason's personality and skills are more humanities-oriented, I estimate only about a 10% probability that he is actually one of the computer science professors in the sample, despite computer science professors making up 75% of the total.
