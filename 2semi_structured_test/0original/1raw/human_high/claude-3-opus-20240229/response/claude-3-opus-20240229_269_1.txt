Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that are more typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. However, the specific details about Jason strongly point away from him being a computer science professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be quite low, around 0.1 or 10%.
