Based on the description provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.15"}

The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, with a passion for traveling, reading and exploring. It also notes he is gifted but not particularly technical.

Given that the study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and that computer science tends to require more technical skills and less emphasis on emotional and creative traits compared to the humanities, I believe there is a lower probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
