Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, based on the description, he seems to fit the stereotype of a humanities professor more than a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, emotional nature, and passion for travel, reading and exploring. It also specifically notes he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

That said, individuals can certainly break stereotypes, and there is significant variability within both fields. Without more data on the actual ratio of these traits between the two professor groups sampled, I'll refrain from giving a probability too close to 0 or 1.

My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.3"}

That is, based solely on the description provided, I believe there is approximately a 30% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, and a 70% chance he is one of the humanities professors. But again, this estimate comes with a good deal of uncertainty.
