Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical traits one might associate with a computer science professor. The description emphasizes his creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, as well as his enjoyment of activities like traveling, reading, and exploring. Importantly, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that only 25 out of the 100 professors in the study were from the humanities, and considering the description of Jason as not being technical, I would assign a relatively low probability to him being one of the computer science professors.
