{"probability": "0.15"}

From the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 0, because there is still some possibility that Jason could be a computer science professor. Creativity and imagination are valuable traits in computer science as well, especially in certain subfields. And being "not particularly technical" does not necessarily preclude one from being a successful computer science academic.

Given the small sample size of humanities professors (25) compared to computer science professors (75), I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.15 or 15%.
