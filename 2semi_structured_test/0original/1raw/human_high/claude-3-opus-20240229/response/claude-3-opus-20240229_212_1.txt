Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with typical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, individual traits can vary, and without more specific information it's difficult to assign a probability with high confidence. So I've estimated a 25% chance that Jason is a computer science professor, with the caveat that this probability is highly uncertain based on the limited data provided.
