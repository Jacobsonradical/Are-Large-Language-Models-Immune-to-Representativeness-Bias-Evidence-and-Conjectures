Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to make a highly confident assessment. However, based on the description, Jason seems to have traits more typically associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits often linked with the humanities. Importantly, the description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical", which seems at odds with being a computer science professor.

The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75%, given that 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science. However, the specific details provided about Jason suggest a lower probability in this case.

Weighing the base rate of 75% against the description that seems more aligned with a humanities professor, I estimate the probability to be around 30% that Jason is a computer science professor.
