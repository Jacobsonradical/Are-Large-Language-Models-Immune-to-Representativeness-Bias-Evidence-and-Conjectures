Based on the description provided, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits often associated with the humanities. It also states that he is not particularly technical, which suggests he may not have the strong technical skills typically required for computer science.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's described traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.2"}
