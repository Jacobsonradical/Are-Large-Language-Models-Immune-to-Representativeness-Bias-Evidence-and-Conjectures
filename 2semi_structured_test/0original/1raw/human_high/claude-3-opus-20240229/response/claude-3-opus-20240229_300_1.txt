Given the limited information provided about Jason and the study sample composition, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.25"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with stereotypical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, individual traits can vary widely and stereotypes are not always accurate. 

Since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess based on the description alone, I would lean towards guessing Jason is more likely one of the 25 humanities professors in the sample. This would correspond to a 25% probability (25 / 100 = 0.25) of him being a computer science professor.
