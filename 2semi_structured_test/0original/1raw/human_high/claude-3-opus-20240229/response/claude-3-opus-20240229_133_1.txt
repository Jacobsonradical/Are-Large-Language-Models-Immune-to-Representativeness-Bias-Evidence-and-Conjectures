Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a highly confident assessment. However, based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a humanities professor than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoying activities like traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, it's also mentioned that he is "not particularly technical", which seems less typical for a computer science professor.

That said, individual traits can vary a lot, and without more detailed information it's hard to give a precise probability estimate. As a rough guess though, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.3"}

In other words, I believe there's roughly a 30% chance Jason is a computer science professor, and a 70% chance he is a humanities professor. But this estimate has a fair amount of uncertainty given the limited data provided in the description.
