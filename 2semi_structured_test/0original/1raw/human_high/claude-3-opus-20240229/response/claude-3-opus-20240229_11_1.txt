Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which are traits more commonly associated with humanities fields.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and considering Jason's description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 0.2.
