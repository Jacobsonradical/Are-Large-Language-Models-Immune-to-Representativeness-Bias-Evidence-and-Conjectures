Based on the limited information provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more stereotypically associated with the humanities than computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which would be unusual for a computer science professor.

Given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and lacking any strong evidence that Jason is a computer scientist, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 25%, in line with the base rate of humanities professors in the sample.
