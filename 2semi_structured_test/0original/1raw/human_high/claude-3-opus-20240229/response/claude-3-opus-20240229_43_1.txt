From the description, Jason seems to have traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. His creativity, imagination, passion for reading and exploring, and being driven more by emotion than technical skills all point to a personality that may be better suited for the humanities.

Given that the study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the specific details provided about Jason lower this probability.

Without more data on the exact distribution of traits among the two groups, I'll make a conservative estimate that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is only about 20%.
