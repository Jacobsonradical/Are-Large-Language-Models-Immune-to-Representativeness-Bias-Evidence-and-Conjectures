Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that align more closely with a typical humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring - traits and interests more commonly associated with the humanities. Importantly, the description explicitly states that Jason is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait for computer science professors.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%. However, the description of Jason strongly suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, despite the base rates favoring computer science, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be quite low, around 20%:

{"probability": "0.20"}
