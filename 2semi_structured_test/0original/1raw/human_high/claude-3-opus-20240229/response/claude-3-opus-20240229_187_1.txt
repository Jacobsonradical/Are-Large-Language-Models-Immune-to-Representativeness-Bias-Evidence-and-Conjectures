Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description suggests he is more creatively and emotionally oriented, enjoys activities like traveling and reading, and is "not particularly technical". Computer science professors tend to be more analytical and technically skilled.

Given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess purely based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.2"}

That is, without additional information, I believe there is only about a 20% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, and a higher likelihood that he is one of the humanities professors. However, this is a very rough estimate based on stereotypes and the limited data in the description.
