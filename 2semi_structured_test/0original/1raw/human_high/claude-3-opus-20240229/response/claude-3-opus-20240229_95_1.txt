Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the description, Jason seems to have traits more typically associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. His creativity, imagination, passion for travel, reading and exploring, along with being described as "not particularly technical", suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Without more data on the distribution of these traits among both groups, I'll make a rough estimate that the probability Jason is a computer science professor is around 0.2, or 20%.
