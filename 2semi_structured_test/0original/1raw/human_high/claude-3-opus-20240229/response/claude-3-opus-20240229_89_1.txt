The description of Jason suggests he is more likely to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Some key indicators are:

- He is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science. 
- He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring which also point more towards humanities interests.
- Most tellingly, it explicitly states he is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." Technical aptitude and focus is a defining characteristic of computer science.

Given there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. However, the specific details for Jason strongly point away from computer science and towards the humanities.

Weighing the base rates with the individuating information, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is fairly low, around 15%.
