Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}

The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring, while not being particularly technical, seems more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Computer science often requires strong technical skills.

However, the sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So despite the description seeming to fit a humanities professor better, there's still a reasonable chance Jason could be one of the computer science professors, given their much larger representation in the sample.
