Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description mentions that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about topics like traveling, reading and exploring, which are more typically associated with humanities fields. Importantly, it also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which is a key trait for computer science.

Given that only 25% of the sample were humanities professors, if I had to guess solely from this description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at around 0.2 or 20%.

{"probability": "0.2"}
