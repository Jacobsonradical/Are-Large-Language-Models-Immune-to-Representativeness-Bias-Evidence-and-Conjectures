Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and enjoys activities like traveling, reading and exploring. It also explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical." 

Given that computer science is a highly technical field, and the description of Jason doesn't highlight any technical skills or inclinations, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as fairly low, perhaps around 0.2 or 20%.

{"probability": "0.2"}
