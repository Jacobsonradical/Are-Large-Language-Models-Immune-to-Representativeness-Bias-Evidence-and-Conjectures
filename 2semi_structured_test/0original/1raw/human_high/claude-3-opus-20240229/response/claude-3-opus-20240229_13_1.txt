Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits and interests more commonly associated with professors in the humanities rather than computer science. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate about traveling, reading and exploring. Importantly, the description explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical", which suggests he is less likely to be a computer science professor.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. However, the description of Jason strongly implies he is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Therefore, I estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be quite low, around 0.10 or 10%.

{"probability": "0.10"}
