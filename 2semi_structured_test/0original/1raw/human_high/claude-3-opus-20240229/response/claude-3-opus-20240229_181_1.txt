Based on the description provided, Jason does not seem to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. The description mentions that he is "not particularly technical", while being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven. These traits are more commonly associated with individuals in the humanities field.

Given that the study sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and considering Jason's described personality traits, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors as follows:

{"probability": "0.2"}
