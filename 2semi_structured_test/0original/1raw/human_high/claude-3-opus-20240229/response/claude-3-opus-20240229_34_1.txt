Based on the description provided, it seems less likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits more commonly associated with the humanities than computer science. Additionally, it's explicitly stated that he is "not particularly technical", which further reduces the likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Given that 75% of the sample are computer science professors, the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor (without considering any other information) would be 0.75. However, the details in his description point more towards him being one of the humanities professors.

Considering all these factors, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.2"}
