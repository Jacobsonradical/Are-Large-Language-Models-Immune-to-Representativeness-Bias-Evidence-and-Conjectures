Based on the description provided, it seems unlikely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. The description suggests he is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which are traits not typically associated with computer science. Additionally, it explicitly states that he is "not particularly technical."

Given that 75% of the sample are computer science professors, if I had no individuating information, my base rate probability estimate would be 0.75 that Jason is a computer science professor. However, the description provides relevant evidence that shifts my estimate significantly lower.
