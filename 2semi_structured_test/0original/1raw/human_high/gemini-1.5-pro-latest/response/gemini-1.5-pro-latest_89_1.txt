{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25% chance that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities. 

The description of Jason doesn't offer strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be in computer science or humanities. While some might associate "technical" with computer science, many fields require technical skills, and the description implies Jason's strengths lie elsewhere.  

Without strong indicators, the prior probability (25% chance of being in humanities) remains the most reasonable estimate.
