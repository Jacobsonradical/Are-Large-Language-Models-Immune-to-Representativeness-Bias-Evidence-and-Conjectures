**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would definitively indicate whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Since the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a 75/100 chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.  

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate within the sample: 75/100 = 0.75. However, since we are asked about Jason specifically, and his description doesn't offer any clues, the probability should be adjusted to reflect the overall distribution of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.25 (25 humanities professors out of 100 total).
