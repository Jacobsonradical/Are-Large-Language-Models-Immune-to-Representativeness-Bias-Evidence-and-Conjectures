{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

However, the description of Jason doesn't strongly suggest a specific field. While traits like "creative and imaginative" might be slightly more associated with humanities, they are not exclusive to it. Many computer scientists, especially in areas like AI or human-computer interaction, possess these traits.  

The phrase "though not particularly technical" *slightly* decreases the likelihood of Jason being in computer science. However, it doesn't definitively rule it out.  He could still be a computer scientist in a less technical subfield or someone who excels more in theoretical aspects than hands-on coding.

**Therefore, while the probability is slightly lower than the baseline 0.75, it is not drastically different. A probability of 0.25 is too low, indicating a strong bias against him being in computer science based on weak evidence.**
