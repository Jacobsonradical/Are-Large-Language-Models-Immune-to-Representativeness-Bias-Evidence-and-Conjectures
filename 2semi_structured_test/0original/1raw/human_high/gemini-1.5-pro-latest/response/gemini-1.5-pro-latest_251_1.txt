{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, a randomly selected professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities.  

The description of Jason doesn't strongly suggest he is in computer science or humanities. While he is described as "not particularly technical," this doesn't definitively place him in either field.  Many humanities disciplines can be quite technical, and there are areas within computer science that are less focused on traditional technical skills. 

**Therefore, without stronger evidence, the prior probability based on the sample composition (25%) is the most appropriate estimate.**
