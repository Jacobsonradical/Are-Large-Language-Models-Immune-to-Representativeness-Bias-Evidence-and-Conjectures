{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field.  Here's why I chose 0.25 (which represents the base probability given no additional information):

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. This means there's a base 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Description Ambiguity:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, and emotional drive. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **Lack of Technical Emphasis:** The statement "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is weak evidence, as many successful computer scientists excel in areas beyond pure technical skills (e.g., leadership, communication).

**Without stronger indicators related to Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests, it's best to stick close to the base probability of him being a computer science professor, which is 0.75 or 75%. However, since the question asks for the probability of him being one of the computer science professors in the *sample*, and the sample contains only 100 professors, the probability needs to be adjusted to reflect the sample proportion, resulting in a probability of 0.25 (25%).**
