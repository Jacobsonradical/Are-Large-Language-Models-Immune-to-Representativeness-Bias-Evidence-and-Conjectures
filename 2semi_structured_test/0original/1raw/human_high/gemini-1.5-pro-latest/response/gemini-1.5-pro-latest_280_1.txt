{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information directly relevant to his field of study. 

Here's why a lower probability leaning towards humanities is more likely:

* **Stereotypes:** We often associate computer science with technical skills, which Jason is described as not particularly possessing. Humanities fields are often perceived as more aligned with creativity and emotional expression.
* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science. However, the description pushes against this base rate.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid relying heavily on stereotypes.  While the description might nudge us towards humanities, it's entirely possible for someone with Jason's traits to be a successful computer science professor. A larger, more detailed description would be needed to make a stronger prediction.
