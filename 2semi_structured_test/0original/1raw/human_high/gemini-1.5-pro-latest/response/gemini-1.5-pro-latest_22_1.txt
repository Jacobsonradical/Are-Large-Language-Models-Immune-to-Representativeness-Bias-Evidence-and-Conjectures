{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there is no information directly linking him to either computer science or the humanities. 

The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  Therefore, there is a 25% chance (25/100) that Jason is one of the humanities professors.  

Since the description doesn't offer any clues to sway us strongly in either direction, the prior probability based purely on the sample composition is the most logical estimate.
