{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor. Since 25% of the professors in the study were from the humanities (25 out of 100), the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the remaining 75%, or 0.75.
