{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why a lower probability leaning towards humanities is more likely:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not be inclined towards a field like computer science, which requires strong technical skills.
* **"Creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys...reading and exploring"**: These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, are often associated with fields like literature, philosophy, history, etc.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are many creative and emotionally driven individuals in computer science, and the description doesn't rule out that possibility for Jason. 

The low probability of 0.25 reflects the uncertainty and the slight leaning towards humanities based on the provided description.
