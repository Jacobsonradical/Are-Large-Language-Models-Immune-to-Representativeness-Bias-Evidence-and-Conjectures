{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's personality traits being more common among computer science or humanities professors, the base rate is the most important factor. 

* There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
* This means 75% of the professors in the study were from computer science.

Without any further information suggesting Jason is more likely to be in one field or the other, there's a 25% chance he's one of the 25 humanities professors and a 75% chance he's one of the 75 computer science professors.
