{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Personality traits:** The description highlights Jason's creativity, imagination, and emotional drive. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **Hobbies:**  Enjoying travel, reading, and exploring are common interests and don't strongly suggest a particular academic field.
* **"Not particularly technical"**: This statement could suggest Jason is less likely to be in computer science, but it's not definitive. Humanities professors can also be quite technical in their areas of expertise (e.g., digital humanities).

**Since the description doesn't offer strong evidence in either direction, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 75% (or 0.75) chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.

**However**, the question asks for the probability **given the description**. Since the description leans slightly away from computer science, we should adjust our probability slightly downward. A probability of **0.25** acknowledges the slight evidence against computer science while recognizing the limited information available.
