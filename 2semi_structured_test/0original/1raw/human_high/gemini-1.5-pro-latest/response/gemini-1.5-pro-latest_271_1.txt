**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information in the description that clearly suggests whether Jason is in computer science or humanities, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **75 out of 100** professors are in computer science.
* **25 out of 100** professors are in humanities.

Therefore, without any further information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is **0.75**. 

However, the question asks for the probability of Jason being **one of the computer science professors in the sample**. Since the sample itself is small (75 computer science professors), and we are talking about a single, specific professor within that sample, the probability wouldn't be as high as 0.75. 

While we cannot calculate the exact probability without more information, a reasonable estimate considering the small sample size would be lower than the base rate. A value like **0.25** reflects both the base rate and the fact that we are looking at a single individual within a limited sample.
