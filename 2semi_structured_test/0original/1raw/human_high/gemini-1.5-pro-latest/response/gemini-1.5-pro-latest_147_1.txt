{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it offers little to strongly suggest he's a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some general stereotypes about humanities versus STEM fields (creative and passionate vs. technical). However, these are broad generalizations and not reliable indicators.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if such stereotypes held some weight, the small sample size of the study (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors) makes it more likely that Jason belongs to the larger group, simply by chance.

**It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes.** There are plenty of creative and passionate computer scientists, just as there are very technical individuals in the humanities. 

**The lack of explicitly "technical" traits in the description makes it slightly more probable that Jason might belong to the humanities group, but the difference is not substantial enough to deviate significantly from the base probability determined by the sample sizes.**
