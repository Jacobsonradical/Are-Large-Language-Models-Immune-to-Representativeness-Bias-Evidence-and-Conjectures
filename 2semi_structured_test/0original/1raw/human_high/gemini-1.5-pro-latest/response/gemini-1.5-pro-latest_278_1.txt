{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong clues about his profession. Here's why:

* **Personality traits:** Traits like "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," "gifted," and "passionate" can be found in both computer science and humanities professors. 
* **Hobbies:**  Enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring are also common interests across different fields.
* **Technical ability:**  The statement "not particularly technical" might suggest he's less likely to be in computer science. However, it's not definitive. There are areas within computer science where technical expertise isn't the sole focus.

**Since the description is not informative, we fall back to the base rate provided in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science. 
* This means there's a 75% (or 0.75) chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.

However, the prompt asks about the probability given that Jason is "not particularly technical".  While this doesn't exclude him from being a computer science professor, it does make it somewhat less likely. Therefore, a probability lower than 0.75 is warranted.  

**Without more information, a probability of 0.25 (representing a significant decrease from the base rate due to the "not particularly technical" statement) seems like a reasonable estimate.**
