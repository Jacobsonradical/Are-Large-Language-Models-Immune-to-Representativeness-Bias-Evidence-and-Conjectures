{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming computer scientists are less creative or emotionally driven is a harmful stereotype. Many successful computer scientists are deeply creative and passionate individuals. 
* **Description is vague:**  The terms "gifted" and "not particularly technical" are relative.  We lack context to understand his skill level in either field.

**Since the description is relatively neutral and the base rate of computer science professors in the study is 75/100 (0.75), a probability closer to the base rate, but slightly lower to account for the slightly less "technical" description, is warranted.**
