**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Personality Traits:**  The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a passion for travel, reading, and exploration.  These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **"Not Particularly Technical":** This phrase might suggest a bias against computer science. However, it's not definitive. Many humanities fields require technical skills, and even within computer science, there are roles that emphasize creativity and big-picture thinking over deep technical expertise.

**Base Rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.  This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science.

**Conclusion:** Due to the lack of strong indicators and the higher base rate for computer science professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is slightly lower than the base rate, but not significantly so.
