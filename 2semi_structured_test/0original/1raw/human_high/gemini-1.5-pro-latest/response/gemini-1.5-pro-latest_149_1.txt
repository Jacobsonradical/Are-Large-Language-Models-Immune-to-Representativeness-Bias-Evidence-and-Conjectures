{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. However, these are stereotypes and not accurate for many individuals.
* **Humanities can be technical:**  Fields within the humanities, like digital humanities or computational linguistics, often require technical skills.

**Given the lack of strong evidence, the probability should be based on the sample proportions:**

* **75/100** professors are in computer science.
* **25/100** professors are in the humanities.

Therefore, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is **0.75**, and the prior probability of him being in the humanities is **0.25**. Without further information, we should rely on the base rates provided by the sample.
