{"probability": "0.2"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why I lean slightly towards him being in the humanities (80% probability):

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests that technical skills may not be his strong suit, which is more atypical for computer science professors. 
* **"Creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys...reading, and exploring"**: These traits are often associated with humanities fields, though they can certainly be present in individuals from any discipline.

**Important Note:** This is a very weak prediction. The provided description is simply too general to make a confident judgment. Many computer science professors are creative, imaginative, and well-read.  A larger emphasis on logical thinking, problem-solving skills, or a passion for technology would have significantly increased the probability of him being in computer science.
