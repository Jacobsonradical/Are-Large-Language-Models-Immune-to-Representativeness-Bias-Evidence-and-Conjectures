{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. 

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "not particularly technical" might seem to point away from computer science. However, these are broad generalizations and don't accurately represent the diversity within the field.
* **Base Rate is crucial:** The most important factor is the base rate in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, or a 75% chance that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

**Since we lack strong evidence to shift from the base rate, a probability of 0.25 (which is the base rate probability of being a humanities professor) is a reasonable starting point.**
