**Reasoning:**

The description emphasizes Jason's creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and enjoyment of reading and exploring. These traits are often associated with humanities disciplines. While a computer science professor *could* possess these traits, they are perhaps less stereotypical for the field, especially the emphasis on being "not particularly technical". 

It's important to note that this is a probabilistic judgment, and we cannot definitively say for sure. There is still a chance Jason is in computer science, but the description leans towards him being in the humanities.
