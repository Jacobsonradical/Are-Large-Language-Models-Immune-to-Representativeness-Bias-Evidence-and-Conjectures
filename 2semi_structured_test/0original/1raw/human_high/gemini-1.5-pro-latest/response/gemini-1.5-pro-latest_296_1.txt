{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study (computer science or humanities). 

Here's why I chose a probability of 0.25:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. This means there's a 75% (0.75) chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science and a 25% (0.25) chance they are in the humanities.
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description doesn't strongly suggest either field.  Being "creative and imaginative" or "not particularly technical" are traits that can be found in both computer science and humanities professors.
* **Avoiding Bias:**  It's important to avoid stereotypes. Assuming humanities professors are more likely to be "creative and imaginative" or that computer science professors can't be "emotionally driven" would be biased and inaccurate.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.25.**
