{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** We might assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative compared to humanities professors. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable for individual assessment. 
* **Description is general:**  The description could fit many professions that value creativity, passion, and exploration. 
* **Base rate is important:** The most important factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science (75%) and 25 are in humanities (25%). This means there's a higher starting probability that Jason is a computer science professor simply because there are more of them in the sample.

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to override the base rate, a probability close to the base rate of 0.75 for computer science is not justified. However, it's also unlikely that the description completely negates the base rate.**

**Therefore, a probability of 0.25, reflecting a lower likelihood than the base rate but not entirely dismissing it, seems like a reasonable estimate.**
