{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it offers little to indicate his profession. Here's why:

* **Personality Traits:**  The description highlights traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a passion for travel, reading, and exploration.  These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities.  
* **Lack of "Technical" Descriptor:**  The statement "though not particularly technical" might seem like it points away from computer science. However,  "technical" can be interpreted in many ways, and even within computer science, there are roles that emphasize creativity and big-picture thinking over deep technical expertise.

**The Importance of Base Rate:**

Since we have no strong indicators from the description, we must rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.75 or 75%.  However, the prompt asks for the probability that he is one of the *computer science professors in the sample*, which is 75/100 = 0.25. **
