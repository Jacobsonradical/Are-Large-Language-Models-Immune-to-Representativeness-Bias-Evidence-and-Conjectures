{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into whether he would be more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** The description touches upon traits often associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading), but these are not exclusive to the humanities field. Many computer scientists are also creative and well-read.
* **Small sample size:**  The study has a relatively small sample size, especially for the humanities group (25).  

Since the description lacks strong indicators either way, the best approach is to rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities (25%) 

Without further information, there's a higher probability that Jason belongs to the larger group, the computer science professors. Therefore, the probability is **0.25** (equivalent to 25%).
