{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean slightly towards him being in humanities (and thus a 0.3 probability of being in computer science):

* **"Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"**: These traits, while present in both fields, are often more strongly associated with humanities disciplines.
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**:  The "not particularly technical" comment leans against a computer science stereotype. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's crucial to avoid simply slotting people into fields based on general impressions. Many computer scientists are creative and passionate, and many humanities scholars are highly technical.
* **Limited Information:** The description offers a very limited snapshot of Jason's personality.  More information about his research interests, work style, and specific skills would be needed for a more confident assessment.
