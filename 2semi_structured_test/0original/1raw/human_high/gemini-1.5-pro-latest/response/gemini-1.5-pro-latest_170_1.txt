{"probability": "0.1"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Creative and imaginative:** Applicable to both fields. Computer science requires creative problem-solving, while humanities thrive on imagination.
* **Emotionally driven:**  Could apply to both, perhaps leaning slightly more towards humanities depending on the field (e.g., literature, philosophy).
* **Enjoys traveling, reading, exploring:**  Common interests not exclusive to either field. 
* **Gifted and passionate:** Again, applicable to both.
* **Not particularly technical:** This leans slightly towards humanities, but many areas within computer science (like HCI or design) are less technically focused.

**The Key:**

The description lacks any strong indicators specific to computer science (like a love for coding, logic puzzles, etc.).  

**Why 0.1?**

With the information given, and a slightly higher chance of the description fitting a humanities professor, the probability is a bit lower than random chance (which would be 0.75 for computer science based purely on the sample size). I've chosen 0.1 to reflect this, but it's an educated guess within a range of possibilities.
