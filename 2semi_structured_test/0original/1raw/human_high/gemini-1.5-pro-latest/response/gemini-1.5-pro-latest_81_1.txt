{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" are often associated with humanities, but they can be found in computer science as well. Many areas within computer science, like AI or human-computer interaction, require significant creativity. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only included 100 professors, with a 3:1 ratio favoring computer science. This means even if Jason's description perfectly matched a stereotypical "humanities" personality, there's still a 25% chance he's in computer science simply due to the study's makeup.

**Without stronger indicators related to his work style, technical skills, or research interests, the base probability of him being in either field is dictated by the study's sample proportions.**
