{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study. 

* **Lack of "stereotypical" indicators:** The description avoids typical stereotypes associated with computer science (e.g., highly technical, logical). However, the absence of these traits doesn't definitively rule out computer science.
* **Base Rate is Crucial:**  The most important factor is the base rate provided in the study:
    * 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
    * 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities. 

Since we have no strong evidence from the description to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other, we should rely on the base rate.  Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is **0.75 (75/100)**, which is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.
