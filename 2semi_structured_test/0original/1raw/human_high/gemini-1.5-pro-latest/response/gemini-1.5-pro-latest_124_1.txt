{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

The description of Jason provides no strong indicators of his profession. While some might stereotype computer science professors as less emotionally driven or less interested in the humanities, these are harmful generalizations.  

Since the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any individual being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.  

**Without any strong indicators from the description, the probability remains at the baseline of the sample distribution.**
