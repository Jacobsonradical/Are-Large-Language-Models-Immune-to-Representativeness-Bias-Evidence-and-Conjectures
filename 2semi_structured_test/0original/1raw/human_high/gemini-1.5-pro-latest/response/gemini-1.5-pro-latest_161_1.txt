{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it offers little to no direct indicators of his profession being computer science. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming all computer science professors are highly technical and lacking in emotional depth is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Humanities professors can be technical:**  Fields like digital humanities require strong technical skills. 
* **Personality is not a reliable predictor:**  While some personality traits might be slightly more common in one profession versus another, they are not definitive indicators. 

Since we have no strong signals towards computer science, we fall back on the base rate given in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This represents a 75% probability, or **0.75**.

However, the question asks for the probability of Jason being a computer science professor **given the description**.  Since the description provides no additional information to sway us from the base rate, the probability remains **0.75**.
