{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks any specific details that strongly correlate with being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" can be found in many professions, including both computer science and humanities.  We shouldn't rely on stereotypes.
* **Humanities Fit:** The description might even be seen as slightly more fitting with a humanities professor, given the mention of "reading" and not being "particularly technical."  
* **Base Rates are Crucial:** The most important factor is the base rate. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science and a 25% chance they are from humanities.

**Without stronger indicators related to his profession, the probability is best represented by the base rate of humanities professors in the study.**
