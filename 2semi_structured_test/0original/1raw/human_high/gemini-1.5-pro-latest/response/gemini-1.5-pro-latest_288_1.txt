**Reasoning:** 

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 100 professors, which is not a very large or necessarily representative sample.

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to suggest Jason is in computer science or humanities, we default to the base rate.**  25% of the professors in the study are from the humanities, and 75% are from computer science.  Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study.
