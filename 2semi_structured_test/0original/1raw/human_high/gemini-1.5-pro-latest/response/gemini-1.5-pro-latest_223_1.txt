{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description might seem to align with some stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, enjoys reading). However, relying on stereotypes is dangerous and inaccurate. 
* **Personality traits are not exclusive:**  Traits like creativity, imagination, and passion can be found in successful individuals across many fields, including computer science.  
* **Base rate is important:**  The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science. 

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to override the base rate, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor should be closer to the original proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
