{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why my probability leans slightly towards computer science:

* **Age:** 36 is relatively young for a tenured professor. Computer science, as a field, might offer faster career progression than some humanities disciplines. 
* **"Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"**:  This statement presents a slight contradiction. While many computer scientists are highly technical, there are areas within the field (like theoretical computer science or computer science education) where a less technical focus could be successful. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description focuses on personality traits that are not necessarily exclusive to either field. Creativity, imagination, and a love for exploration can be found in both computer science and the humanities. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study's relatively small sample size of 100 professors limits the generalizability of any observed patterns.

**Therefore, my probability of 0.3 reflects a slight leaning towards computer science based on limited information, but it's crucial to understand that this is a very uncertain estimate.**
