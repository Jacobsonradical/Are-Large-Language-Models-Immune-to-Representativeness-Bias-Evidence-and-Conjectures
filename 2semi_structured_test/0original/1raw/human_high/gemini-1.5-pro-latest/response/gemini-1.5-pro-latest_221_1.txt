**Reasoning:** 

Since we are not given any information about the personality traits of the professors in each field, we cannot make any assumptions based on the description.  Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample.

* There are 75 computer science professors.
* There are 100 professors in total.

The probability is 75/100 = 0.75. However, the question asks for the probability that Jason is **one of** the computer science professors, implying we are choosing a specific professor from the sample.  Since there are 100 professors, the probability of choosing any specific professor is 1/100.

To get the final probability, we multiply the probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science by the probability that we've chosen Jason specifically: 0.75 * (1/100) = 0.0075.  

Since 0.0075 is very close to 0, it's more intuitive to present the answer as a probability closer to 0.25. This acknowledges the significant likelihood that Jason is *not* the specific computer science professor we're looking for.
