{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to associate traits like "creative" and "not particularly technical" with humanities over computer science. However, these are broad generalizations and can be misleading. 
* **Base rates matter:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75/100 = 0.75) that any randomly chosen professor from the study is in computer science. 

**Without more information directly related to Jason's research or academic interests, it's more probable that he's part of the larger group (computer science) based purely on the study's composition.**

**Important Note:**  My reasoning relies heavily on the base rates in the study. In reality, the relationship between personality traits and academic fields is complex and cannot be accurately determined from a brief description.
