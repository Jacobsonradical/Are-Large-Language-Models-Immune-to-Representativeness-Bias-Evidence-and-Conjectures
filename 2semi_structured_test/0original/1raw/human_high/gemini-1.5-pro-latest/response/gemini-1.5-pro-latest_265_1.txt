{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is a harmful stereotype.  Many successful people in STEM fields are creative and emotionally intelligent.
* **Description is vague:**  Terms like "gifted" and "passionate" are applicable to both fields.  
* **Base Rate is important:**  The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of the description belonging to a computer science professor. 

**Without stronger indicators related to Jason's work style, research interests, or specific skills, the most logical approach is to lean towards the base rate.**  Therefore, there's a 25% probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
