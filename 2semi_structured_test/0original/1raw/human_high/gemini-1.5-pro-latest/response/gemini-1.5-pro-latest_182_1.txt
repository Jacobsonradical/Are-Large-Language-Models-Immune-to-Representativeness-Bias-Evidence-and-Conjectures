{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less likely to be emotionally driven or interested in humanities-related activities like reading and exploring. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable for predicting an individual's profession.
* **Small sample size:** The study only includes 100 professors, which is a relatively small sample size. This makes it harder to draw strong conclusions based on individual descriptions.

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to suggest Jason is in either field, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This represents a 75% probability, or 0.75.
* However, there's also a 25% probability, or 0.25, that Jason is one of the 25 humanities professors.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.25.**
