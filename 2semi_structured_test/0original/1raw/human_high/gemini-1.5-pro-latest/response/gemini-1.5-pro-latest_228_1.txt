{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study. 

Here's why my probability leans towards Jason being in the humanities:

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science. However...
* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** We must be careful not to rely on stereotypes.  While phrases like "not particularly technical" might seem to point away from computer science, it's important to remember:
    * There are many areas within computer science that are less focused on hardcore coding and more on theoretical concepts or design.
    *  Humanities professors can be quite tech-savvy. 

**Conclusion:**

Without more information directly related to Jason's research or teaching, it's most logical to lean towards the base rate. There's a 25% chance he's in the humanities and a 75% chance he's in computer science, but the description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to deviate significantly from those probabilities.
