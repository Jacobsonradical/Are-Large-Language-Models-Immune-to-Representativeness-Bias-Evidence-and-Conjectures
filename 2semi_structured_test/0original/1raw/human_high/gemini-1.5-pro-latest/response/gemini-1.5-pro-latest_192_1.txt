{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, a randomly selected professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities.  

The description of Jason doesn't strongly suggest he's in computer science *or* the humanities. It mentions he's "not particularly technical," which might make you think humanities, but that's not a strong enough indicator. 

**Without strong evidence from the description, we default to the base rates provided in the study.**
