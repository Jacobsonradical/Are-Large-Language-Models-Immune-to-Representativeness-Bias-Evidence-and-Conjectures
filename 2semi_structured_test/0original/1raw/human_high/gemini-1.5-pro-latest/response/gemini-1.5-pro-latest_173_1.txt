**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description of Jason that is particularly indicative of him being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Since the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, 25% of the professors in the study are humanities professors.  Therefore, based on the information given, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample, which is 0.25.
