{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why I chose a probability leaning towards him *not* being a computer science professor:

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 prior probability that any random professor in the study is from computer science.
* **Description:**  The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a love for travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are not exclusive to either field but are often associated with humanities.
* **"Not Particularly Technical":** This phrase leans heavily against Jason being a computer science professor. While not all computer scientists are extremely technical, it's a field that generally requires a strong technical aptitude.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are creative and enjoy activities like travel and reading. This answer is based on a probabilistic interpretation of the limited information provided and the base rates within the study sample.
