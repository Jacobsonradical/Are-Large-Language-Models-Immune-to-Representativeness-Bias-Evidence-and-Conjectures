{"probability": "0.25"} 

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:**  There is a significantly higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75 out of 100) than humanities professors (25 out of 100). This means there's a higher starting probability that Jason is in computer science.
* **Description:** The description provides some information, but it's not strongly indicative of either field.  While the phrase "not particularly technical" might suggest humanities, it's not definitive.  People in computer science can be creative, imaginative, and passionate about non-technical pursuits.
* **Limited Information:**  The description doesn't offer strong clues about Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests, which would be more informative.

**Given the lack of strong evidence, the probability should be closer to the base rate. Therefore, 0.25 is too low. A probability closer to 0.75 would be more appropriate.**
