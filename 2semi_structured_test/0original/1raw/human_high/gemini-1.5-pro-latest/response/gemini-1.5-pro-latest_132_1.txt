{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality and interests, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either field. 

Here's why I chose a probability leaning towards humanities (but not definitively):

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests that technical skills may not be his strong suit, which might make a computer science professorship less likely.
* **"Creative and imaginative", "emotionally driven"**:  These traits, while found in both fields, are often associated more strongly with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** This is a very weak inference.  Many computer scientists are creative and imaginative, and many humanities professors are highly technical. Without more information about Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests, it's impossible to be certain.
