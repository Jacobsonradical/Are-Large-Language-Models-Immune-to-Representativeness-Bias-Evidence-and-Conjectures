{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his profession.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer scientists are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are harmful stereotypes. People in technical fields can be just as creative, well-rounded, and emotionally intelligent as those in the humanities. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio â€“ a computer science professor is three times more likely to be selected at random than a humanities professor.

**Therefore, without any information directly linking Jason's personality traits to either field, the probability is based solely on the sample size.  There's a 25% chance Jason is in computer science (25 out of 100).**
