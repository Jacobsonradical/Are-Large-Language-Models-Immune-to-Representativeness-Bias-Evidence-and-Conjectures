{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information directly relevant to his field of study. 

Here's why 0.25 is the most logical probability:

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75% (0.75) chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science and a 25% (0.25) chance they're from the humanities.
* **Description Neutrality:** The description is somewhat stereotypical of professions associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading), but it doesn't definitively exclude him from computer science. Many computer scientists are also creative and enjoy those activities. 
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:**  The phrase "though not particularly technical" might suggest humanities, but it's not conclusive. Many successful academics might not be the most technically-minded within their field.

**Therefore, without stronger evidence, the probability should remain close to the base rate of humanities professors in the study, which is 0.25.**
