**Reasoning:**

Since we have no information about personality trends in the study, we have to rely on base rates. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there is a 75/100 = 0.75 chance of a randomly selected professor being in computer science and a 25/100 = 0.25 chance of them being in the humanities. 

The description of Jason provides no clear indication of whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we should stick to the base rate probability of him being in the humanities, which is 0.25.
