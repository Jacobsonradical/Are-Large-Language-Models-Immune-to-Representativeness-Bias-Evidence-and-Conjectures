{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, there's nothing definitively pointing towards him being a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming all computer science professors are highly technical and less emotionally driven is a harmful stereotype. Many successful individuals in STEM fields are creative, imaginative, and passionate. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 75 computer science professors, which is a small sample size to draw strong conclusions from. 
* **Base rate:** The base rate of humanities professors in the study is 25%, while the base rate for computer science professors is 75%. This means it's more likely, from the outset, that Jason is a computer science professor.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.75 (75/100).**
