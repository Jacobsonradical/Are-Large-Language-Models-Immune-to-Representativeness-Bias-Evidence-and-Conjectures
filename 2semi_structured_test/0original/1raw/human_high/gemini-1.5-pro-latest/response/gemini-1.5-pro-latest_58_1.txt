{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides no concrete information about his field of study. 

The study included:

* 75 computer science professors 
* 25 humanities professors

Therefore, there's a 75/100 chance that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science. This equates to a probability of 0.75.  However, the description leans slightly towards a humanities personality, thus I lower the probability to 0.25. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective assessment. The description is designed to be ambiguous, and there's not enough information to definitively determine Jason's profession.
