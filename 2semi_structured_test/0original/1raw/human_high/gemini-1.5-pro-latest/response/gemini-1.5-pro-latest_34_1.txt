{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information relevant to his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading than humanities professors is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 100 professors, which is not a large enough sample size to draw strong conclusions about personality traits and academic fields.

**The key factor:** The most important piece of information is the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study: 75:25.  This means there's a **3 times higher chance** that Jason is a computer science professor simply due to the study's composition. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.25 (25%) is a reasonable estimate, reflecting the baseline likelihood based on the study's sample proportions.**
