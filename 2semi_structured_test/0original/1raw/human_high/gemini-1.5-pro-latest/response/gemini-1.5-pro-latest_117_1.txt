{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no specific clues about his field of study. 

* The description highlights traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, a love for travel and exploration, and being gifted and passionate. These qualities are not exclusive to any particular academic field and can be found in both computer science and humanities professors.
* The mention of Jason not being "particularly technical" might seem like it points away from computer science. However, this is a subjective statement and doesn't preclude him from being in the field. There are many areas within computer science that are less technically focused and might appeal to someone with Jason's described traits (e.g., human-computer interaction, design, educational technology).

**Since we have no information about Jason's actual field, the prior probability of him being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

* There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100.
* This makes the probability 75/100 = 0.75.

**Therefore, without any further information, there's a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the sample composition.**
