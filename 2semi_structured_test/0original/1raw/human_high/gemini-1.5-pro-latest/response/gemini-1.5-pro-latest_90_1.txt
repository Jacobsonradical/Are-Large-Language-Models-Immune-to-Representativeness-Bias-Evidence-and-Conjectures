{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability of any given professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. 

However, the description of Jason is somewhat stereotypical of someone in a more creative and less technical field like humanities. This doesn't mean he *can't* be in computer science – there are creative and less technically-focused roles within that field too – but the description leans towards a humanities stereotype. 

Therefore, I've adjusted the probability downwards from the base 0.75 to 0.25. This is a subjective adjustment based on the provided description.
