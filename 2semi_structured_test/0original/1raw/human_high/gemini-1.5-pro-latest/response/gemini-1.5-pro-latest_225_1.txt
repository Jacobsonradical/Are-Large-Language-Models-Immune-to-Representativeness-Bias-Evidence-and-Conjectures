**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's personality description that strongly suggests he is in computer science or the humanities. Therefore, we should rely on base rates. 

* 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science. 
* This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science.
* However, we are told Jason is "not particularly technical."  This weakens the likelihood he is in computer science, though it doesn't eliminate the possibility (he could be in a less technical area of CS or have other strengths).

Considering the base rate and the slight evidence against computer science, I've adjusted the probability downwards. A probability of 0.25 (25%) feels like a reasonable estimate given the limited information.
