{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities can be technical:**  Fields like digital humanities or computational linguistics require strong technical skills. 
* **Personality isn't destiny:** While personality traits might be somewhat more common in certain fields, they don't dictate someone's profession.

**The Key:** The most important piece of information is the sample composition: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  This means there's a **3:1 ratio**, making it **three times more likely** that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science. 

**Therefore, without strong evidence pointing either way, the probability should heavily favor the larger group, leading to a probability close to the base rate of the computer science group.**
