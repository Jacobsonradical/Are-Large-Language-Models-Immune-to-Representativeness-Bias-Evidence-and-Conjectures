{"probability": "0.2"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not align with the stereotypical image of a computer scientist.
* **Humanities Stereotypes:** The description aligns slightly more with common stereotypes about professionals in the humanities (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading).  

**Important Note:** This is a very weak inference.  The description is heavily influenced by stereotypes and lacks concrete information about Jason's work habits, research interests, or specific skills. There's a significant chance Jason could be a computer scientist who defies typical stereotypes.
