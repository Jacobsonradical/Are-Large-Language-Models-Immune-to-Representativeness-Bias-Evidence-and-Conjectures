{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25/100 chance that Jason is a computer science professor. This simplifies to a probability of 0.25. 

**Important Note:** The description of Jason's personality is ultimately irrelevant in this calculation. The question specifically asks for the probability based on the sample composition, not on any perceived stereotypes about academics in different fields.
