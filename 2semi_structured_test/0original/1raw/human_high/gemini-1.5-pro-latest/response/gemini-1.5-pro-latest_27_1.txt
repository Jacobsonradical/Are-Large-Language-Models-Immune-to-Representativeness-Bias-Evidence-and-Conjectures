{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of his field of study. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators. 
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:**  The humanities encompass a wide range of disciplines (literature, history, philosophy, etc.).  Jason's creativity and lack of "technical" focus could easily fit within many humanities fields.

**Since we have no strong evidence to favor either computer science or humanities, the probability is based on the sample sizes:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a **25% chance (0.25 probability)** that any randomly selected professor from the study is in the humanities.
