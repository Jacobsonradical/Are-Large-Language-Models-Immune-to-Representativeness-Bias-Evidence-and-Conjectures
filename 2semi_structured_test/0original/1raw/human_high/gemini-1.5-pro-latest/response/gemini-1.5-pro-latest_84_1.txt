{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in the arts. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities can be technical:** Fields like digital humanities or computational linguistics require significant technical expertise.
* **Sample size matters:** The study had 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This means a randomly chosen professor is three times more likely to be from computer science.

**Therefore, without strong evidence pointing towards either field, the prior probability based purely on the sample size (75/100) is the most reliable estimate.**
