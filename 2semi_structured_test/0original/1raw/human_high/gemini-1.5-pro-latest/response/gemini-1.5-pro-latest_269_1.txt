{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of his field of study. 

* The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate) could apply to successful individuals in various fields, including both computer science and humanities. 
* The lack of "technical" inclination might suggest humanities, but it's not definitive. Many successful computer scientists are more focused on theoretical or conceptual aspects than pure technical skills.

Since there is no clear indication of Jason's field, the probability is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

* 75 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75 

However, the question asks for the probability of Jason being **one specific** computer science professor out of the 75.  Since each professor is equally likely to be selected:

* 1 / 75 = 0.0133

To get the final probability, we multiply the probability of Jason being in the computer science group by the probability of him being the specific computer science professor described:

* 0.75 * 0.0133 = **0.25** (approximately)
