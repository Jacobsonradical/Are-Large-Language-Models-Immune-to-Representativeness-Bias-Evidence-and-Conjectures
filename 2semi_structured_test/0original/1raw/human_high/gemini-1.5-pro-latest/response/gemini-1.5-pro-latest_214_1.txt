**Reasoning:**

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a 75/100 = 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science. 

However, the description of Jason doesn't strongly signal one field over the other.  While it mentions he's "not particularly technical," this doesn't definitively rule out computer science.  He could be in a theoretical or design-focused area of CS.

Without stronger indicators, the prior probability (75%) should be adjusted downwards, but not drastically. A probability of 0.25 represents a significant decrease, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the description.
