{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less creative or emotionally driven. However, this is a harmful stereotype. Many computer scientists are highly creative and passionate about their work.
* **Humanities Stereotypes:**  Similarly, assuming humanities professors are less technical is also a stereotype. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study has a relatively small sample size (100 professors). This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about personality traits and their correlation with specific fields.

**Baseline Probability:**

With no information other than the existence of the two groups, the probability of Jason being in computer science is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

* 75 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75

**Description's Influence:**

The description offers some potential hints that *slightly* decrease the probability of Jason being in computer science:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: While this could apply to some computer scientists, it might be considered slightly more typical of someone in the humanities. 

However, this is a very weak indicator and shouldn't drastically shift the probability. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the weak evidence, it's
