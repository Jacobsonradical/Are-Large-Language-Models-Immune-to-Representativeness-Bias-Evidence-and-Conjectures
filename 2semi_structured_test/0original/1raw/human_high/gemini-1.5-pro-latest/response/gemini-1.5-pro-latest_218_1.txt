{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards him being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description plays into some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) but these are not universally true nor exclusive to humanities. Computer science can also be a highly creative field.
* **Technical skill is not mentioned:**  The statement "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science, but it's not definitive. Many successful academics, even in technical fields, may not be the most hands-on technical person.

**The Importance of Base Rate:**

Since we are given no further information about how the personality traits correlate to the professions, the most important factor is the base rate provided in the study's description:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science. 
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75 or 75%. However, since you requested a probability between 0 and 1, the answer is 0.25.**
