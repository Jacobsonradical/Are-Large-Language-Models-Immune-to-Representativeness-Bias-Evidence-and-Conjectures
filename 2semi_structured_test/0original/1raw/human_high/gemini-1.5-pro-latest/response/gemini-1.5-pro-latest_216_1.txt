{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides no concrete information to directly suggest he's a computer science professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Basing our answer on stereotypical images of computer science professors (logical, technical) versus humanities professors (creative, emotionally driven) would be a mistake. These stereotypes are often inaccurate and don't reflect the diversity within each field. 
* **Base Rate is key:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly selected professor being in computer science. 

**Therefore, without any specific clues about Jason's profession, the probability leans towards him being a computer science professor simply because they represent a larger portion of the study sample.**
