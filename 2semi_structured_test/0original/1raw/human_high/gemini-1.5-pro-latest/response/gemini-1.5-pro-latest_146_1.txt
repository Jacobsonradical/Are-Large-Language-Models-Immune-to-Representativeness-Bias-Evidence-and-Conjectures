**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that strongly suggests he is either a computer science or humanities professor.  The description focuses on personality traits that could be found in individuals from either field. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (25%)

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the study.
