{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming all computer scientists are technical and lacking in emotional depth is a harmful stereotype. Many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and passionate individuals.
* **Humanities professors can be technical:**  Digital humanities is a growing field, and many humanities professors utilize technology extensively in their research and teaching. 

**The Base Rate:**

The most important factor here is the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities (25%)

**Without any strong indicators from the description to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other, the probability should be heavily influenced by the base rate. Therefore, there's a higher prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.**

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment. It's entirely possible that Jason is a humanities professor, but based on the information given and the base rates, it's statistically more likely he's in computer science.
