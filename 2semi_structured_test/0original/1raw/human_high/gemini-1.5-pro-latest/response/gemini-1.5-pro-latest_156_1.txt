**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description that directly relates to Jason's likelihood of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description highlights personality traits and hobbies that could be found in individuals from various professions.  

Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the initial study description:

* 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science. 
* 25 out of 100 professors were from the humanities.

This means there's a **75% chance** a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science and a **25% chance** they are in the humanities. 

Since the personality description doesn't offer any clues to sway us from these base rates, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains the same as the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.
