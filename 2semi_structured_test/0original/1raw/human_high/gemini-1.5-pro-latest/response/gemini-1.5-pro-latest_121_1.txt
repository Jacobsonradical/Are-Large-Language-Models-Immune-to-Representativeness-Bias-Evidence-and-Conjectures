{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing directly pointing towards him being a computer science professor. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical) could be applicable to professors in various fields, including humanities. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.

However, the question asks specifically about Jason, who is described as "not particularly technical." This makes it slightly less likely he's in computer science, though it doesn't eliminate the possibility entirely.  

Considering this information, a probability of **0.25 (25%)** seems like a reasonable estimate. This is a subjective adjustment from the base rate, acknowledging the description while still recognizing the limited information available.
