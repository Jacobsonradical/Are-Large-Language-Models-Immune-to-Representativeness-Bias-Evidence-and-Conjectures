{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25% chance a randomly selected professor is from humanities. The description provided leans towards stereotypical traits associated with humanities, but it lacks strong indicators to definitively categorize Jason's profession.  Without further information, the base rate (25% chance) is the most reliable estimate.
