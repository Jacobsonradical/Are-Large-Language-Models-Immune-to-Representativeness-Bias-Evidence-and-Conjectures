**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insight into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either field.  Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in the arts.  These are harmful stereotypes. 
* **Humanities allows for broader interests:**  The description of Jason enjoying travel, reading, and exploring could align with someone in a humanities field where these pursuits might directly inform their work. 

**Important Note:** My answer is a very rough estimate.  To provide a more accurate probability, I would need:

* **Baseline information:** What's the general distribution of personality traits within *both* computer science and humanities professors?  
* **More specific traits:** The description is somewhat vague. Knowing Jason's specific strengths in creativity and imagination (e.g., writing code vs. writing poetry) would be far more helpful.
