{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of his field of study. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading than humanities professors. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 100 professors, which is a relatively small sample size. This makes it harder to draw strong conclusions about personality traits and their correlation to academic fields.

**Baseline Probability:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the baseline probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. 

**Lack of Strong Evidence:**

The description doesn't provide any strong evidence to shift our belief significantly away from this baseline probability. Therefore, a probability close to the baseline, like 0.25 (which is the complement of 0.75), is a reasonable estimate.
