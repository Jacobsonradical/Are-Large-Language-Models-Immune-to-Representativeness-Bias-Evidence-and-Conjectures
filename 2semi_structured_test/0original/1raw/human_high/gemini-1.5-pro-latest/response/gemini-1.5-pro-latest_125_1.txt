**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him within either field. Here's why my probability leans towards him not being a computer science professor:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This statement directly contrasts with the common perception of computer science professors. While not all computer scientists are the same, technical proficiency is fundamental to the field.
* **Focus on creativity and emotional drive**:  The description emphasizes these traits, which, while not exclusive to humanities, are often seen as more central in fields like literature, arts, or philosophy. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative assessment. Many computer science professionals are creative and emotionally driven, and many humanities scholars are technically skilled.  Without more information about Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests, it's impossible to be certain. 

Given the limited information and the base rate of 75 computer science professors to 25 humanities professors, a probability of 0.2 (20%) reflects a slightly higher likelihood of Jason belonging to the larger group (humanities) while acknowledging the possibility that he could be a computer science professor with a less typical profile.
