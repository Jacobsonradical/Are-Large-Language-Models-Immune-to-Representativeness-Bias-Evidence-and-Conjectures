**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him within either computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" are often associated with humanities, but they are not exclusive to the field. Computer science can involve significant creativity and passion as well.
* **Technical ability isn't mentioned:** The statement "not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is a single data point and doesn't preclude Jason from being a successful computer scientist in other areas like theoretical computer science or human-computer interaction.

**The Base Rate is Crucial:** 

Since the sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate for a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75 or 75%.

**Considering the limited information, it's more reliable to lean towards the base rate probability. However, we adjust slightly downwards to account for the "not particularly technical" comment. **
