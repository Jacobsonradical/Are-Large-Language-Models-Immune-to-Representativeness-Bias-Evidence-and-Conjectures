**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why I chose a probability leaning towards humanities:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests a lower likelihood of being in a highly technical field like computer science.
* **"Creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys...reading and exploring"**: These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, align more commonly with stereotypes associated with those fields.

**Important Note:**  Stereotypes are not accurate predictors of individual professions. This answer is based on limited information and general perceptions. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about someone's career solely based on personality traits.
