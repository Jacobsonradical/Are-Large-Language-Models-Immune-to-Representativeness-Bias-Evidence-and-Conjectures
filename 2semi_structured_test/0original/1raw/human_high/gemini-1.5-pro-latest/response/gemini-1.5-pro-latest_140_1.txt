**Reasoning:**

This description emphasizes creativity, emotional drive, and a non-technical nature. These traits are not stereotypical of computer science professors, who are often associated with logic, analytical thinking, and technical proficiency. 

While it's possible for a computer scientist to possess these traits, the description aligns more with common perceptions of humanities professors. 

Since 25% of the sample were humanities professors (25 out of 100), the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the remaining 75%, or **0.75**. However, the question asks for the probability of him being a computer science professor,  making the answer **0.25**.
