{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information relevant to his field of study.  

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. There's a 25% chance Jason is a humanities professor (25 out of 100) and a 75% chance he's a computer science professor (75 out of 100). This prior probability is crucial.
* **Stereotypes vs. Evidence:** We might be tempted to associate "technical" with computer science. However, the description notes Jason is "not particularly technical." While this might nudge us slightly towards humanities, it's not strong evidence. Many successful computer science professors might not be exceptionally technically hands-on, especially in fields like theoretical computer science.
* **Insufficient Information:** The description focuses on personal traits, not professional ones.  

**Conclusion:**  

Without more information directly related to Jason's work or academic achievements, the safest bet is to stick close to the base rate. There's a higher probability he's in the larger group (computer science), but we don't have enough to make a confident judgment.
