**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, a randomly chosen professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities. The description of Jason doesn't offer strong evidence to sway us heavily from this baseline probability. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** While there might be a stereotype that computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in the humanities, these are broad generalizations and not accurate predictors for an individual.
* **Description emphasizes "not technical":**  The phrase "though not particularly technical" might suggest a humanities professor, but it's not definitive. Many computer science fields are less focused on hands-on technical skills and more on theoretical or abstract concepts.

**Therefore, in the absence of strong indicators either way, the baseline probability of 25% (25 out of 100) remains the most logical estimate.**
