**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a professor randomly chosen from the study has a 75/100 = 0.75 probability of being in computer science and a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of being in the humanities. 

The description provided leans towards stereotypes often associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, not particularly technical). However, these stereotypes are not definitive indicators of profession.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on stereotypes. While the description might align more with common perceptions of humanities professors, it doesn't definitively exclude Jason from being in computer science.
