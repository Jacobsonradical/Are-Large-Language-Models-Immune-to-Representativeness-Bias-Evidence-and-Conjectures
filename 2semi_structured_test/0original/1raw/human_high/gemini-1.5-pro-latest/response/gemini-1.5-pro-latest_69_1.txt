{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into his field of study.  

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in humanities. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Stereotypes vs. Evidence:** The description might play into stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of someone's profession. 
* **Lack of Technical Information:** The statement "though not particularly technical" might suggest humanities, but it's not conclusive. Many computer science fields value creativity and big-picture thinking over pure technical skill.

**Without more information directly related to Jason's research or teaching, the probability should be closer to the base rate of a professor being in computer science, which is 0.75. However, since the description leans slightly towards humanities stereotypes, I've adjusted the probability slightly downwards to 0.25.**
