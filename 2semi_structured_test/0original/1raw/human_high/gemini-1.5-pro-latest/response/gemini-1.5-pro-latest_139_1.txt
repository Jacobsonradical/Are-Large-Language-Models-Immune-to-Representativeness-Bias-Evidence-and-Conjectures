{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is particularly indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Since the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a 75/100 chance that a randomly selected professor is in computer science. This simplifies to a probability of 0.75. However, we are asked about Jason specifically, and he is one of 100 professors.  Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is **0.25**.
