{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. 

However, the description of Jason does not strongly suggest a computer science background.  Here's why:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase works against the stereotype of a computer science professor.
* **Creative, imaginative, emotionally driven**: These traits are often associated with humanities fields. 

While it's entirely possible for a computer science professor to have these traits, the description leans slightly towards a humanities profile.  Therefore, I've adjusted the probability downwards from the base 0.75. I am hesitant to go too low, as the description doesn't definitively rule out computer science.
