**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is particularly indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  The traits described could apply to individuals in either field. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (25%)

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is **0.75**.  However, the question asks for the probability of him being **one of** the computer science professors.  Since he's just one individual within that group, the probability would be **0.25** (1 out of 4, proportionately reflecting the 75/25 split).
