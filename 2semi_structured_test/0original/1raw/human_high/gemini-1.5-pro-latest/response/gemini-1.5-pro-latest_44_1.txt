**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study. Here's why a probability leaning towards lower is more appropriate:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less likely to be emotionally driven or interested in humanities-related activities. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Sample size difference:** The study includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 chance that a randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science. 

**Therefore, without any information directly related to his field, the probability should be closer to the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.25 (25%).**
