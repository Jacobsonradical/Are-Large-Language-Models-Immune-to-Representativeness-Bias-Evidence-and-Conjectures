**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that explicitly connects him to either computer science or humanities. Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities (25%)

Since we have no additional information about Jason's field, there is a 25% probability that he is one of the humanities professors.
