{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no specific clues about his field of study. 

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate.  Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science (75%) and 25 are in humanities (25%).  
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description leans towards stereotypically "artistic" traits, but these are not exclusive to humanities.  Many computer scientists are creative and imaginative.  
* **Avoiding Bias:** It's crucial to avoid letting our own biases about academics influence the answer.  

**Therefore, without any strong indicators from the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75 or 75%.**
