{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description itself that suggests whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there is a 75% chance (or a probability of 0.75) that any randomly chosen professor from this study is a computer science professor.

However, the prompt asks for the probability given that the professor is named Jason.  Assuming the name "Jason" doesn't correlate with a specific field, it doesn't change the overall probability.  

Since 25% of the professors are in the humanities, there is a 25% chance (or a probability of 0.25) that Jason is one of them.
