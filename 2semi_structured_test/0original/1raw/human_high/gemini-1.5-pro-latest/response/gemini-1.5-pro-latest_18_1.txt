{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is based on stereotypes, not evidence.
* **Individual variation:**  Personality traits within any profession are diverse. Many computer scientists can be creative and emotionally driven, just like many humanities professors might be technically inclined.

**The Key:**  We have no information about the content of Jason's work, his research interests, or his teaching style. 

**Since the sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors (a 3:1 ratio), in the absence of strong indicators from the description, the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor simply due to the higher representation in the sample.**
