{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, there's nothing explicitly tying him to either computer science or humanities.  Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) for a randomly selected professor to be in computer science.
* **Stereotypes:** The description might play into common stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these are just stereotypes and don't definitively place Jason in either field. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information.  Without more concrete details related to Jason's work or interests, it's impossible to give a highly confident probability.
