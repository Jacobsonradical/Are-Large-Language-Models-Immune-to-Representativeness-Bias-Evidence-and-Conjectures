{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of whether he is in computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Traits like "creative," "imaginative," and "passionate" are often associated with humanities fields, but they can also apply to individuals in STEM fields. Many areas of computer science, such as artificial intelligence or human-computer interaction, require significant creativity. 
* **The description is vague:** The statement "not particularly technical" could be interpreted in various ways and doesn't definitively rule out computer science. 

**Since the description is not informative, we fall back to the base rate provided in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 75% chance (or a probability of 0.75) that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.

**However, the question asks about the probability given the description. Since the description is not informative, the probability remains the same as the base rate.**
