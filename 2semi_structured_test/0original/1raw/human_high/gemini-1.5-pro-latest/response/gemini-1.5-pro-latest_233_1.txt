{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "emotionally driven" are often stereotypically associated with humanities, but these stereotypes don't hold true in all cases. Computer science can also be a highly creative field.
* **No technical skill mentioned:** The description specifically states Jason is "not particularly technical." While this might suggest a humanities leaning, it's not definitive. There are subfields within computer science that may not require heavy technical expertise. 

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence in either direction, the most logical approach is to rely on the base rate:**

* The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
* This means there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
* Since we have no strong indicators about Jason, we should lean towards the higher probability.

**However, it's crucial to note that this is just a probability based on limited information.  The actual chance could be different.**
