**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  The description plays into some stereotypical views of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading) but stereotypes are not accurate predictors of profession. 
* **Technical skill is not mentioned:** The description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical."  While this might suggest he's less likely to be in computer science, it's not a guarantee. There are areas within computer science where technical skills are less central (e.g., theoretical computer science).
* **Base rate is important:** The most important factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science. This means there's a higher starting probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor, including Jason, is in computer science.

**Considering the base rate, while the description leans slightly away from a computer science stereotype, there's still a reasonable chance Jason belongs to that group. A probability of 0.3 (30%) reflects this uncertainty.**
