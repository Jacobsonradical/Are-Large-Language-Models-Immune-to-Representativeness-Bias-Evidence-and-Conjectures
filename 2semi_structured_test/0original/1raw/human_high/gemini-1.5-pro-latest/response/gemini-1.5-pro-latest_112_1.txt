{"probability": "0.25"}

**Explanation:**

There is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:**  We should avoid relying on stereotypes about computer science professors (e.g., that they are less creative or emotionally driven).  Personality traits are complex and vary greatly within any profession.
* **Base rates are important:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75/100 (or 75%) chance a randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science and a 25/100 (or 25%) chance they are in the humanities. 

**Since the description provides no relevant information to adjust the probabilities, we stick with the base rate. **
