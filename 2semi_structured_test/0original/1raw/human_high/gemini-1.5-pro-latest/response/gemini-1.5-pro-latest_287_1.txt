{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why a lower probability leaning towards humanities is more likely:

* **Lack of "Technical" Trait:** The description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical."  While not all computer science professors are extremely technical, it's a field where technical aptitude is generally assumed to be important.
* **Creative and Emotionally Driven:** These traits, while not exclusive to the humanities, are often associated with fields like literature, art, or philosophy.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are many creative and emotionally driven computer scientists, just as there are highly technical individuals in the humanities.  However, based on the limited information and the way the description is framed, a lower probability assigned to computer science seems more justifiable.
