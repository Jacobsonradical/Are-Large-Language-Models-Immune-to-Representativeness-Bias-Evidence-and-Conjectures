{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description itself that suggests whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description focuses on personality traits and hobbies that could apply to someone in either field. 

Therefore, the only relevant information we have is the composition of the sample:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (25%)

Since we have no other information to go on, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is **0.25 or 25%**.
