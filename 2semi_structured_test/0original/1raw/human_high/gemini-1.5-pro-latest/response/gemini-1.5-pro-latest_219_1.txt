**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's profession or any strong correlation between the provided description and computer science, we can only use the base rate from the study. 

* There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
* This means 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* Therefore, there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science. 

However, the question asks for the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description. The description, arguably, leans slightly away from a typical computer science stereotype, though it's not definitive.  Therefore, a slight adjustment downwards from 75% is reasonable. 

**It's crucial to understand:** This is a subjective adjustment. A different person might not adjust the probability at all, or might adjust it differently.  The provided description doesn't offer strong evidence to deviate significantly from the base rate.
