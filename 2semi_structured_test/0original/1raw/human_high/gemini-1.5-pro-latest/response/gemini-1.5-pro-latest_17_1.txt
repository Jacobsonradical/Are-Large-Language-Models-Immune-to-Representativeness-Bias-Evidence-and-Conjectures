**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, it offers little information directly relevant to his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be found in professors from various disciplines. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study description:

* 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
* 25 out of 100 professors are from the humanities.

Given no other information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is **0.75 or 75%**. 

However, the prompt requests a probability that Jason is **not** one of the computer science professors, making the probability **0.25 or 25%**.
