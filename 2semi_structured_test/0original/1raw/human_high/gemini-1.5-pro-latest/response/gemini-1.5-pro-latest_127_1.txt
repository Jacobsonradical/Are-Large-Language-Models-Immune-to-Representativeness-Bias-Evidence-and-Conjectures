**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why I leaned towards a lower probability:

* **Lack of Technical Mention:** The description explicitly states Jason is "not particularly technical."  While not all computer science professors are extremely technical, it's a field where technical aptitude is generally assumed.
* **Creative and Emotionally Driven:** These traits, while not exclusive to humanities, are often associated with fields like literature, arts, and philosophy. 
* **Small Sample Bias:**  Keep in mind the sample size. There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. If we had no information about Jason, the baseline probability of him being in computer science would be 0.75. However, the provided description pushes us slightly away from that baseline.

**Important Note:** This is a highly speculative exercise. Personality traits are not reliable predictors of profession, and this is based on a limited description and a small, potentially biased sample.
