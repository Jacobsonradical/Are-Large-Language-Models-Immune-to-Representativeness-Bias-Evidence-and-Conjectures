{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into his field of study. 

* The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, passion, and a non-technical inclination. These traits are not exclusive to humanities professors; computer scientists, especially those involved in research or human-computer interaction, can also possess these qualities.
* The information about Jason's age, marital status, and hobbies is irrelevant in determining his profession. 

Since the study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. The provided description does not offer strong evidence to significantly alter this prior probability. 

While the description might slightly decrease the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor due to the "not particularly technical" comment, it's not definitive. Therefore, a probability slightly lower than the prior, like 0.25, seems reasonable.
