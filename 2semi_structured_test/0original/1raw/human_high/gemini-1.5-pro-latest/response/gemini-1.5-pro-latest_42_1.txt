{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to associate traits like "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't account for the diversity within academic fields.
* **Base Rates are Crucial:**  The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor from the study is in computer science. 

**Without stronger evidence leaning one way or another, the best estimate is to stick close to the base rate probability of the larger group.**
