{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of his field of study. 

* The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate) could apply to successful academics in various fields, including both computer science and the humanities.
* The mention of Jason being "not particularly technical" might suggest he is less likely to be in computer science. However, this is not definitive, as there are areas within computer science that are less technically focused and may appeal to someone with Jason's described traits.

Since we have no strong indicators favoring either field, the most logical approach is to rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (25%)

Given the lack of information steering us in a different direction, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is best represented by the base rate of **0.25** or **25%**.
