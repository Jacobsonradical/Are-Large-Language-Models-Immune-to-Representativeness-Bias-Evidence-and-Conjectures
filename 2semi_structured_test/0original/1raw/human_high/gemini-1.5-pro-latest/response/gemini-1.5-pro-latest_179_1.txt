{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or creative than humanities professors is a harmful stereotype.  Personality traits are complex and vary greatly within any profession.
* **"Not particularly technical" is vague:** This could mean many things. A humanities professor might say this, but so might a computer science professor specializing in a less technical area like human-computer interaction or theoretical computer science.

**Since the description doesn't offer strong evidence to suggest Jason is in computer science, and there's a 75/25 split in the sample, a probability leaning towards the smaller group (25% or 0.25) is a more cautious and less biased estimate.**
