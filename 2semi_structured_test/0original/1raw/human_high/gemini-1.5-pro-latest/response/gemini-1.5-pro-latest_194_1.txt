{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study.  

Here's why I arrived at 0.25:

* **Base Rate:** The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability a randomly chosen professor is in computer science and a 25/100 = 0.25 probability they are in the humanities.
* **Description Neutrality:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a love for travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **Lack of Technical Mention:**  The statement "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is weak evidence, as many areas within computer science (like theoretical computer science or AI ethics) don't necessarily require someone to be exceptionally technical. 

**Without stronger indicators related to Jason's academic or professional interests, the most logical probability is to stick close to the base rate of the sample, which is 0.25 for a humanities professor.**
