{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not accurate predictors.
* **Humanities is a broad field:**  Humanities encompass diverse areas like literature, philosophy, history, etc.  This makes it equally difficult to assess Jason's fit based on the description.

**The key lies in the sample sizes:**

* **75 Computer Science professors:** This is 75% of the sample.
* **25 Humanities professors:** This is 25% of the sample.

**Without strong evidence favoring either field, the base rate (prior probability) is the best estimate.**  Therefore, there's a higher probability (75% chance) that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science. 

**Important Note:** This doesn't mean Jason *is* a computer science professor, just that it's statistically more likely given the information provided.
