{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he would be more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** The description might seem to align with some stereotypes of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, relying on stereotypes is not a statistically sound way to determine probability.
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor to consider is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors in the study, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities.  This means there's a 75% (0.75) prior probability that any randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science and a 25% (0.25) probability they are in the humanities.

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to shift significantly from the base rate, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains close to the base rate probability of the sample.**
