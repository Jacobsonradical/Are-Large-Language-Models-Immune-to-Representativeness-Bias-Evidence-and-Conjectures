{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's profession or interests that directly relate to computer science or humanities, we have to rely on the base rate provided in the study.

* There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
* This means 75% of the professors in the study were from computer science and 25% were from humanities.

Therefore, without any further information about Jason's field, the probability of him being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.25 or 25%.
