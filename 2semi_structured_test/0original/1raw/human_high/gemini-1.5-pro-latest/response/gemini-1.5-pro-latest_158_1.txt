{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insight into Jason's personality, it offers little information relevant to his field of study. 

* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science, regardless of their personality. 
* **Description:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a love for travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. While the statement "not particularly technical" might seem like it points away from computer science, it's not definitive. Many successful academics in various fields may not consider themselves highly technical.

**Therefore, without stronger evidence, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of the sample, which is 0.75. However, the slight hint of being "not particularly technical" might nudge the probability slightly lower, hence my choice of 0.25.**
