{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of his field of study. 

* The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a passion for travel, reading, and exploration. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* The statement that Jason is "not particularly technical" might suggest a bias towards humanities. However, it's not definitive. There are areas within computer science that are less technical and more focused on design, human-computer interaction, or computational aspects of humanities disciplines. 

**Therefore, without any strong indicators, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a 75% (or 0.75) probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

**However, the question asks specifically about Jason, who is already identified as one of the 100 professors.  This means we are selecting from a pool where there's already one less computer science professor.  Therefore, the probability is slightly lower than 0.75.**

To be precise: 74 remaining computer science professors divided by 99 total remaining professors equals approximately 0.747.  **Since the question asks for a number between 0 and 1, 0.25 is too low, and the closest reasonable answer is still approximately 0.75 (rounding up from 0.747).**
