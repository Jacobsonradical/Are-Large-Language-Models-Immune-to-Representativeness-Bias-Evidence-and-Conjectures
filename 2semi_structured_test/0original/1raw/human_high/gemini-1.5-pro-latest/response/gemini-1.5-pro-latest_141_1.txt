{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study.  Here's why a probability leaning towards lower is more appropriate:

* **Base Rate:** The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly selected professor being in computer science. 
* **Stereotypes:** We might be tempted to associate traits like "creative and imaginative" or "not particularly technical" with humanities. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators.  Computer scientists can be highly creative and imaginative as well.

**Without stronger evidence related to Jason's academic work, relying on the base rate (proportion of computer science professors in the study) is a more statistically sound approach.** Since 25% of the professors are in the humanities, there's a 25% chance Jason is one of them.
