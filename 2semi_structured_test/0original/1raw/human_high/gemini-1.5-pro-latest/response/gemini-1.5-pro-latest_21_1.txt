{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it doesn't offer strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities can be technical:**  Fields like digital humanities or computational linguistics within the humanities require significant technical skills.
* **The description is relatively neutral:**  The description highlights creativity, imagination, and passion, which can be found in both computer science and humanities professors. 

**Since we have no strong evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other, and the sample size of computer science professors (75) is three times larger than humanities professors (25), the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor simply due to the sample size difference.**

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about someone's profession based on limited personality descriptions. This response is based purely on the information provided and the study's sample sizes.
