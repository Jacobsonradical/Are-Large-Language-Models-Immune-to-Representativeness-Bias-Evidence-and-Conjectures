{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  It's tempting to associate traits like "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes that may not hold true for all individuals. 
* **Humanities can be creative:**  Fields within the humanities, like literature, history, and philosophy, often require creativity, imagination, and passion.
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly selected professor from this study will be from computer science.

**Therefore, without stronger indicators related to Jason's academic field, the probability is best represented by the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 25/100 or 0.25.**
