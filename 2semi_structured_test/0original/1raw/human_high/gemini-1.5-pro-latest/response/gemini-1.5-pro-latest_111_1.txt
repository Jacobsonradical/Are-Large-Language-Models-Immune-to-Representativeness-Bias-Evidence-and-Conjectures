{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into his field of study. 

* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards computer science (e.g., mentions of logic, problem-solving, systems) or humanities (e.g., specific areas of interest like history, literature).
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science and a 25% chance they are from humanities.

**Therefore, without any strong indicators from the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rate, which is 25%.**
