{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since we have no information about the personality traits themselves, the description of Jason is irrelevant. The only useful information is the number of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. 

* There are 75 computer science professors.
* There are 25 humanities professors.
* This means there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.

**However:** The question asks for the probability that **Jason**, a **specific** professor with a description, is in computer science.  Since we have 100 descriptions and we're picking one at random, there's a 1/100 chance we picked any individual professor's description.

To get the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we multiply the probability of picking his description (1/100) by the probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (0.75):

(1/100) * 0.75 = 0.0075 = **approximately 0.25 when rounded to a single decimal place.**
