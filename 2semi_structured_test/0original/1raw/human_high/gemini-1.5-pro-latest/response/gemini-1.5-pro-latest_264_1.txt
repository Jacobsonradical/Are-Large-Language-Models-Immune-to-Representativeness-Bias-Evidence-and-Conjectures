{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, a randomly selected professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities (25/100 = 0.25).

**Important Note:** The personality description provided is largely irrelevant. Personality traits are not reliable indicators of profession, and relying on stereotypes can lead to biased judgments.
