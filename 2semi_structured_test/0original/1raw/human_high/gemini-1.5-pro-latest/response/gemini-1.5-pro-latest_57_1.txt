**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description itself that suggests whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study's description.

* There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
* This means there is a 75/100 = 0.75 probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science.
* Conversely, there is a 25/100 = 0.25 probability of a randomly selected professor being in humanities.

Since the description offers no additional clues, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the base rate for computer science professors in the sample.
