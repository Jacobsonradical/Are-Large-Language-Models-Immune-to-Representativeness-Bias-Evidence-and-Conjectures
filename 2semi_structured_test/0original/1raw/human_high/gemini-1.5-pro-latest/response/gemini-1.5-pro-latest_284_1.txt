**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative. However, these are stereotypes and not accurate predictors.
* **Humanities can be technical:** Fields like digital humanities or computational linguistics require significant technical skills.

Since the description doesn't offer strong evidence to favor either field, we should rely on the base probability. There's a 25% chance Jason is in humanities (25 out of 100 professors) and a 75% chance he's in computer science (75 out of 100). 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate probability of a randomly chosen professor from the study being in computer science, which is 0.75. However, the question specifically asks for the probability that he's in computer science given the description. Without any information relating the description to the field of study, we have to ignore the description. This leaves us with the prior probability of 0.25 (25 out of 100 professors).**
