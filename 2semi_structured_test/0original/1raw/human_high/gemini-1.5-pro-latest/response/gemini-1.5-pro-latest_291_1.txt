{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality and interests, it offers little to no direct correlation with his profession (computer science or humanities). 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming someone in computer science must be technical and someone in the humanities must be creative is a harmful stereotype.  People in both fields exhibit a wide range of personalities and skills.
* **Base rate is crucial:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science.

**Since the description provides no strong evidence to sway us from the base rate, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains close to the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
