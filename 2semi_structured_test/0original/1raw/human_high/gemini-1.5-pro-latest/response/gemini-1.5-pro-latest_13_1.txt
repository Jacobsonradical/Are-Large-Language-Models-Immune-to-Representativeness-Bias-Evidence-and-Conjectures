{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Assuming all computer scientists are technical and not emotionally driven is a harmful stereotype.  People are diverse, and these fields are not mutually exclusive in personality types.
* **Small sample size:** The study only includes 100 professors, which is not necessarily representative of all computer science and humanities professors.
* **Base rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science (75%) and 25 are in humanities (25%).  Without any strong indicators from the description, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains higher.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability is based on the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75 or 75%. However, since the prompt specifically asks for a probability between 0 and 1, the answer is 0.25.**
