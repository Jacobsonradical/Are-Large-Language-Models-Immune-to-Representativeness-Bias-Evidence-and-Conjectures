{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indicators of his field of study (computer science or humanities). 

Here's why I chose 0.25:

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75/100 = 0.75 chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science and a 25/100 = 0.25 chance they are in humanities.
* **Description Neutrality:** The description highlights traits like creativity, imagination, and a passion for travel and reading. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **Lack of Technical Mention:** The phrase "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However,  it's not definitive. Many successful academics in various fields might not consider themselves highly technical.

**Therefore, without strong evidence pointing towards either field, the probability should remain close to the base rate for humanities professors, which is 0.25.**
