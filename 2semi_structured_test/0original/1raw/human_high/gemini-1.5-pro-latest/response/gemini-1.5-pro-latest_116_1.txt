**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a randomly selected professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities (25/100 = 0.25).  

The description of Jason leans towards traits often associated with humanities, but that's subjective.  **The key is that the description provides no concrete information to make us favor computer science over the base rate probability established by the sample composition.** 
 
Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.
