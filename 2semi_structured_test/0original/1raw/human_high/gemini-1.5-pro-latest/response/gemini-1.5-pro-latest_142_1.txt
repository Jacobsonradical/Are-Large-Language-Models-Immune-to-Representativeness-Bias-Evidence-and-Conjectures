**Explanation:**

Given the information provided, there's no strong reason to believe Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **The description is personality-focused:** The description emphasizes Jason's creativity, emotional drive, and enjoyment of travel, reading, and exploring. These traits are not exclusive to either computer science or humanities. 
* **Lack of technical emphasis:** The description notes Jason is "not particularly technical." While this might suggest a lower likelihood of being in computer science, it's not definitive. There are many areas within computer science where a highly technical focus isn't the primary need (e.g., more theoretical or design-oriented fields).

**Therefore, we fall back on the base rates provided in the study:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
* 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities (25%)

Since the personality description doesn't provide strong evidence to sway us from the base rates, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is **0.75**. 

**Important Note:** This assumes the personality description was chosen randomly and doesn't inherently provide information that would make it more likely to be associated with either field.
