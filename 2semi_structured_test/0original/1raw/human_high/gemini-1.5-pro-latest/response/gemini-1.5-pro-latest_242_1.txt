{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information directly relevant to his field of study. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly selected professor being in computer science.
* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these traits are not exclusive to humanities and can be found in individuals across various fields. 
* **Lack of "Technical" Emphasis:** The statement "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is a single data point and doesn't preclude Jason from being a brilliant, perhaps more theoretical, computer scientist.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information. While the description leans towards a stereotypical humanities professor, it's not definitive.  The probability of 0.25 reflects the smaller proportion of humanities professors in the sample while acknowledging the possibility that Jason could still be in computer science.
