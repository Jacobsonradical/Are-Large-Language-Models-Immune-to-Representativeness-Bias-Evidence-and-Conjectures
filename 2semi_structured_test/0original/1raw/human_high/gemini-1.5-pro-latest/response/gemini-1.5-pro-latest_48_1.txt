{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a 25% chance of Jason being a humanities professor (25/100 = 0.25).  

The provided description includes traits that could be found in academics of any field.  While it mentions Jason is "not particularly technical," this doesn't definitively rule him out as a computer science professor.  People in technical fields can still be creative, imaginative, and drawn to non-technical pursuits. 

Without stronger indicators linked to either field, the base rate of 25% for humanities professors is the most logical probability.
