{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either field. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Traits like "creative," "imaginative," and "emotionally driven" are often stereotypically associated with humanities, but they are not exclusive to the field. Computer science, especially in areas like AI and human-computer interaction, requires significant creativity and imagination. 
* **Small Sample Size:** The study has a relatively small sample size (100 professors), and with a 75/25 split between computer science and humanities, there's already a lower baseline chance of any randomly selected professor being from the humanities.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate from the study, which is 25%.**
