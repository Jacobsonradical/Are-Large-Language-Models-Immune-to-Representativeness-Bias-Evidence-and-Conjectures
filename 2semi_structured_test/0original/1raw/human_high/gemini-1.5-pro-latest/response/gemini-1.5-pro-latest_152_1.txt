**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession that would allow us to infer his field of study.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rate information provided:

* There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
* There are 25 humanities professors in the sample. 

This means there's a 75/100 = 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.  However, since we're given a description that could apply to someone in either field, we should treat the probability as if we're picking a professor at random from the entire sample.
