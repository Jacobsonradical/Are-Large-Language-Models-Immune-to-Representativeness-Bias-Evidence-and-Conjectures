{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability that any given professor is in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. However, the description of Jason doesn't strongly suggest a particular field.  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "not particularly technical" could apply to professors in either field. 

Therefore, I've adjusted the probability slightly downwards from the baseline of 0.75 to account for the description. It's a small adjustment because the description could easily fit a computer science professor interested in areas like human-computer interaction or computer graphics, which often attract individuals with those traits.
