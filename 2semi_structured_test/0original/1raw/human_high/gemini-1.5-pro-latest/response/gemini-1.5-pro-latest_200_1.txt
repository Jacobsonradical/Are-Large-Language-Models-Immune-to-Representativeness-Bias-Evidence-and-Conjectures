{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing directly indicating he's more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or creative, but this is a harmful stereotype. Many successful individuals in technical fields are deeply creative and passionate.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some slight personality trends within the study, a sample size of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors is relatively small to draw strong conclusions. 

**Since we lack strong evidence, the safest assumption is that Jason has an equal chance of being in either field.**  Given the study's composition (75 computer science, 25 humanities), there's a 25% probability he's a computer science professor.
