{"probability": "0.25"} 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Base Rate:** The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science (75/100 = 0.75). This is our starting point.

* **Description Analysis:** The description emphasizes Jason's creativity, emotional drive, and non-technical nature. While these traits are not exclusive to humanities, they might be slightly more stereotypical of someone in a field where emotional intelligence and creative expression are highly valued. 

* **Weak Evidence:**  The description doesn't provide strong evidence to drastically shift our probability from the base rate. It's entirely possible for a computer science professor to be creative, emotionally driven, and less technically focused (perhaps specializing in areas like human-computer interaction or computer graphics).

* **Adjusting from the Base Rate:** Given the slight lean towards humanities stereotypes in the description, I would slightly decrease the probability from the base rate of 0.75. However, it's important not to overemphasize the limited information.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.25, while not definitive, seems like a reasonable adjustment considering the information provided.**
