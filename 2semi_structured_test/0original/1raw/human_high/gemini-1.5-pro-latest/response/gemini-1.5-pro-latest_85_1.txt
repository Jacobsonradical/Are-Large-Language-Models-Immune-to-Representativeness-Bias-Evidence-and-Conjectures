{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a randomly selected professor has a 25% chance of being in the humanities.  

The description provided leans towards stereotypes sometimes associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical). However, these stereotypes are not reliable indicators of someone's profession. 

**It's crucial to avoid bias:**  We should not let the description influence us beyond the base rate probability.  Without more concrete information, the chance of Jason being in computer science is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.
