{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing that strongly indicates he's a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming computer scientists are less emotionally driven or creative. This is a harmful stereotype. 
* **Humanities professors can be technical:**  Fields like digital humanities require strong technical skills.
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor is the base rate. There were 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25) in the study.  This means there's a higher prior probability that a randomly selected professor would be from computer science.

**Therefore, without any strong indicators in the description, the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor simply due to the higher proportion of computer science professors in the sample.** 

However, a 0.25 probability still acknowledges there's a significant chance he could be in the humanities.
