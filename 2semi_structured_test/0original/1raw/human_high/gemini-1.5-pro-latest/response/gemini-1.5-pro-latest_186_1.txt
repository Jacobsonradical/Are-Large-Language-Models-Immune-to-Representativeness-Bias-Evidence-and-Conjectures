{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** We should avoid relying on stereotypes about computer science professors being less emotionally driven or creative.  
* **Description is balanced:** The description balances "creative and imaginative" with "not particularly technical," making it hard to lean heavily one way or the other.

Given the limited information and the importance of avoiding stereotypes, the safest estimate is to rely on the base rate provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science. 
* This represents a 75% probability (or 0.75).

However, we're asked for the probability given that we know *something* about Jason.  While the information isn't strongly suggestive either way, it does introduce some possibility that he fits a more stereotypical "humanities" profile.  Therefore, it's reasonable to adjust our probability slightly downwards from the base rate.

**A probability of 0.25 acknowledges the base rate favoring computer science while still reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the description.**
