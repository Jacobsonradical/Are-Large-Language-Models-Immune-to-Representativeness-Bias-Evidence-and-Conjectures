**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators to definitively place him in either computer science or humanities. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" are often associated with humanities, but they can be found in computer science professionals as well. Many areas within computer science, like AI or human-computer interaction, require high levels of creativity. 
* **The description is vague:** It doesn't mention anything about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or specific skills, which would be more informative.

**Therefore, without stronger evidence, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

* **75 out of 100** professors are in computer science.
* This translates to a **75% or 0.75 probability**.

However, since Jason is described as "not particularly technical", it suggests a slightly lower likelihood of him being in computer science.  To account for this, the probability is adjusted downwards slightly to **0.25**. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes. This answer is based on limited information and the provided context of the study.
