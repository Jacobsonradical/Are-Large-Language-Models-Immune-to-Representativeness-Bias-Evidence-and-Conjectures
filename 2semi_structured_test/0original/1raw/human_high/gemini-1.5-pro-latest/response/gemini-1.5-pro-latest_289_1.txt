{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the prior probability of any given professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. 

However, the description of Jason leans towards personality traits often associated with humanities:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"emotionally driven"** are more commonly linked to fields like literature, arts, or philosophy. 
* **"Not particularly technical"** further weakens the association with computer science.

While it's entirely possible for a computer scientist to be creative and not highly technical (perhaps focusing on theoretical aspects), the description makes it more likely Jason belongs to the humanities group. 

Therefore, the probability is significantly lower than the baseline 0.75, but not so low as to be near 0.  A probability of 0.25 reflects this.
