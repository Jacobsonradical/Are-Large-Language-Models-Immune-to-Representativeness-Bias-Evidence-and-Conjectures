{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to associate traits like "technical" with computer science, but these are stereotypes and not reliable for predicting someone's profession. 
* **Humanities can be creative and passionate:**  Fields like literature, philosophy, and history require immense creativity, passion, and exploration â€“ traits Jason clearly possesses.
* **The base rate is important:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of computer science professors in the sample. Without strong evidence pointing towards humanities, the base rate should heavily influence the probability.

**Therefore, while it's impossible to be certain, a probability of 0.25 (the base rate for humanities professors) is a reasonable estimate.**
