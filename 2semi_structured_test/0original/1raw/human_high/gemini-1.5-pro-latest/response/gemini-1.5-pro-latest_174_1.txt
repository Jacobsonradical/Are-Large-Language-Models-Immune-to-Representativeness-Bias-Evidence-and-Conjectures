{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that specifically relates to his field of study. Therefore, we should rely on the base rate provided in the study's description:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there is a 75% (or 0.75) chance a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.

However, we are also told that Jason is "not particularly technical." While this doesn't rule out him being a computer science professor, it slightly lowers the probability.  

Since we don't have concrete data on how much "not particularly technical" impacts the likelihood, we need to make a subjective adjustment.  

Given the limited information, a reasonable adjustment might be to reduce the probability from 0.75 to **0.25**. 

**Important Note:** This is a highly subjective estimation. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on the field of humanities Jason specializes in and other factors.
