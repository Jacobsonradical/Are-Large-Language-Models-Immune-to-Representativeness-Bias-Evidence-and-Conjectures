{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Assuming traits like "creative" or "not particularly technical" automatically align with one field is biased and inaccurate. Both fields require creativity, and technical skill levels vary within each.
* **Sample size matters:**  The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, making it inherently more likely that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. 

**Therefore, without any specific information linking Jason's traits to either field, the prior probability based purely on the sample size is the most logical choice.**
