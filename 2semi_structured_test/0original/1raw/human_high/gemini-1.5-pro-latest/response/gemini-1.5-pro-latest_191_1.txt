**Reasoning:**

There is a higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample (75 vs. 25). However, the description of Jason leans towards traits more stereotypically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, not particularly technical). 

While these traits don't preclude him from being in computer science, they weaken the likelihood. Therefore, the probability should be lower than the base rate for computer science professors (0.75) but not extremely low. A probability of 0.25 seems reasonable. 

**Important Note:** This is based on stereotypes and limited information. It's crucial to avoid such biased thinking in real-life situations.  Personality traits are not reliable indicators of professional fields.
