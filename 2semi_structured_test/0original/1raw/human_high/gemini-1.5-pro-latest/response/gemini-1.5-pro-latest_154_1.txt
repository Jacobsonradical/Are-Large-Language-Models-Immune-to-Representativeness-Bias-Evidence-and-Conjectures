**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little information directly relevant to his field of study. 

Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science.
* **Stereotypes Aren't Reliable:** The description plays into some potential stereotypes about humanities professors (creative, imaginative, enjoys reading). However, these traits are not exclusive to the humanities and can be found in many computer science professors as well. 
* **Lack of "Technical" Emphasis:**  The phrase "though not particularly technical" might suggest a bias against computer science. However, this is a single data point and could be easily countered by other aspects of his personality or work not mentioned.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid relying heavily on stereotypes.  A strong probability estimate would require more information about how these personality traits actually correlate with academic field in the study data.
