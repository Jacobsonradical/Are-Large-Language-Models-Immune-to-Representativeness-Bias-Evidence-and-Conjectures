**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct clues about his field of study. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be emotionally driven or enjoy creative pursuits plays into harmful stereotypes.  
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:** "Humanities" is a broad category. A professor of literature might fit the description, but so might a professor of digital art or music, fields that intersect with technology.

**The key is the sample size:**

* The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
* This means there's a **3:1 ratio**, making it **three times more likely** that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.

**Therefore, without any strong indicators from the description, the probability should reflect the baseline likelihood based purely on the sample composition.**
