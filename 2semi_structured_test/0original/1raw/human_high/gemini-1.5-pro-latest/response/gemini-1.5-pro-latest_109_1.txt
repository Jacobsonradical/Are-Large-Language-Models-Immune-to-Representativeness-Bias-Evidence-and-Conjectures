{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in the description about Jason's profession or field of study. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

This means there's a **75% chance** a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science and a **25% chance** they are in the humanities. 

Since the description provides no information to suggest Jason is more likely to be in one field over the other, the probability he's a computer science professor is simply the base rate for computer science professors in the study.
