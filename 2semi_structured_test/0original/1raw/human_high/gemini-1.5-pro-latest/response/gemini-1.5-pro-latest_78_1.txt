**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we should rely solely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

Since 25% of the professors are in the humanities and 75% are in computer science, there is a 25% probability that Jason is a humanities professor and a 75% probability he is a computer science professor.
