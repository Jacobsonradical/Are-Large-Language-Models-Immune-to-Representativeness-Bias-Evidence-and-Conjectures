{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct indication of his field of study. 

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** Traits like "creative", "imaginative", and "passionate" are often associated with humanities, but can be found in individuals across all disciplines, including computer science. 
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, making it statistically more likely that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

**Therefore, without any strong indicators towards either field, the probability leans towards the larger group, which is the computer science professors. A probability of 0.25 (representing the base chance based on sample sizes alone) is a reasonable estimate.**
