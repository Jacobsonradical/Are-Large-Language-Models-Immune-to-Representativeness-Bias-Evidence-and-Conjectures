**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, there's nothing definitively pointing towards him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming all computer science professors are technical and less emotionally driven is a harmful stereotype.  
* **Humanities professors can be technical:** Fields like digital humanities require strong technical skills. 
* **Personality traits are diverse:**  Successful academics in any field can be creative, imaginative, and passionate. 

The description leans slightly towards humanities due to the mention of  "not particularly technical," but this is not a strong indicator.  

**Therefore, with no strong evidence, a probability slightly favoring humanities (due to the one phrase) seems appropriate. A probability of 0.3 reflects this slight lean.**
