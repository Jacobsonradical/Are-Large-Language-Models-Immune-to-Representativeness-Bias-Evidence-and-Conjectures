{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is a simple base rate to consider here. 25% of the professors in the study are from the humanities (25 out of 100).  We have no other information about Jason other than the description, which doesn't strongly suggest a computer science background. Therefore, the best initial estimate of the probability is the base rate of humanities professors in the study. 

**Important Note:**  The description might lead to some assumptions about personality types and their fit with certain fields. However, it's crucial to avoid stereotyping. The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to deviate significantly from the base rate.
