{"probability": "0.1"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's nothing in the description that definitively rules out Jason being a computer science professor, the description leans towards traits often associated with humanities fields:

* **"Creative and imaginative"** and **"emotionally driven"** are often associated with artistic and humanistic pursuits.
* **"Not particularly technical"** makes it slightly less likely he's in a highly technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes. There are many creative and emotionally driven computer scientists, and many humanities professors who are highly technical!  The relatively small sample size of the study also limits the strength of any conclusions.
