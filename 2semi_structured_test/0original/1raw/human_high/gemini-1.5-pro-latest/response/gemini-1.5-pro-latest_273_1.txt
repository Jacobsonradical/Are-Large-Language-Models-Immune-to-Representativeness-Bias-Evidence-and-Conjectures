{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** It's easy to fall into the trap of stereotyping computer science professors as less creative or emotionally driven. However, this is a harmful generalization. 
* **Humanities are Broad:** The humanities encompass a wide range of fields (literature, history, philosophy, etc.), some of which could easily attract someone with Jason's described traits.
* **Sample Size:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75/100 = 0.75) that any randomly selected professor from this study is from computer science.

**Why 0.25?**

Without strong evidence pointing towards either field, the most logical approach is to slightly lean towards the smaller group (humanities professors) since the description doesn't strongly align with common stereotypes of computer science professors.  A probability of 0.25 represents a lower likelihood than chance (0.5), but not an extremely low probability like 0.1.
