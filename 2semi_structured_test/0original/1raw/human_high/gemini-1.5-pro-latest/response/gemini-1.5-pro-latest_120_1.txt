{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information directly relevant to his field of study. 

* **Base Rate:** The most crucial piece of information is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in humanities. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
* **Description:** The description leans towards traits often associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading). However, these traits are not exclusive to humanities and can be found in individuals across various fields. 
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:**  The description lacks strong indicators for computer science (e.g., analytical, detail-oriented, logic-driven) or strong indicators against it (e.g., dislikes technology).

**Conclusion:** 

Given the lack of strong indicators and the higher base rate for computer science professors, it's more likely that Jason belongs to the larger group.  However, the description leans slightly towards humanities. Therefore, a probability slightly lower than the base rate of 0.75, such as **0.25**, seems appropriate.
