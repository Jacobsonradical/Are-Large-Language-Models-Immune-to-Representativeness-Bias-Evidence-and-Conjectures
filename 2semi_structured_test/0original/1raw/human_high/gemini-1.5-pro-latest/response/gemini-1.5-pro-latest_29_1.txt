**Explanation:**

There is no information in the description of Jason that is particularly indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Since the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a 75/100 = 0.75 probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science and a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that they are in the humanities.

Given the lack of information in the description, we should rely on the base rate from the sample.
