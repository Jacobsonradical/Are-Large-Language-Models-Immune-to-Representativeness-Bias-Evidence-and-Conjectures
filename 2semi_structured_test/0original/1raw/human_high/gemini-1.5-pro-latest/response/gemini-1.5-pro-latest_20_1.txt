{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his field. Here's why I lean towards a lower probability:

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly selected professor being in computer science.
* **Description Ambiguity:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a non-technical nature.  These traits are not exclusive to humanities but are less stereotypical of computer scientists.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. The description alone doesn't definitively place Jason in either field.
