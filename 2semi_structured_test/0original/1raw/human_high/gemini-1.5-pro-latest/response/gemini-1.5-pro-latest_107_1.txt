{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality, it offers little to no direct correlation to his field of study (computer science or humanities). 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming traits like "creative" or "not particularly technical" make someone more likely to be in the humanities plays into stereotypes about both fields. Many computer scientists are highly creative, and many humanities scholars are incredibly detail-oriented and analytical.
* **Sample size matters:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, making it statistically more likely that a randomly chosen professor from the study is in computer science.

**Therefore, without any information directly linking Jason's personality to his field, the probability is simply based on the sample proportions:**

* 25 humanities professors / 100 total professors = 0.25 probability 
* 75 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75 probability
