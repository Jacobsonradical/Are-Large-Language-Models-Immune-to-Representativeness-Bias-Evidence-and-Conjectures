{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into his field of study. 

* **Lack of Technical Descriptors:** The description explicitly mentions Jason is "not particularly technical."  While this might suggest he's less likely to be in a technical field like computer science, it's not definitive.
* **Humanities Stereotypes:**  Words like "creative," "imaginative," and "emotionally driven" might seem stereotypically aligned with humanities fields. However, these traits are not exclusive to the humanities. 
* **Base Rate:** The most crucial factor is the base rate. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science, meaning there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.

**Therefore, without strong evidence suggesting otherwise, the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor simply due to the higher representation of computer science professors in the sample.**

**Important Note:** Stereotypes should never be the sole basis for judging someone's profession. This answer is based on a probabilistic analysis given limited information.
