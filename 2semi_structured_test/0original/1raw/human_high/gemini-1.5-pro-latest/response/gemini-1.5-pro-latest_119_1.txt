{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is no information in Jason's description that is particularly indicative of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 75 out of 100 professors in the study are computer science professors.
* This translates to a 75% (or 0.75) probability of any random professor from the study being a computer science professor.

However, the prompt asks for the probability *given* that the description was chosen randomly from 100 available descriptions. Since we have no information connecting the description to a specific field, each of the 100 descriptions has an equal chance of being selected. 

Therefore, the probability of the randomly chosen description belonging to a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is **0.25** or 25%.
