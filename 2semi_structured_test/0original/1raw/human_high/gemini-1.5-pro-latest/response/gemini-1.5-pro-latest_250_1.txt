**Reasoning:**

The description provides some potential hints, but ultimately not enough to strongly suggest Jason is a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes vs. Reality:**  While "technical" might seem to favor computer science, it's a stereotypical association. Many successful academics in humanities fields are highly technical within their own disciplines (think of linguists, historians using complex data analysis, etc.). 
* **Small Sample Size:**  75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors is a relatively small sample. It's not enough to draw strong conclusions about personality types dominating either field.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality is complex. Even within a field like computer science, there's a wide spectrum of personalities. 

**Why 0.2 (20%)?**

Since the sample has 75 computer science professors out of 100, the base probability is 0.75. However, the description doesn't strongly support a computer science leaning. Therefore, I've adjusted the probability downwards, but not drastically, as the information is insufficient to make a strong judgment.
