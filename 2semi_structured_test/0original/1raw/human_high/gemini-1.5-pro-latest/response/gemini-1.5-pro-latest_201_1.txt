{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 75/100 or 0.75. However, the description leans slightly away from a typical computer science stereotype by highlighting "not particularly technical." This pushes the probability slightly downwards. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.25 acknowledges the base rate while incorporating the slightly contradicting information.  It's important to note that this is a highly subjective estimate based on limited information.
