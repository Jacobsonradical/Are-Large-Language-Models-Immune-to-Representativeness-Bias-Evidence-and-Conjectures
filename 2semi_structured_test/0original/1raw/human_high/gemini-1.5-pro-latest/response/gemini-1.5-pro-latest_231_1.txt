{"probability": "0.3"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why I lean slightly towards him not being a computer science professor:

* **"Not particularly technical"**: This phrase suggests Jason might not excel in a field heavily reliant on technical skills like computer science.
* **Creative and imaginative, emotionally driven**: These traits, while present in many professions, are often associated with fields in the humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The sample size is relatively small.
* **Base Rate:** There's a higher base rate of computer science professors (75%) in the study sample than humanities professors (25%). 
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to avoid stereotyping based on limited personality descriptions. Many computer scientists are creative and emotionally driven, and many humanities scholars are highly technical.

**Conclusion:**

The probability of 0.3 reflects a slight leaning towards Jason being in the humanities due to the "not particularly technical" statement. However, it's important to emphasize this is a very weak prediction based on limited information.
