{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  Assuming all computer scientists are technical and less emotionally driven is a stereotype. Many computer scientists are creative, imaginative, and passionate.
* **Humanities encompass diverse fields:**  The term "humanities" is broad, covering fields like literature, philosophy, history, and languages.  Jason's traits could fit a professor in any of these areas. 

**The Base Rate:**

Since the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate (prior probability) of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

**Lack of Strong Evidence:**

The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly shift our probability away from the base rate. While the "not particularly technical" comment might slightly decrease the likelihood of Jason being a computer scientist, it's not definitive.

**Therefore:**

A probability of 0.25 reflects the lack of strong indicators in the description. It acknowledges the higher base rate for computer science professors but doesn't completely disregard the possibility that Jason might be in the humanities.
