**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators.
* **Humanities can be technical:**  Fields like digital humanities or computational linguistics require strong technical skills.

**Since we lack strong evidence, we default to the base rate:**

* 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science.
* This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* However, the description focuses on one individual, not the entire group.

**To avoid overconfidence, we adjust slightly downwards:** A probability of 0.25 acknowledges the uncertainty while still leaning towards the higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
