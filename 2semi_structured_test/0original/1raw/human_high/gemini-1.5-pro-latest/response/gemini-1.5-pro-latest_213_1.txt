{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information in the description that clearly points towards Jason being in computer science or humanities, we have to rely on the base rates provided in the study. 

* 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science.
* 25 out of 100 professors were from humanities.

Therefore, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75, and the prior probability of them being in humanities is 25/100 = 0.25.

**Without any further information about Jason's personality traits related to his field**, the best estimate of the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the base rate for computer science professors in the study.
