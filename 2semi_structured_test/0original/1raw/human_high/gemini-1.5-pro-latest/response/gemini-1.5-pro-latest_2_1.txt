{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it lacks strong indicators of his field of study. Here's why I chose a probability close to the base rate:

* **Base Rate:** With 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. 
* **Description Ambiguity:** The description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a non-technical nature. These traits are not exclusive to either field. While they might be perceived as more common in humanities, many computer scientists, especially in areas like AI or human-computer interaction, possess these qualities.  
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:**  There's no mention of specific research interests, teaching styles, or other clues that would strongly suggest one field over the other.

**Therefore, without further information, a probability close to the base rate of 0.75 (computer science) is more appropriate than a probability heavily skewed towards either field.**  However, since the description slightly leans towards stereotypical humanities traits, I've adjusted the probability slightly downwards to 0.25.
