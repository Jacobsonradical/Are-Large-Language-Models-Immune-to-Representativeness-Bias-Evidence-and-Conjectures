{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some insights into Jason's personality, it provides little information directly relevant to his field of study. The traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) could be found in professors from various disciplines. 

Since the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. However, the description doesn't offer strong evidence to shift this probability significantly. 

The phrase "not particularly technical" might slightly decrease the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, but it's not definitive. Many successful computer science academics might not consider themselves exceptionally technical compared to their peers or might excel in areas that don't emphasize technical skills as much (like theoretical computer science or human-computer interaction).

Therefore, a probability of 0.25, while acknowledging the slight nudge towards humanities due to the "not particularly technical" comment, recognizes that the description doesn't provide enough information for a confident prediction in either direction.
