**Reasoning:**

Since there is no information about Jason's personality traits being more common in either computer science or humanities, we can only rely on the base rate provided in the initial description. 

* There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. 
* This means 75% of the professors in the study were from computer science, and 25% were from humanities. 

Therefore, without any further information about Jason's personality influencing his field, the probability of him being a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the study, which is 25%.
