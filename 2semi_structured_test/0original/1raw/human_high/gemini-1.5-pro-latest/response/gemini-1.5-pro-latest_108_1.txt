{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers little insight into whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to associate traits like "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes that may not hold true for all individuals. 
* **Humanities can be creative and innovative:**  Fields within the humanities, like digital art or computational linguistics, often require creativity and technical skills.
* **Small sample size:** The study only includes 100 professors, which is a relatively small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields.

**Given the lack of information directly related to Jason's profession, the most logical approach is to rely on the base rate:**

* 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* This means there's a 75% (or 0.75) chance a randomly chosen professor is in computer science. 

**However, the prompt asks for the probability specifically for Jason, who is described as "not particularly technical."**  This information, while vague, suggests a slightly lower probability than the base rate. 

Therefore, a probability of **0.25**, while somewhat arbitrary, acknowledges the slight evidence against Jason being a computer science professor due to the "not particularly technical" descriptor, while still recognizing the limited information available.
