{"probability": "0.25"} 

**Reasoning:**

Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.  

However, the description of Jason doesn't strongly suggest either field. The phrases "not particularly technical" might slightly decrease the probability of him being a computer science professor, while  "creative and imaginative" might slightly increase it. 

Given the lack of strong signals either way, I'm reducing the probability slightly from the base rate of 0.75 down to 0.25. This is a subjective adjustment based on the limited information provided.
