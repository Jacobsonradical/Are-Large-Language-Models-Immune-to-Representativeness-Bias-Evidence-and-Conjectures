**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it offers no strong indicators of whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** It's tempting to assume computer science professors are less emotionally driven or less interested in travel and reading. However, these are stereotypes and not reliable indicators.
* **Description is vague:** The description is general and could apply to professors in various fields.  
* **Base Rate:** The most important factor here is the base rate. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, or a 75% chance that a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.

**Since the description doesn't provide strong evidence to override the base rate, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.75. However, the question asks for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors *in the sample*. There are 25 computer science professors in the sample, and 100 professors total. Therefore, the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.**
