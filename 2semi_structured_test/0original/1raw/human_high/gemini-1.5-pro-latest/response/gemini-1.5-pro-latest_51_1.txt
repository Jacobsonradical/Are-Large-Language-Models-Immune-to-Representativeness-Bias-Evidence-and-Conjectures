{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some insights into Jason's personality, it offers little to no information relevant to his field of study. 

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** We might be tempted to associate traits like "technical" with computer science. However, this relies on stereotypes and doesn't consider the diverse range of personalities within any academic field.
* **Base rate is crucial:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, or a 75% chance that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.

**Therefore, without any information directly related to Jason's academic field, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be based on the base rate from the study, which is 0.75 or 75%.  Since I can only provide a number between 0 and 1, the answer is 0.75.**
