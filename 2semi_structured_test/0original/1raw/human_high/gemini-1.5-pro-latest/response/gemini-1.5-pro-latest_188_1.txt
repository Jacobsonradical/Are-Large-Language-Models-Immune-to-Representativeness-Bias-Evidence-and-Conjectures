{"probability": "0.25"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information about Jason, it lacks strong indicators of his profession.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be emotionally driven or enjoy travel/reading is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Humanities is broad:**  "Humanities" encompasses diverse fields (literature, history, philosophy, etc.).  Jason's description could fit many professions within or outside academia.
* **Sample Size Matters:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  This means there's a higher baseline chance (75%) of any randomly selected professor being from computer science.

**Therefore:**

Without stronger evidence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best represented by the base proportion in the study sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75. Since we are looking for the probability of him being in the smaller group (25 humanities professors out of 100), the probability is 25/100 = 0.25.
