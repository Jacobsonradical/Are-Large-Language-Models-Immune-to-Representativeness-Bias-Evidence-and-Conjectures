Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors. This scenario is essentially a problem of Bayesian inference.

We know the following:
- 25% of the total professors are in computer science (25 out of 100).
- 75% of the total professors are in the humanities (75 out of 100).

Based on Jason's description:
- He enjoys coding (more common among computer science professors).
- He enjoys solving mathematical puzzles (also more common in computer science).
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing (activities often more associated with the humanities).

Let's outline the basic prior probabilities:
- Probability of being in computer science (P(CS)) = 0.25
- Probability of being in the humanities (P(H)) = 0.75

Given his hobbies and interests, these are strong indicators that Jason might belong to the computer science group. However, to compute an exact probability, we would normally need the likelihood values, i.e., the probability of enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing given that one is a professor in either field. But since we don't have those precise likelihoods, let's reasonably assume that the likelihood of Jason's profile fitting a computer science professor is much higher than fitting a humanities professor.

Thus, we can intuitively adjust our prior probability towards computer science. Given the stronger indicator of computer science traits in Jason's profile, we can
