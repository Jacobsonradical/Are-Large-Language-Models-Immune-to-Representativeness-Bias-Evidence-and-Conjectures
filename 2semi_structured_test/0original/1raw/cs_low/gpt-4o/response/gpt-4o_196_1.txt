To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which combines prior probabilities with new evidence.

First, let’s set up the information:
- Prior probability (base rate) that a professor is in computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability (base rate) that a professor is in the humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, given Jason's description—conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing—it seems more likely these traits fit someone in computer science over humanities due to the mentioning of coding and mathematical puzzles, which are more aligned with computer science.

We need to estimate how likely any given description from each group fits Jason’s profile:
- Probability of Jason’s profile given he is a computer science professor: Let’s denote it as \( P(Jason|CS) \)
- Probability of Jason’s profile given he is a humanities professor: Let’s denote it as \( P(Jason|H) \)

Without explicit numerical values, we can assume:
- \( P(Jason|CS) \) is high (because coding and mathematical puzzles are primary indicators)
- \( P(Jason|H) \) is low (because those traits are less common and not directly related to humanities roles)

Let’s denote
