{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: In the provided description, Jason has a strong inclination toward activities and traits that seem more aligned with computer science, such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being highly creative without a preference for drawing or writing. Given that there are more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25) in the sample, we need to balance the categorical tendencies with the base rates (proportions) of the professors.

However, Jason's interests and traits are more stereotypically aligned with computer science professors. If we were to rely solely on the description, we might lean heavily toward the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Given these considerations, the 0.75 probability strikes a balance between the base rates and the descriptive specificity.
