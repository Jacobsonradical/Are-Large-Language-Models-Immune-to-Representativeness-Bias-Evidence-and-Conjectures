Given the description and the base rates of computer science professors (25 out of 100) and humanities professors (75 out of 100), we need to consider both the base rates and how well Jason's description fits typical characteristics of professors in these fields.

Firstly, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate Proportion):**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(Hum)): 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood of the Description (Based on Jason's Traits):**
   - Jason's interests such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with computer science.
   - Traits like not enjoying drawing or writing are more aligned with someone outside the humanities, which often involves significant writing and creative processes like drawing.

Given these traits, Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Assuming that the description strongly suggests a computer science professor, we might estimate:

- Likelihood of the
