Based on the provided description, several characteristics suggest that Jason is more likely to be one of the computer science professors. Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his limited interest in drawing or writing, aligns more closely with the typical profile of someone in the computer science field compared to the humanities.

However, it is essential to consider the base rates: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability more formally.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the detailed description provided.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor)
- \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)

Assuming the description aligns more with a computer science profile, we can make a
