To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D | H) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To use Bayes' theorem, we need to find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description occurring:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now we calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since the description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (activities more common among computer science professors), we might assume that:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low as
