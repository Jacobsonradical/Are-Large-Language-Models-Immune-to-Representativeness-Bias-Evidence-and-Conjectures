Given the information about the study's sample sizes and the description of Jason, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | HUM) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(HUM) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now we need to assess \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HUM
