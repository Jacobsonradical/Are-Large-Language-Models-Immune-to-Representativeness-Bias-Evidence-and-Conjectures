To determine the probability, we need to consider how likely it is that Jason is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. We'll use a form of Bayes' Theorem for this calculation, which allows us to update our probability given new information.

Let's break down the components:
1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(Humanities)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(description | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(description | Humanities) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

For this example, given Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing, it's reasonable to assume that \( P(description | CS) \) is higher than \( P(description | Humanities) \). However, without exact numbers, we make a qualitative assessment:

Let's assume:

- \( P(description | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(description | Humanities) = 0.1 \)

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS | description) \):

\[ P(CS |
