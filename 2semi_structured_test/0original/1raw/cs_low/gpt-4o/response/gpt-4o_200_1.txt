To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let’s set up the known quantities:

- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

We are given a description of Jason which suggests he enjoys activities typically associated with computer science. We need to calculate:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | Humanities) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have detailed probabilities for the description given each field, we’ll assume the description fits a computer science professor much better than a humanities professor based on the given interests and activities (coding, puzzles, and jogging).
