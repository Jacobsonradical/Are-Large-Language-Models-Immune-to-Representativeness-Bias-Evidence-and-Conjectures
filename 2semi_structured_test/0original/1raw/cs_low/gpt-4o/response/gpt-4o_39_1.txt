{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors due to several factors such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely aligned with typical interests and skills in the field of computer science. Moreover, despite the differences in the sample sizes (25 in computer science vs. 75 in the humanities), the specific personality traits and hobbies described tilt the probability towards him being a computer science professor. Taking both the sample sizes and the descriptive matching into account, the probability is estimated at 0.75.
