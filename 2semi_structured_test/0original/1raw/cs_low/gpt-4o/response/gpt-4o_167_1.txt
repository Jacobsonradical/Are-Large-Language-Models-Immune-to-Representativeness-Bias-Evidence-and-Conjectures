{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimation is based on the observation that Jason's interests and traits align more closely with those commonly found in computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) as opposed to humanities professors (drawing or writing). Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, but Jason's description is more typical of a computer science professor, an estimate of 0.75 appears reasonable. However, it is also informed by considering both the baseline probabilities (prior distribution) and the evidence presented.
