To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. Here's the relevant information:

- Total number of professors: 100 (25 in computer science and 75 in humanities).
- We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem formula is: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let: 
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event of having Jason's description.

We need to determine:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he's a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason's description among all professors.

Given:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We also need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Given Jasonâ€™s interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these are more common traits for a computer science professor. We can assume \( P(B|
