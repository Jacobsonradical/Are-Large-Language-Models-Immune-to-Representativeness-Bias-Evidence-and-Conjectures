Given the description of Jason, it seems likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing, which are typically more associated with humanities professors.

To calculate the probability, we need to consider the total number of professors in each field and then assess how likely Jason's description matches each group.

- Total Number of Professors: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
- Prior Probability (before description) of being a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25
- Prior Probability of being a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75

Given the description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests a computer science background.
- Not enjoying drawing or writing further leans away from humanities.

Using Bayes’ Theorem conceptually:
1. Likelihood of Jason’s profile given he is a computer science professor \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is much higher than \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

While exact likelihood ratios aren't provided, we can reasonably infer that the description highly favors Jason being a computer science professor.

Based on this strong qualitative assessment, the updated (posterior) probability will be significantly more than the prior 0.25 but not absolute certainty.

Therefore, I
