Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, the probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- Similarly, the probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need the likelihoods, reflecting how likely it is that the given description matches a professor in each group:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypical interests for a computer science professor.
- Despite his creativity, he doesn’t enjoy drawing or writing, activities that might be more common among humanities professors.

Given these traits, the description seems more likely to fit a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We need to make a rough estimation of how much more likely:
- Let's assume that the probability of this description given that the professor is from computer science (\(P(description | CS)\)) is relatively high, say 0.9.
- Conversely, the probability of this description given that the professor is from the humanities (\(P(description | H)\)) might be lower, let’s estimate it at,
