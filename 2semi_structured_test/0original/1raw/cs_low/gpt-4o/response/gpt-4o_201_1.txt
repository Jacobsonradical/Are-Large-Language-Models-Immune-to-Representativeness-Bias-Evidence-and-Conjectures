{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on Bayesian reasoning and the specific interests and traits described in Jason's profile. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, aligns more closely with what might be expected in a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, as there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, the prior probability needs to be considered as well. Thus, taking into account both the base rates and the fit of the description, a reasonable probability estimate is 0.75.
