Given Jason's interests and personality traits, it is reasonable to assume he is more likely to be a computer science professor, given his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated with the field of computer science. However, we also need to consider the ratio of humanities professors to computer science professors in the sample, which is 75:25 or 3:1.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability more directly. Let \(A\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(B\) be the description fitting Jason's profile.

The prior probability \(P(A)\) is the initial probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Similarly, the prior probability \(P(A^c)\) of Jason being a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to compare the likelihood of having such a description given that Jason is a computer science professor \(P(B|A)\) versus him being a humanities professor \(P(B|A^c)\).

Assuming:
- \(P(B|A) = 1\) since the description strongly matches a computer science professor,
- \(P(B|A^c)\) would likely be much less since humanities professors are less likely to fit the description involving coding and mathematical puzzles.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) =
