To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with conditional probabilities.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Bayes' theorem formula in this context: 

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

While we do not have explicit values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we could estimate these based on the description. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 1 \), meaning that the
