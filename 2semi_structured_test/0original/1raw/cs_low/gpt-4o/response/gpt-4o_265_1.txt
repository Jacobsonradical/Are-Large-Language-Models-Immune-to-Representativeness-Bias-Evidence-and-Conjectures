Given the description and without additional specific data linking these traits more strongly to one profession over the other, the base rates can be utilized. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study, making the base rate probability:

- Probability of choosing a computer science professor (CS): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of choosing a humanities professor (Hum): 75/100 = 0.75

However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities that are more strongly associated with computer science, it suggests a higher likelihood that Jason might be a computer science professor. While precise Bayesian updating requires more detailed likelihood values, the substantial relevance of coding and mathematical puzzles to computer science cannot be ignored.

Considering this information, we can adjust the probability upwards from the base rate of 0.25.

Thus, a reasonable estimation might be around 0.85:

{"probability": "0.85"}
