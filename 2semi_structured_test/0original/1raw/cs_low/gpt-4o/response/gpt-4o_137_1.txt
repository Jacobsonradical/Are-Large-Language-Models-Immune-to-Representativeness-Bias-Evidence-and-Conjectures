{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate considers the background details and personality traits that align closely with commonly stereotyped attributes of computer science professionals, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Given that there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample (75) as computer science professors (25), the relatively high probability reflects the strong match of Jason's interests and traits with those typically associated with computer science rather than humanities professors.
