Based on the given description of Jason, several aspects suggest he might belong to the computer science group rather than the humanities group. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities typically associated with computer science. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities. Therefore, these traits align more closely with those expected of computer science professors.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of picking a computer science professor at random is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), while the probability of picking a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

However, based on Jason's description and the alignment of his interests and characteristics more with computer science, I would update my estimate to reflect the higher likelihood.

Letâ€™s assume that the description is significantly more likely if Jason is a computer science professor than if he is a humanities professor. This can be represented with a likelihood ratio, updating the prior probabilities.

So, given the description, my updated estimate for Jason being a computer science professor would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
