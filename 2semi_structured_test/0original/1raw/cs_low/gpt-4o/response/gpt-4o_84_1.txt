{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason's interests and traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely related to computer science, it is reasonable to infer that he is more likely to be one of the computer science professors. Assuming no particular weighting of traits across the two fields, and given the sample sizes with a ratio of 1:3 (25 computer science professors to 75 humanities professors), his strong affinity for activities commonly associated with computer science increases the likelihood that he fits within the smaller group of computer science professors. Thus, the estimated probability is adjusted to reflect this increased likelihood.
