To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates and the specific details provided in the description.

Base rate information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25, and the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Description details related to Jason:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles (more typical of a computer science professor).
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing (less typical of a humanities professor).

Given this information, it seems more likely that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science.

Based on the base rates and this description, we will apply Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \) be the evidence (Jason's description).

We are interested in \( P(A|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(B|E)
