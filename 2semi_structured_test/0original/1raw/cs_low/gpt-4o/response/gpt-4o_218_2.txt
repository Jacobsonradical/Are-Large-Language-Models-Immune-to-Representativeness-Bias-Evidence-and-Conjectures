To answer this question, we need to consider the base rates (or prior probabilities) of the two groups of professors, as well as the likelihood of the description fitting a professor from each group.

### Base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 25 + 75 = 100.
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25.
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75.

### Likelihoods:
- Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more typical of a computer science professor.
- Traits like being conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, and creative without an interest in drawing or writing also align more with a typical computer science professor profile.

Based on this information, the likelihood of Jason being in computer science seems higher than his likelihood of being in the humanities.

### Applying Bayes' theorem:
Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason having the given description.

We want \( P(CS|B) \).

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS|D
