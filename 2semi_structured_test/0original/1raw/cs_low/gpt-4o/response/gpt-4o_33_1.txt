To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which incorporates prior probabilities and likelihoods derived from given data.

Given Information:
- Jason is one of the 100 professors.
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description is more indicative of traits typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.).

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of this description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of getting this description overall.

Prior Probability (P(CS)):
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior Probability (P(Humanities)):
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We assess that the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) may be higher compared to \( P(\text
