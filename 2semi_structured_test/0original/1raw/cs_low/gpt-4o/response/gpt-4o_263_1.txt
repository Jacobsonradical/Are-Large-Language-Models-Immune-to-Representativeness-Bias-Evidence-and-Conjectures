{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given the description of Jason, his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the typical interests of computer science professors rather than humanities professors. Even though the sample size has more humanities professors (75 out of 100), the specific traits and interests provided suggest a stronger match with the computer science field. This leads to a higher estimated probability of 0.75 that Jason is a computer science professor despite the smaller group size.
