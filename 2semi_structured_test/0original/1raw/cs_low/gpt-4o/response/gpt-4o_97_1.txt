{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from considering both the base rates and the descriptive details. The base rate suggests that 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science, indicating an initial probability of 0.25. However, Jason's interests and traits—coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing—are more aligned with computer science than the humanities, suggesting a higher probability for a computer science professor. This increased alignment with the description adjusts the probability upward to 0.75.
