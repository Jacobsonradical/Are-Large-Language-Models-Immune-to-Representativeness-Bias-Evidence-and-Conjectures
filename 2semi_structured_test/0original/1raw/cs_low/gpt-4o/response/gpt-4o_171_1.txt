Based on the description provided, it seems that Jason exhibits characteristics and interests that align more closely with those typically associated with computer science professors—specifically, his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Bearing in mind that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\). However, given Jason’s coding interests, it is more likely he belongs to the smaller group of computer science professors.

Taking these factors into account, my revised probability estimate is:

{"probability": "0.8"}
