Given the information about the 100 professors, 25 are from computer science and 75 are from the humanities. This means that without any other information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.

However, the description of Jason seems to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor more closely than a humanities professor. To quantify this, we can consider how likely these traits are within each group, but without specific base rates for these traits in each field, we must rely on our priors.

Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume these traits are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. So, we update our probability upwards from the base rate of 0.25.

While we can't give a precise updated probability without more specific data, we can reasonably assume Jason's traits make him more likely to be one of the computer science professors. Assuming that these traits significantly increase the probability, let's say, they make Jason approximately 3 times more likely to be a computer science professor:

\[ \text{Updated probability} = \frac{3 \times 0.25}{(3 \times 0.25) + 0.75(1)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.75} = \frac{0.75}{1.5} = 0.5 \]

So
