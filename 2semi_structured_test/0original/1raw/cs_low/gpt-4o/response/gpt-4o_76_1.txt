To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \(P(CS)\): the prior probability that a professor is from the computer science cohort.
- \(P(H)\): the prior probability that a professor is from the humanities cohort.
- \(P(D|CS)\): the probability of the description given that the professor is from the computer science cohort.
- \(P(D|H)\): the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities cohort.

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) and \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

To determine \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), we need to make educated guesses based on the description:

- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seem more closely aligned with the profile of a computer science professor.
- Despite being highly creative, not enjoying drawing or writing may also align more with computer science.

Letâ€™s assume that these traits are more typical for a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We might estimate:

- \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0
