{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability estimate is based on Jason's interests and traits that align more closely with those typically associated with computer science, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, even though psychologists agree that people's interests do not strictly determine their professional field. However, given the base rate fallacy, I slightly adjusted the estimate taking into account the larger number of humanities professors in the sample.
