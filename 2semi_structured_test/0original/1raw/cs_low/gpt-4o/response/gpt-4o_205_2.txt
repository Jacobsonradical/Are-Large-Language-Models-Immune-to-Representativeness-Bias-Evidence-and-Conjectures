{"probability": "0.5"}

Given the description of Jason and the structure of the study, it is tempting to attribute his traits and interests more closely to a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, without additional probabilistic reasoning, such as prior probabilities or Bayes' theorem application, the most straightforward response acknowledging both groups' potential diversity should remain at 0.5.

Here's some reasoning:
- There are potentially 25 descriptions fitting computer science professors and 75 fitting humanities professors.
- While Jason's affinities suggest he could be more likely a computer science professor, humanities professors can have diverse interests too.
- Thus, until further statistical analysis is conducted, the probability based on the provided information alone points towards an equal assumption.
