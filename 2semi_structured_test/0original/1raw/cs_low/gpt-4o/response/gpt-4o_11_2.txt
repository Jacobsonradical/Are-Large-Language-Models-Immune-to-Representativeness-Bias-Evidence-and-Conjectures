Given the description of Jason, it is more likely that he is one of the computer science professors based on his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated with the computer science field. However, we must also take into account the base rates of the two groups involved in the study.

We know that there are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Thus, prior to considering the description, the probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now let’s apply Bayesian reasoning. We want to update this prior probability using the description provided. Assume \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.
  
Given that the description leans towards attributes that are more common with computer science (coding and mathematical puzzles), let’s assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|Humanities) = 0.2 \) (since it is
