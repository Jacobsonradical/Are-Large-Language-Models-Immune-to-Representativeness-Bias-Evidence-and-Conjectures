Based on the description of Jason—his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—one could hypothesize that these traits are more likely to be associated with a professor in computer science rather than in the humanities, given the nature of these interests.

We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, suggesting that before considering Jason's description, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), and the prior probability that he is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

However, the specifics in Jason's description heavily suggest traits and hobbies aligned with computer science. Thus, this significantly updates our prior belief considering the description provided.

Given all this, let's make an educated estimate.

{"probability": "0.85"}
