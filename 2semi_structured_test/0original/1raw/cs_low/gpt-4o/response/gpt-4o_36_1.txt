{"probability": "0.75"}

To determine this, I considered both the base rate of the populations under study and the description given. With 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of randomly picking a computer science professor is 0.25. However, the detailed description of Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) strongly suggests a higher likelihood that he is from the computer science group. Combining the base rate with the descriptive evidence leads to a higher adjusted probability estimate of 0.75.
