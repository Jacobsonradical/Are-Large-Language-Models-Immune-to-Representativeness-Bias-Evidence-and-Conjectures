Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it aligns more closely with the profile of a computer science professor. However, it's essential to consider the base rates of the populations in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor 0.25 and a humanities professor 0.75.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can update these probabilities with the given description. The description provided has characteristics that are more typical of the computer science profession (coding and solving mathematical puzzles), so we'll estimate that the likelihood of someone with Jason's description being a computer science professor is higher.

Although exact figures for the likelihoods are not provided, we can make a reasonable assumption that Jason's traits are significantly more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. For simplicity, let's assume that the likelihood of Jason's description for a computer science professor, P(description | CS), is 0.8, while for a humanities professor, P(description | H), it's 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)} 
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(CS | description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{
