To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities as well as the likelihood that Jason's description matches someone in either group.

### Priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihood:
We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason being described the way he is, conditioned on him being a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

**CS Professors:**
- Enjoy coding: highly likely.
- Solving mathematical puzzles: likely.
- Jogging: plausible, but neutral in this context.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing: likely.

**Humanities Professors:**
- Enjoy coding: unlikely.
- Solving mathematical puzzles: less likely.
- Jogging: plausible, but neutral in this context.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing: possible, but less characteristic.

Given that Jason's traits seem to align more closely with those typically associated with a computer science professor, we can reasonably assume that the likelihood favors the computer science group. We will denote these likelihoods as:
