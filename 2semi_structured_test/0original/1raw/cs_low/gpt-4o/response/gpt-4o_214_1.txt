Based on the given description, Jason's interests and talents suggest a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Despite this, we must account for the base rates of the groups in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:
- \(CS\) as a computer science professor,
- \(HU\) as a humanities professor.

Given:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Assuming Jason’s description aligns more closely with traits typical of a computer science professor, we can denote:
- \(P(D|CS)\), the probability of the description given a computer science professor, is quite high. Let’s estimate this to be 0.9.
- \(P(D|HU)\), the probability of the description given a humanities professor, is presumably lower. Let’s estimate this to be 0.1.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\) is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU)
