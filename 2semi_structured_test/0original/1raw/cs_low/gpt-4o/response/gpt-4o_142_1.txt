Given the description of Jason, we need to make an estimate about the likelihood of him being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 

First, let's consider the base probability, which is the initial probability of selecting a computer science professor out of the whole sample without any further information. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which gives us:
\[ \text{Base Probability (Computer Science)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Base Probability (Humanities)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's examine the description of Jason. Characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging seem to align more closely with a computer science background than a humanities one. The absence of enjoyment in activities like drawing or writing, which might be more typical of humanities professors, further supports this.

Given the strong alignment of Jason's traits with those typically associated with computer science professors, we can reasonably increase our estimate.

Taking these factors into account, I would assign a higher probability than the base rate for Jason being a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.8"}
