Given that the description matches traits that might be more common in computer science professors (e.g., enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it would be reasonable to think that Jason could be more likely to be one of the computer science professors. 

However, since we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, before considering the description, the base rate or prior probability that any given professor is a computer science professor is 0.25 (25 out of 100).

Given that the description seems more aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor, we can adjust our probability from the base rate upwards, but we do not have exact measures of how much more likely these traits are in computer science vs. humanities professors.

Nevertheless, we can make a reasonable adjustment:

{"probability": "0.6"}
