To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates (prior probabilities) of computer science versus humanities professors in the sample and how well Jasonâ€™s description matches typical characteristics of each group. 

First, let's note the base rates:
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

So, the prior probability (base rate) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

Given Jason's description, there are several characteristics that might be more typical of computer science professors:
- Enjoys coding.
- Solving mathematical puzzles.

These traits significantly align with common interests in the field of computer science and less so with the humanities.

The Bayesian formula helps us adjust our prior probability based on this new information, but since we lack exact likelihood values, we use a qualitative Bayesian approach:

Let's assign a high likelihood that a person described as enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is a computer science professor. Given the relevant details:

{"probability": "0.9"}
