Given the provided description and some statistical reasoning based on the sample sizes:

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
2. Jason's interests and traits seem to align more closely with those of a typical computer science professor (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles).

However, to find the probability more formally, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the probability of being a computer science professor (\( = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).
- \( P(Hum) \) be the probability of being a humanities professor (\( = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
- \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
