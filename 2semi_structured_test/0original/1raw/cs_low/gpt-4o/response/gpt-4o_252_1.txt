Given the information provided, it appears that Jason has traits and interests that are more aligned with a career in computer science (e.g., enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), despite the fact that the sample includes three times as many humanities professors as computer science professors. To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = Probability of being a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(\text{H}) \) = Probability of being a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need the probabilities of Jason's description given the two possible categories:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor

Although the precise probabilities \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \) are not given in the problem, we can make a reasonable assumption based on his interests and traits:
- Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is likely to be higher than \( P(\
