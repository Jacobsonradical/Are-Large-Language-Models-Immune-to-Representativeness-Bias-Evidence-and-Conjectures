Based on the description of Jason, it seems that his hobbies and interests, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, are more aligned with the typical interests of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Although this description suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor, we should also consider the base rates.

The base rates given in the study are:
- 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability. However, given that the information provided is more descriptive rather than numerical, we will make a subjective assessment based on the description and base rates.

Taking into account both the base rates and the fit of the description with the common traits of computer science professors, I will estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
