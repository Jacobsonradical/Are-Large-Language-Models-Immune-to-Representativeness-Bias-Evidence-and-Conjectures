{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the information provided in Jason's description, several aspects suggest a higher likelihood that he belongs to the computer science professors group:

1. Enjoys coding: Coding is a core activity and interest area for computer science professors.
2. Solving mathematical puzzles: This aligns more closely with the typical interests and skills of computer science professionals.
3. The lack of interest in drawing or writing: These activities are more traditionally associated with the humanities.

Considering these points, it seems more probable that Jason is a computer science professor. Therefore, estimating based on these clues and the initial distribution of professors in each field, a probability of 0.75 is reasonable.
