{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given the description of Jason's interests and characteristics, which include coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it is reasonable to infer that he might be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

This estimation takes into account the fact that out of 100 professors, 25 are in computer science and 75 are in humanities. Despite the larger number of humanities professors, Jason's interests appear more aligned with the typical profile of a computer science professor. This balance between the number distribution and the specific interests described leads to a probability estimate of 0.75 for Jason being a computer science professor.
