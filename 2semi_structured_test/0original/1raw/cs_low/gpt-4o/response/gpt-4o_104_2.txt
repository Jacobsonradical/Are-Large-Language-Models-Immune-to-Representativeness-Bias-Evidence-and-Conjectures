Given the description of Jason's interests and personality traits, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor, especially since he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. The sample sizes are also important to consider: 25 computer science professors versus 75 humanities professors.

However, it’s important not to ignore the base rates. Here's the detailed calculation using Bayes' theorem:

Let's denote:
- \( C \) to be the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) to be the event Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) to be the event that Jason's description matches.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) = 0.25 \) (25 out of 100 professors are in computer science)
- \( P(H) = 0.75 \) (75 out of 100 professors are in humanities)

Assuming the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) represent how much the description matches typical computer science and humanities professors respectively. Given the description, \( P(D|C) \) is very high due to Jason’s preference for coding and mathematical puzzles. Let’s approximate
