To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups and the given description's alignment with typical traits associated with each group.

Given:
- 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) as the probability Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) as the probability Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

Assuming the description provided aligns more closely with characteristics typically associated with computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than humanities professors, let's make an educated guess on the likelihood ratios.
