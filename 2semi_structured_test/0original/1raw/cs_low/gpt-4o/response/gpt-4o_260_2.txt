{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the idea that Jason's activities and traits (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are more closely aligned with typical interests and skills of computer science professors than those of humanities professors, despite the fact that there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample. Using a Bayesian approach to account for the base rate (1:3 ratio of computer science to humanities professors), itâ€™s reasonable to increase the probability that Jason fits the computer science profile, but also be mindful of the higher number of humanities professors.
