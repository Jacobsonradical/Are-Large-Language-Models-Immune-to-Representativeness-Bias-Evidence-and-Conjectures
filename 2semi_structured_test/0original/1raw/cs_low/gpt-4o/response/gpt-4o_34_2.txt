To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let CS represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and H represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's find P(CS) and P(H):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we don't have specific information about the likelihood of the description for each group, we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups given only the provided information about their personality traits and interests. Thus, \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \).

Therefore,
