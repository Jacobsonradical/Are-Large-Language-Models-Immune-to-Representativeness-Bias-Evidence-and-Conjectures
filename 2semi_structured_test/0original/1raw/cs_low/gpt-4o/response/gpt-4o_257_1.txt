{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the details about Jason's interests (coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it makes him more likely to be one of the computer science professors. However, the base rate of the sample (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors) still needs to be considered. By assigning a higher probability while still accounting for the larger proportion of humanities professors, 0.75 seems like a reasonable estimate.
