Given the description of Jason, let's analyze the likelihood of him being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

**Base Rate Information:**
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors: 100

**Personality and Interests Description:**
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly aligned with computer science.
- His overall profile suggests a personality and set of interests that are more typical for someone in the computer science field.

**Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Given Jason's description, the activities and characteristics are stereotypically more aligned with the computer science discipline, significantly increasing his likelihood of being a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

By applying some form of heuristic based on the characteristics aligning well with computer science, the probability increases significantly for Jason fitting this profile. This form of reasoning can lead to what seems to be an overestimation due to representativeness heuristics. However, letâ€™s estimate the likelihood given this descriptive fit favoring computer science.

Using a rough form of Bayesian reasoning, we adjust upward for the fact his interests strongly correlate with computer science, from an initial base rate of 0.25 to something notably
