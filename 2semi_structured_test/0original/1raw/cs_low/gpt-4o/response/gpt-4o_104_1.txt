To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
    - The prior probability \(P(CS)\) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
      \[
      P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
      \]
    - The prior probability \(P(H)\) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
      \[
      P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
      \]

2. **Likelihood**:
    - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(D|CS)\), and the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(D|H)\).
    - Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits suggest a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. 

For simplicity, let's make a reasonable assumption that:

    - The likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) is high, say 0.8.
    - The likelihood \(P(D|H)\) is low, say 0.2.
