{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason and the fact that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he would be a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. While there are fewer computer science professors in the sample (25) compared to humanities professors (75), his interests and personality traits align more closely with those typical of a computer science professor. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is higher than that he is one of the humanities professors. Adjusting for the unequal sample sizes, I estimate the probability at 0.75.
