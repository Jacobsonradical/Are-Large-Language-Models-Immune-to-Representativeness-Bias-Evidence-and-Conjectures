{"probability": "0.75"}

To explain my reasoning: We know from the problem statement that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. This means that, to begin with, the base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, the description of Jason includes details (such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing) that are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. These traits significantly shift the likelihood towards Jason being a computer science professor, overwhelming the initial base rate. While the traits of carefulness, talent, and ambition are common across both fields, the interest in coding and mathematical puzzles strongly suggest a computer science background.

Hence, factoring in these aspects, I have increased the probability significantly while still keeping in mind that the sample contains more humanities professors.
