Given the description of Jason and the information provided about the study, we need to make an informed estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

1. The base rates for the two groups:
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   Hence, the overall probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. Based on the description, Jason has qualities associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). These traits seem more consistent with a computer science professor's profile than a humanities professor's.

Therefore, considering both the base rate and the specific traits described, we adjust our probability estimate.

Let's assume that these traits increase the likelihood but still account for the initial base rate. An appropriate revised estimate could be:

{"probability": "0.6"}
