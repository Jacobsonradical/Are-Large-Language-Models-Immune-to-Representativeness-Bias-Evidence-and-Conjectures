Let's analyze the given description:

- Jason enjoys coding, which is strongly associated with computer science professors.
- He likes solving mathematical puzzles, which again aligns closely with the skills and interests often seen in computer science professors.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities but less so with computer science.

Given this information, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors. However, we should also take into account the base rates, meaning the prior probability based on the sample sizes:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so without any additional information, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and for a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the strong indicators in Jason's description that align with typical computer science interests, we should adjust the probability upward from the base rate of 0.25.

Considering both the descriptive alignment and base rates, a reasonable estimate might be:

{"probability": "0.8"}
