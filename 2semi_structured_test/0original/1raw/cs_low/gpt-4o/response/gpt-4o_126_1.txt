Given the description of Jason and the background information about the study, we can use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor.

We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Jason's interests and traits strongly align with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and are less common in humanities professors. We need to make an educated judgment about \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \] (high likelihood given his alignment with computer science traits)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \] (lower likelihood given less typical alignment for humanities traits)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \
