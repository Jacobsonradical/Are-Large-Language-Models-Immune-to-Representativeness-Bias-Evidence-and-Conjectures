Given the conditions of the study, we know that there were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. If we assume that the description provided (Jason's description) is equally likely to describe a professor from either discipline, we need to take into account both the number of professors in each field and Jason's characteristics. 

Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests that he is more likely to be one of the computer science professors, because these activities are more commonly associated with computer science than with the humanities. 

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, a method based on conditional probabilities. The prior probabilities (before considering specific characteristics) are:
- P(CS) = probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities) = probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

Given Jason's characteristics (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles), we can denote these by "traits." The likelihood of these traits given the discipline is:
- P(traits | CS) = higher likelihood (let's assume a relatively high probability for simplicity, such as 0.9)
- P(traits | Humanities) = lower likelihood (let's assume a relatively low probability for simplicity, such as 0.1)

We want to find P(CS | traits), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor
