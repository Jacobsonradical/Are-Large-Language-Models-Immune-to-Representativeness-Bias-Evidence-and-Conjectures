Given that Jason's interests include coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—activities that strongly align with the field of computer science—the probability that Jason is more likely one of the computer science professors rather than one from the humanities seems quite high.

However, we also need to consider the base rates of the two groups sampled: 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This setup suggests that any randomly chosen description is statistically more likely to belong to a humanities professor simply because there are three times as many of them in the sample.

To balance the specific description and the base rates, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's a simplified way to think about it:

1. **Base Rate for Computer Science Professors (CS):** 25%
2. **Base Rate for Humanities Professors (H):** 75%

### Calculations:
- Prior probability of a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability of a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of Jason's description if he is a CS professor (high due to interest in coding and puzzles).
- Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor (low due to mismatch with typical interests).

Since the specific description aligns much more
