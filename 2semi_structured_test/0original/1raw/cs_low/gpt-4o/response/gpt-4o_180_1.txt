Given the information provided, we are tasked with estimating the probability that Jason belongs to the group of computer science professors rather than the humanities professors. 

We start by noting the base rates: there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, and 75 humanities professors out of 100 total. These base rates are important for our prior probabilities. 

Next, we consider the description given. The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These interests seem more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we must also consider the possibility that some humanities professors could still share these interests, albeit probably less frequently.

Using Bayes' theorem, we combine the prior probability (based on base rates) with the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS) and P(Hum))**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25.
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities, P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Likelihood of the given characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) if Jason is a computer science professor, which we'll denote as P(Description|CS).
   - Likelihood of the given characteristics if Jason is a humanities professor, P(Description|Hum
