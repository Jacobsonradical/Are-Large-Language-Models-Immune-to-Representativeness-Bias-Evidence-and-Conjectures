{"probability": "0.75"}

Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely aligned with activities typical of computer science professors, the higher probability value reflects the stronger alignment with the profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Furthermore, the sample contains a smaller proportion of computer science professors, but because the description is heavily suggestive of interests typically associated with computer science, the probability value leans significantly in favor of him being a computer science professor.
