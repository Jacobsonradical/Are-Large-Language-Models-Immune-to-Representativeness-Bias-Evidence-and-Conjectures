To assess the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we should consider both the base rates of the two groups in the sample and the specific characteristics described. Here's the process:

1. **Base Rate:** The base rate is the prior probability of each group. In the sample, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the base rates are as follows:
   - Probability of computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood:** We need to consider the likelihood that someone with Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing) would be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Considering Jason's characteristics:
- Interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly aligned with computer science.
- His lack of interest in drawing or writing aligns more with a computer science profile.

Given these points, let's assume that the likelihood that these characteristics match a computer science professor is much higher than matching a humanities professor.

3. **Bayesian Inference:** Using Bayes' theorem, which states:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS
