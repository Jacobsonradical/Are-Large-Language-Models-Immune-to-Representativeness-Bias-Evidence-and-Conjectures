{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
To determine the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, examining the base rates of the groups and the description's fit.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Base rate probability:
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

We need to form reasonable assumptions about how well Jason's description fits each group.

"A conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious person who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles" strongly hints towards a computer science professor. "Jogging" and "not enjoying drawing or writing" contribute less significantly to distinguishing between groups. The fit seems notably stronger for a computer science professor.

While specific detailed likelihoods (how each personality trait quantitatively fits each group) are not provided, intuitively, the combined traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing/writing) more strongly align with computer science.

If we assume:

- Probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description (P(D|CS)) = 0.90
- Probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description (P(D|H)) = 0.30

We then calculate:

P(CS|D) = (P
