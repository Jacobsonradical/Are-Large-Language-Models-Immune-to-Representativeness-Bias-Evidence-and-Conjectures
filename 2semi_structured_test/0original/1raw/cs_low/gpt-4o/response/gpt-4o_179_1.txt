{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: This estimation is based on Bayesian reasoning, where we take into account the base rates of the two groups and then update these probabilities based on how well Jason's description matches typical characteristics associated with each group. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns closely with activities common among computer science professors, thus tipping the scale in favor of his being a computer science professor despite the larger number of humanities professors in the sample.
