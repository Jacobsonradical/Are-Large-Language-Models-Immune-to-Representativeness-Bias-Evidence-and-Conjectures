Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing suggest he might be more aligned with typical interests of someone in computer science rather than humanities. However, we must also consider the base rates provided: 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.

Given these factors and using Bayes' theorem to update our probability based on the description, I would estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors to be relatively high but also tempered by the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
