{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: We have two groups in the study, one group consists of 25 computer science professors and the other consists of 75 humanities professors. Without any description, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group would be 25/(25+75) = 0.25.

The description of Jason suggests several traits and interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) that are more closely associated with computer science. These details make it more likely that Jason is from the computer science group.

Bayesian reasoning can be applied here to update the prior probability (0.25) based on the description of Jason. Since the description strongly aligns with traits and interests typical of computer science professors, a reasonable updated probability could be about 0.75. This is considered without precise calculations but rather an intuitive adjustment towards a higher probability given the relevant details.
