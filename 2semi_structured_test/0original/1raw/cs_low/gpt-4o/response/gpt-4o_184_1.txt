{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: There are several reasons for this probability estimation:

1. **Sample Sizes**: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Hence, initially, the probability of choosing a computer science professor at random is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Personality Fit**: Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science professionals. Additionally, the description highlights traits such as being conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, and highly creative but not interested in drawing or writing, which are more aligned with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Combining the initial probability with the significant alignment in personality and interests towards computer science, I have adjusted the probability upwards to 0.75.
