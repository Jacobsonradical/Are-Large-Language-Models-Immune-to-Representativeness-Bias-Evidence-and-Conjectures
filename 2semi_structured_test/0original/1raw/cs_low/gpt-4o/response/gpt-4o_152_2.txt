{"probability": "0.75"}

This conclusion is derived by considering the base rates of the two populations and the specific traits mentioned in Jason's description. Given the sample sizes of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors and after comparing Jason's traits with what might be more common in each group, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Factors such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor. Therefore, the probability of 0.75, while not absolute certainty, reflects the likelihood favored by the given information.
