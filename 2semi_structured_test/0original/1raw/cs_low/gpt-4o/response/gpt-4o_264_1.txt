{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning follows the base rate principle from statistics and probability theory. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. The traits and interests listed for Jason (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing) are more stereotypically aligned with computer science professors. This increased specificity can adjust the prior probability upward from the base rate.
