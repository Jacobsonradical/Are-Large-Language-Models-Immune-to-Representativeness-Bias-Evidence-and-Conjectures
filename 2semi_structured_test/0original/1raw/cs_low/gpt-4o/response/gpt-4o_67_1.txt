{"probability": "0.75"}

Reasoning: The description of Jason includes traits and activities that typically align more with a computer science professor's profile, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Given the ratio of 25 computer science professors to 75 humanities professors, and the specific characteristics mentioned in Jason's description, the probability that he is a computer science professor is higher than that of a humanities professor. Therefore, 0.75 is a reasonable estimate.
