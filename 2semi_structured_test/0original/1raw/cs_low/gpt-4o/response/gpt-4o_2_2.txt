{"probability": "0.25"}

Explanation: We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which means there's a 25% chance (0.25 probability) that any randomly selected professor is from the computer science department, assuming no other information. Jason's interests and traits, such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying writing or drawing, might suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor, but since the problem asks for a calculation based on available information, we'll stick with the base rate probability given the sample sizes.
