{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from combining the base rate of the two groups and the specific interests and traits of Jason that align more closely with typical traits of computer science professors. The base rate informs us that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, meaning there's a 0.25 prior probability that any given description belongs to a computer science professor. However, Jasonâ€™s interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing heavily suggest a computer science background, leading us to significantly adjust the probability upwards based on these characteristics. Given these considerations, 0.75 is a reasonable estimated probability.
