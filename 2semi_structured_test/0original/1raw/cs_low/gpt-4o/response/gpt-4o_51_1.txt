{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this probability estimate is based on the following:
- Jason's interest in activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly align with a computer science professor's profile.
- The description doesn't align as closely with typical humanities interests, such as drawing or writing.
- With initial probabilities based on the sample size (25% chance for computer science, 75% for humanities), Jason's interests significantly skew this towards the computer science side. Therefore, 0.75 seems like a balanced estimate for the probability.
