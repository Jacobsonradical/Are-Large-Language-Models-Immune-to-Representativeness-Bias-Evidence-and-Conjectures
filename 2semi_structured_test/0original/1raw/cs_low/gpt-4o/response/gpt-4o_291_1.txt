{"probability": "0.75"}

To explain, here's a brief reasoning: Given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems significantly more likely that he is one of the computer science professors. Even though there are more humanities professors in the sample, Jason's specific interests and professional characteristics align much more closely with those typically associated with computer science. Using Bayesian reasoning, this balance suggests a higher probability, so I've estimated it to be 0.75.
