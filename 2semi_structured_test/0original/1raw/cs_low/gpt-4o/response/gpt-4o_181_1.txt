Given the information provided, to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- A1: Jason is a computer science professor.
- A2: Jason is a humanities professor.
- B: The description of Jason (a 45-year-old married man with five children, who is conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing).

We are looking for P(A1 | B), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A1 | B) = \frac{P(B | A1) \cdot P(A1)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- P(A1) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor in the sample is a computer science professor.
- P(B | A1) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(B) is the overall probability of the description.

The prior probability P(A1) can be calculated as:
\[ P(A1) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability P(A2) is:
\[ P(A2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \
