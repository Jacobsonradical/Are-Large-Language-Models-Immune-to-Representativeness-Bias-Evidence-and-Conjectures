To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step application of the theorem in this context:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total professors = 25 + 75 = 100.
   - Prior probability of a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Prior probability of a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor \( P(D | CS) \) and the likelihood given he is a humanities professor \( P(D | H) \).

Since Jason's description includes characteristics more aligned with computer science (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we can make reasonable assumptions here:

   - Let's assume \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high. For simplicity, we might estimate this as \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \).
   - Conversely, \( P(D | H) \) might be lower. For estimation, let's use \( P(D | H) \approx 0.2 \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
