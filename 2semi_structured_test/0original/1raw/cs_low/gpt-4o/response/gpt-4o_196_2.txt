{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's my reasoning: 

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
2. Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more directly with typical activities associated with computer science than with the humanities.
3. Given that the ratio of computer science to humanities professors is 1:3, but Jason's traits strongly suggest a computer science background, one might heavily weight the probability towards computer science despite the initial lower representation.

Thus, combining the base rates with the personality match, the estimated probability reflects a strong inclination towards computer science but also considers the original distribution.
