To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use the principles of Bayesian inference. We start with the base rates (or prior probabilities) of the two groups:

- Probability of a professor being in computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of a professor being in the humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely it is that a description like Jason's would be observed in each group. Given the description of Jason, it seems more aligned with traits typical of computer science professors due to his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which might be more stereotypically associated with humanities scholars. However, without concrete probabilities for these traits in each group, we can only hypothesize that these traits are significantly more common among CS professors.

To simplify the estimation without precise likelihoods, we assume that Jason's profile makes it considerably more probable that he is in computer science. Let's assign a higher likelihood to Jason being in the CS group than the humanities group based on the descriptive traits alone. For example, if we hypothesize that Jason is 4 times more likely to be in the CS group compared to the humanities group based on the description:

- Likelihood (traits | CS): \( P(\text{traits} | CS
