Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, a random selection has a 1 in 4 (or 0.25) prior probability of being a computer science professor.

However, based on Jason's description, there are additional factors that align more closely with characteristics one might expect in a computer science professor (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying writing or drawing). This suggests that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the prior probability to reflect this additional information. If we assume that the characteristics described (enjoying coding, solving puzzles, not enjoying writing or drawing) are much more common among computer science professors than among humanities professors, we can reasonably increase the likelihood above the prior probability.

Here's a simplified way to adjust our probability to take this information into account:
1. Set the prior probability \( P(CS) = 0.25 \).
2. Set the prior probability \( P(Hum) = 0.75 \).

Assume the likelihood of Jason's characteristics being observed among computer science professors \( P(X|CS) \) is higher than that among humanities professors \( P(X|Hum) \).

To keep it simple, let's suppose:
- \( P(X|CS) \) is about 0.8 (high likelihood given description fits well).
- \( P(X|Hum) \) is about 0.2 (low
