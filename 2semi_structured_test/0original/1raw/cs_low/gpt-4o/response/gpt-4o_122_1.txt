{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Using Bayes' theorem is appropriate in this case to revise the probability estimate based on the given characteristics. 

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (prior probability) \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Based on the given description, Jason's interests such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more characteristic of the typical profile of a computer science professor. Assuming the likelihood that Jason has the described traits given he is a computer science professor is high, let's denote \(P(\text{Traits}|CS)\).

   - The traits are less characteristic of a humanities professor, so we will assume that \(P(\text{Traits}|H) < P(\text{Traits}|CS)\).

   Since we don't have the exact likelihoods, a reasonable estimate is that \(P(\text{Traits}|CS) = 0.9\) (high likelihood) and \(P(\text{Traits}|H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood).

3. **Bayes' Theorem Application:**

   \[
   P(CS|\text{Traits}) = \frac{P(\text{Traits}|CS) \cdot
