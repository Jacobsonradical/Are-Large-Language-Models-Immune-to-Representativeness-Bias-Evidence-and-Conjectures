To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - \( P(Hum) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. Calculate the likelihoods:
   - \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(D | Hum) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

While we don't have exact numerical values for these likelihoods, we can reasonably infer that the description of enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing fits more stereotypically with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor.

3. Apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To calculate \( P(D) \), we consider:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | Hum) * P(Hum) \]

Given the information and likely values:
- \( P(D | CS) \
