Given the information and considering the number of professors in each group, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- 25 computer science professors (P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25)
- 75 humanities professors (P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75)

The provided description indicates Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors. Thus, P(description | C) is assumed to be higher than P(description | H).

Letâ€™s assume a relative likelihood:
- P(description | C) = 0.9 (since the traits highly align with a computer science professor)
- P(description | H) = 0.1 (since the traits less align with a humanities professor)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|description) = \frac{P(description | C) * P(C)}{P(description)} \]
where
\[ P(description) = P(description | C) * P(C) + P(description | H) * P(H) \]

First, calculate \( P(description) \):
\[ P(description) = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75)
