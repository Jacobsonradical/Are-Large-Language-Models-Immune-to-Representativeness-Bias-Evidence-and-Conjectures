To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant quantities:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\): Description of Jason

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's determine prior probabilities \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):

- \(P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\):

Given the description, it is reasonable to assume that someone who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles has a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor. Let's assume:

- \(P(D|C) = 0.90\) (high likelihood given the description fits a computer science professor)
- \(P(D|H) =
