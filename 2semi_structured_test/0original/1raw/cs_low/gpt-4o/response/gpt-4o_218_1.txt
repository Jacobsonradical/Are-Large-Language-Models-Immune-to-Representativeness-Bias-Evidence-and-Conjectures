To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' rule.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that the description matches Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' rule:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   This is the probability of having the description match Jason's description if he is a computer science professor. Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are usually more associated with computer science, we can assume this likelihood is high but we need a specific estimate.

3. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
