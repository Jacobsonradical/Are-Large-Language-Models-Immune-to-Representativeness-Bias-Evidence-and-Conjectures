{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer considers both base rates and the fit of the description to each group. Initially, the base rate probability is 0.25 (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science). However, Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and personality do align more closely with common stereotypes of computer science professors. By adjusting for these factors, an updated estimate falls closer to 0.75 for the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.
