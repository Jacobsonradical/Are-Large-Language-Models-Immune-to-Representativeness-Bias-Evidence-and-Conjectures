Given the description of Jason, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that he is a computer science professor. 

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to evaluate how likely it is that a person with Jasonâ€™s characteristics (enjoying coding, math puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing) would be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   - Given the provided traits, it's reasonable to assume these are more common in computer science professors due to the nature of coding and mathematical problem-solving.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - The exact likelihoods are not provided, but we can qualitatively say that it is much more likely for a person with Jason's profile to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Given these considerations, we can reasonably estimate the posterior probability using qualitative insights adjusted by the base rates:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's description}) \approx \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS}) \cd
