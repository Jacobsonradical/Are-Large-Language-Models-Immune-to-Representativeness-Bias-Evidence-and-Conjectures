{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
While we can only provide an estimate based on the information provided and cannot determine an exact probability without further context, we can use Bayesian reasoning with the base rates to arrive at this probability. The base rate for computer science professors among the sample is 25/100 or 0.25. The description given aligns more closely with attributes and interests commonly associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles). Given this information, we might increase the likelihood that Jason belongs to the computer science group. Nevertheless, without conducting a formal Bayesian analysis, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor might reasonably be estimated as 0.75, accounting for the strong alignment of his interests with the field while keeping in mind that base rates may still impact the overall probability.
