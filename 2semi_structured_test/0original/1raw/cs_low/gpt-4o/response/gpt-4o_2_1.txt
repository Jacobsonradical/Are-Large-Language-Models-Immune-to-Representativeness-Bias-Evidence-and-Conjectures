To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem for our specific case can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Jason's description}) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

Jason's description includes traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical among computer science
