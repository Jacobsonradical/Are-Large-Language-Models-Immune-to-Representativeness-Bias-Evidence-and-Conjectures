Given the description of Jason, we must apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to determine how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor.
   - Given his interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) and traits (creative, conservative, careful, ambitious), it seems plausible that Jason fits the stereotype of a computer science professor more than that of a humanities professor.

3. **Applying Bayes’ Theorem:**
   - Let’s denote:
     - P(D|CS) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
     - P(D|H) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Assuming P(D|CS) is much higher due to his specific interests aligning with computer science, we would factor this heavily into our calculation. For simplification, let’s assume:
   - P(D|CS) ≈ 0.
