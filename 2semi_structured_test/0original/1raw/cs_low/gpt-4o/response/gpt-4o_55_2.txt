{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given Jason's interests and personality traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles while not enjoying drawing or writing, it is more likely that he is one of the computer science professors. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Without considering the description, the base rate probability of him being a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\). However, Jason's hobbies and traits suggest he aligns more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor, so I increased the probability to 0.75 to reflect this alignment.
