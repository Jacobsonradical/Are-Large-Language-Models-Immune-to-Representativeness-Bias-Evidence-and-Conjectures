{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning:

The base rates of the two groups are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Therefore, the probability of picking a computer science professor at random (\( P(CS) \)) is 0.25, and the probability of picking a humanities professor at random (\( P(H) \)) is 0.75.

Given the description of Jason, the traits and interests do align more strongly with a typical computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Specifically:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: This is more strongly associated with computer science.
- Highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing: This could be seen as neutral but slightly leaning towards computer science due to the lack of interest in writing or drawing.

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

We need to determine \( P(CS | D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Qualitatively assessing, \( P(D | CS) \) seems higher than \( P(D | H) \). If we estimate:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | H) \
