Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation using principles from Bayes' theorem and base rates. 

First, we'll take into account the base rates:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we'll consider how well Jason's description matches the typical profiles of each discipline. Jason's activities and interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and his lack of interest in drawing or writing align more closely with the common stereotypes of computer science professors. This aligns more with the qualities typical of a computer science professor.

Given the strong alignment of Jason's traits with those typically expected of a computer science professor, we might assign a high likelihood to the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it is important to consider the base rate fallacy and that initial probabilities should heavily influence our final probability judgment.

Considering all the factors and attempting a balanced judgment using Bayes' theorem intuitively, it's reasonable to significantly update the probability in favor of Jason being a computer science professor due to the described characteristics but not to entirely disregard the base rates.

Thus, the estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can
