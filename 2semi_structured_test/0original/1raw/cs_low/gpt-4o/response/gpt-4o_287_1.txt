Given the provided description and under the assumptions of the problem, we use Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probability. Here's how we can think about it:

1. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

2. The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:
\[
P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

3. Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description "Jason" being a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

Given Jason’s traits and interests (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), he seems more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We assume this likelihood based on stereotypical associations.

Let’s denote:
- \(P(D | CS)\) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, \(P(D | CS)\) can be considered quite high, say around 0.9, since Jason
