Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, these traits align more closely with what one might expect from a computer science professor. To determine the probability, we'll apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided (Jason's profile).

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = The prior probability that the description is of a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = The prior probability that the description is of a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests that are aligned with computer science (coding, puzzles), we can assume that \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high. Conversely, because Jason's interest profile doesn't align well with typical humanities activities, \( P(B|\neg A) \) will be relatively low.

For simplicity let's assume
