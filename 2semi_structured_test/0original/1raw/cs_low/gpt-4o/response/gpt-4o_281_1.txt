{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
This problem can be approached using Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here it is applied to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, we need the base rates (priors) for each group:
- There are 25 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Therefore, the prior probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the description given each group. The description fits more naturally with a computer science professor because it mentions enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Letâ€™s simplify and assume a higher likelihood for computer science professors (say 0.9) and a lower likelihood for humanities professors (say 0.2):
\[ P(Desc | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(Desc | Hum) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{
