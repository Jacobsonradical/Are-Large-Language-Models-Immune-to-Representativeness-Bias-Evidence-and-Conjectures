{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing, these traits seem more aligned with the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Based on the given sample sizes (25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors), a naive estimate would be 0.25 based on sheer numbers. However, Jason's described traits heavily skew the probability toward him being a computer science professor. Thus, 0.75 is a reasonable estimate.
