Given the description and the information provided in the study, I'll use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor)

The likelihoods are more subjective and based on the given description:
- Let's assume \( P(description|CS) = 0.8 \) (the description fits what you'd expect more from a computer science professor, given his interests in coding and mathematical puzzles)
- Let's assume \( P(description|H) = 0.2 \) (the description fits less what you'd expect from a humanities professor, despite some possible overlap in traits)

Now, we'll apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cd
