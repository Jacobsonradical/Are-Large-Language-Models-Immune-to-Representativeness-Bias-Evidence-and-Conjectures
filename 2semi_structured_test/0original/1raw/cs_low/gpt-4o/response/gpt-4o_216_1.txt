{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning is based on the base rate probability known from the sample sizes. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the initial base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, the description of Jason fits more with typical interests and personality traits associated with computer science (e.g., enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, conservative and careful nature), rather than humanities. 

Given this additional information, the probability is adjusted upward to 0.75, reflecting a stronger likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, while still considering the base rate which suggests a 0.25 initial chance.
