Given the provided description and the context of the study, the probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- Probability of being a Computer Science professor (CS): \( P(CS) \)
- Probability of being a Humanities professor (H): \( P(H) \)

Since there are 25 CS professors and 75 Humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, consider the likelihood of the description given the professorâ€™s domain:
- Probability of the description given a CS professor: \( P(D|CS) \)
- Probability of the description given a Humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \)

Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical problems, which are more closely associated with CS professors than Humanities professors. Because of this, we may assume:
\[ P(D|CS) > P(D|H) \]

For the sake of this example, let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \]

Bayes' theorem helps us to find the updated probability that Jason is from the CS category given his description:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(C
