Given Jason's traits and interests, we can make an intuitive inference about his likelihood of belonging to either group of professors. However, we should use Bayes' Theorem to properly calculate the probability while considering base rates.

We are given:
- 25 computer science professors.
- 75 humanities professors.
- Total = 100 professors.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science professors. While his conservative and careful nature might fit either group, his specific interest in coding and mathematical puzzles is a stronger indicator for computer science.

Let's denote:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to approximate:
- \(P(D|C)\): Probability of Jason's traits given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of Jason's traits given that he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since Jason's description strongly aligns with interests typical of computer science
