{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description, Jason’s interests and personality traits—such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—seem to align more closely with the typical interests and activities of a computer science professor. However, we must also consider the base rates; there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Despite the traits strongly suggesting a computer science background, the larger number of humanities professors can't be completely ignored. Combining these factors, a reasonable estimate of the probability would be approximately 0.75 or 75%.
