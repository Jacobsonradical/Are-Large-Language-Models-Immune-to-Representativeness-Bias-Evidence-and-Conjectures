To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Initially, we know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor is 25/100 or 0.25.
- The prior probability (P(H)) that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor is 75/100 or 0.75.

We then need to consider how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given Jason's specific traits and interests, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these traits are more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- P(D|CS) as the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- P(D|H) as the probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

Given the described traits and interests:
- P(D|CS) is quite high, since enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly associated with computer science.
- P(D|H) is relatively low, since these traits and interests are less common in the humanities.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- P(D|CS) = 0.9 (90% chance that the description fits a computer science professor)
- P(D|H) = 0.1 (10% chance that
