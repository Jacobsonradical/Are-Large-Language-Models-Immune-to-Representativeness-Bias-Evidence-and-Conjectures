{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description, Jason's interests and traits seem more aligned with those commonly associated with computer science professors (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities professors. Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is higher. However, since there are 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors in the sample, we must take this base rate into account, resulting in a probability of 0.75 that balances these factors.
