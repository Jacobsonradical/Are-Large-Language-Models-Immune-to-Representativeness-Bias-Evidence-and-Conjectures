{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from the base rate of the sample as well as the match between Jason's interests and the common activities and traits of individuals in computer science. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any given professor being from computer science is 0.25. However, Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging aligns more strongly with the typical activities and interests of computer science professors, thus increasing the probability from the base rate.
