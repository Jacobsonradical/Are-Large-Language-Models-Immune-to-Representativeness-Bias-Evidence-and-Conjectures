Given the problem, to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors instead of one from the humanities, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a way to find a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

Here's the information given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the probability of picking a computer science professor (P(CS)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), and the probability of picking a humanities professor (P(H)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' Theorem, we'll need to know the probabilities associated with the description fitting either group. Given the personality traits and interests described, it seems more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the description fitting Jason.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.8 \) (This is an educated guess based on stereotypical alignment).
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (This is also an educated guess based on stereotypical alignment).

Using Bayes' The
