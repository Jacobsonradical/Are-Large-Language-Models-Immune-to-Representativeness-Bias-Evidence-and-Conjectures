To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. The theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Here's the information we have:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) is 75/100 = 0.75.

We need to consider how likely a description like Jason’s fits the profiles of each group. The description suggests traits more aligned with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging), rather than humanities, where such hobbies might be less common.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need:
- P(D | CS): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- P(D | H): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- P(D): Overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's assume reasonably that:
- P(D | CS) is high, say 0.8 (80% of computer science professors might have a description like Jason’s).
- P(D | H) is low, say 0.2 (20% of humanities professors might have a description like Jason’s).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \
