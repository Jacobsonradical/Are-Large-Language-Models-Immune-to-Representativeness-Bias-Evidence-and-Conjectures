{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, the traits and interests such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore, there is a higher probability that he is among the 25 computer science professors in the sample. Using Bayesian reasoning:

- Prior probability (base rate for being in computer science): \( P(CS) = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability (base rate for being in humanities): \( P(H) = 0.75 \)

Since Jason's description fits more closely with the stereotypical description of a computer science professor, we adjust our probability accordingly.

If you were to use a more detailed Bayesian calculation, you'd need likelihoods based on how common such descriptions are within each discipline, which are not provided here. However, based on heuristic reasoning, the probability \( P(CS|description) \) seems reasonably high.
