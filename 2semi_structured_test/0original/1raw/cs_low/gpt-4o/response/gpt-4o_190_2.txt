Given the description of Jason and the setup of the study, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- We are presented with one description out of a total of 100 available descriptions.

First, let's denote the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that someone is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that someone is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description given that the person is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

Considering Jason's description:
