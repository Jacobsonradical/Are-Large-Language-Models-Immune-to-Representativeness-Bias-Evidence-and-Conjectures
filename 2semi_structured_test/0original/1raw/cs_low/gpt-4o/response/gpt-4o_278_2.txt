{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
Given the description, Jason has attributes that are more typically associated with computer science professors, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, if we had no additional information, the baseline probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be 0.25. However, his specific interests and traits align more closely with those expected of someone in computer science, thereby increasing the likelihood. Thus, considering the alignment of interests and characteristics with the field, a reasonable estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is enhanced to 0.75.
