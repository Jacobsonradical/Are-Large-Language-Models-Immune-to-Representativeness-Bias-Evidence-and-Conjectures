To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, one can apply principles from Bayesian probability.

From the problem statement:
- 25 professors are in computer science (25% of the sample)
- 75 professors are in humanities (75% of the sample)

Bayesian inference can help combine this prior information with the likelihood of Jason fitting into each category.

Let's denote:
- \(P(CS)\) = probability a professor is from computer science = 0.25
- \(P(H)\) = probability a professor is from humanities = 0.75

Given Jason's description, we need to estimate:
- \(P(D|CS)\): Probability of Jason fitting the description, given he is a computer science professor
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of Jason fitting the description, given he is a humanities professor

Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his disinterest in drawing or writing, fits more stereotypically with computer science over humanities. Therefore, \(P(D|CS)\) might be significantly higher than \(P(D|H)\).

Given the subjective nature and without specific test details for precise likelihoods, but based on typical profiles, assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\) = 0.9 (very likely fits a computer science profile)
- \(P(D|H)\) = 0.1 (less likely fits a humanities profile)

Using Bayes' theorem:
