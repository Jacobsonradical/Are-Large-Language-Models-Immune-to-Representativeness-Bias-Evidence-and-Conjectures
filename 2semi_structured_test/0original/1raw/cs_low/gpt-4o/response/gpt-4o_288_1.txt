Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and considering his other traits such as being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, it is reasonable to initially think he might fit into the computer science category more than the humanities.

Despite this inclination, we must consider the base rates in the sample. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, giving us the following prior probabilities:
- Probability of randomly picking a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of randomly picking a humanities professor (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Now, given Jason's description, let's denote the probability of this description given a computer science professor as P(Description|CS) and the probability of this description given a humanities professor as P(Description|H).

Although the description leans towards characteristics common in computer science, without specific values for P(Description|CS) and P(Description|H), we can use a subjective judgment based on the provided characteristics. For instance, coding and solving mathematical puzzles are activities more strongly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore, let's assume:
- P(Description|CS) = 0.8
- P(Description|H) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(CS|Description) = [P(Description|CS) * P(CS)] / [P(Description|CS)
