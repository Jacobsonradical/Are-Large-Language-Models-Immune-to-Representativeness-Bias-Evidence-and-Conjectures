Based on the description provided, Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, align more closely with typical activities and traits associated with computer science professors rather than humanities professors. 

Given that the base rate or prior probability of being a computer science professor in the sample is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), and considering that Jason's description fits the stereotype of a computer science professor better, we need to update our probability reflecting this match.

Using Bayes' Theorem qualitatively (without detailed numerical likelihoods), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor would increase from the prior base rate of 0.25 because his description is more typical of a computer science professor.

However, without precise likelihood values, the exact posterior probability is subject to interpretation. A reasonable increase from the base rate might place the probability significantly higher but not extremely close to 1, due to some overlap in traits between the fields.

A moderate and reasonable updated probability might be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
