{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived by considering Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly indicative of a background in computer science. Despite providing a balanced description that could technically apply to professors in either field, the specific activities Jason enjoys suggest a higher likelihood that he is in computer science. Combining these hobbies with his ambitious and careful personality reinforces this assessment. Whereas a prior distribution might suggest a 0.25 probability (based on sample sizes alone: 25 computer science to 100 total), the description allows for a reassessment skewed towards a higher probability for computer science.
