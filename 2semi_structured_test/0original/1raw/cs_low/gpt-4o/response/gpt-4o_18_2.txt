{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: The description of Jason contains several traits and preferences that are more commonly associated with computer science professionals (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles). Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, a Bayesian approach to probability can be considered. Combining the prior probability with the evidence in the description, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Hence, a probability of 0.75 is a reasonable estimate.
