{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the profile typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports the hypothesis that he is more likely to be in the field of computer science. However, since there is a larger number of humanities professors (75) compared to computer science professors (25) in the sample, this must be taken into account.

To calculate the probability more formally, we can use Bayes' theorem, but given the heuristic nature of the description and the evidence provided, a probability of 0.75 seems reasonable. This reflects a strong inclination towards Jason being a computer science professor while still acknowledging the larger proportion of humanities professors in the sample.
