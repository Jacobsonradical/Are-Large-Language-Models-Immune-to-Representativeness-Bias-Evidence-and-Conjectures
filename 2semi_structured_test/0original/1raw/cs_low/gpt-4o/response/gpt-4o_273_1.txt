{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from the fact that Jason's traits and interests, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, align more closely with the typical interests and activities of computer science professors. Additionally, the initial ratios of professors in the study (25 computer science vs. 75 humanities) suggest a base probability of 0.25 for any professor being from computer science. However, the described traits significantly increase the likelihood that Jason is from the computer science group.
