To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem relates current to prior probabilities, specifically:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason's personality description.

Here's a breakdown of the components:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) since 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor) is influenced by his interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, so let's assume it's high, say 0.9.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor) is likely lower due to less emphasis on coding and mathematical problems typically, so let's assign it a lower value,
