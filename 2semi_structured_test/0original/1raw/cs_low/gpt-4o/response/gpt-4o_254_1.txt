To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)): \[\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(Hu)): \[\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

Next, we should consider the likelihoods:
- The probability of having a description like Jason's given that the professor is from computer science (P(D|CS)).
- The probability of having a description like Jason's given that the professor is from the humanities (P(D|Hu)).

Given Jason's description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more likely to be characteristics of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without specific data, we might assume rough proportional values subjectively. Typically, let's say:

- P(D|CS) = 0.9 (90% likely given his characteristics)
- P(D|Hu) = 0.1 (10% likely given his characteristics)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}\]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of
