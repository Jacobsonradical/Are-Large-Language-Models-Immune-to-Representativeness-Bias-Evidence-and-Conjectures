To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll employ Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us infer the probability of a hypothesis given the observed evidence.

Given:
- 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.

Let:
- \( CS \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description of Jason.

We seek \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) require subjective estimates based on Jason's characteristics. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (more typical for computer science), we may estimate that:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively
