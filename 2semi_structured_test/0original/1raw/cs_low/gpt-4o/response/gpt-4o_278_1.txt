To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the base rates and the evidence provided in the description.

1. **Base Rates:**
   - \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood of Description Given the Groups:**
We need to judge how likely the personality description provided fits into each group based on common expectations about characteristics typically associated with computer science professors and humanities professors.

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- He is conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing.

The hobbies and interests (coding, mathematical puzzles) and his personality traits fit more commonly with the stereotype of a computer science professor.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Prof}) = \text{High} \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities Prof}) = \text{Low} \)

For simplicity, let's assign these conditional probabilities based on the strong alignment with stereotypes:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Prof}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}| \text{Human
