Based on the description provided for Jason, several traits and hobbies such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly indicative of a computer science professor. Although there are fewer computer science professors (25) than humanities professors (75) in the study, the specific traits and interests mentioned align more strongly with what is typically expected of a computer science professor.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25, while the prior for a humanities professor is 75/100 = 0.75. Given the description, the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor is higher.

Given these conditions, I will provide a subjective probability based on the description provided and the context of the study.
