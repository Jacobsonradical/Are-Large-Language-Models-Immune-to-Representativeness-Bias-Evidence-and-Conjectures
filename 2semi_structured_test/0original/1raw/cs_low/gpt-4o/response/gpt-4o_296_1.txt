{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived using Bayesian reasoning. Given the characteristics of Jason, particularly his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he would belong to the group of computer science professors rather than humanities professors. However, the fact that there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample (75 vs. 25) must also be taken into account. Therefore, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.25, while the prior probability of him being a humanities professor is 0.75.

Balancing these prior probabilities with the strong indications from Jason's preferences, a relatively higher posterior probability (0.75) that he is a computer science professor seems reasonable.
