To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science \( P(CS) \) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Similarly, the probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities \( P(HS) \) is:
   \[
   P(HS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to assess how likely it is that a description like Jason's would come from a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and not enjoying drawing or writing), it seems more typical for a computer science professor.

   Let's denote these characteristics as \( E \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:
   \[
   P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
   \]

   where:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|HS) \cdot P(HS)
   \]

   Since Jason's
