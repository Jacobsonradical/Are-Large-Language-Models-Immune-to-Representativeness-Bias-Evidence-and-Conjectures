Given the provided description of Jason and understanding his interests and traits, the probability calculation involves considering both the base rate probability and the traits described.

1. **Base rate probability:** 
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - The base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Traits and Interests:**
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.
   - His lack of interest in drawing or writing might suggest a lesser likelihood of being in the humanities.
   
Thus, given these traits, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Incorporating this context, the probability should be adjusted upwards from the base rate.

An appropriate estimate might be in the range of 0.70.

So, the response is:

```json
{"probability": "0.70"}
```
