{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the thought process behind this answer:

Given that we have two groups:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

This means there are 100 professors in total.

The description of Jason mentions a number of characteristics and activities:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, both of which are more commonly associated with computer science.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing, potentially less aligned with the humanities.

Given these characteristics, one might reasonably infer that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

Applying Bayes' theorem to incorporate both the prior probability (the base rate of each category) and the likelihood given Jason's description would support a higher probability for computer science.

The initial probability P(CS) for a professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25, and for humanities P(H) is 75/100 = 0.75.

Given Jasonâ€™s described interests aligning more closely with traits typically associated with computer science, we can reasonably assert that he is more likely one of the 25 computer science professors, despite the higher count of humanities professors.

I'm weighting this analysis by approximately three times the base probability of computer science to account for the alignment with Jason's profile, leading to:

P(CS|Jason)=P(Jason|CS) * P(CS)/P(Jason) 

This is approximated by increasing the initial base probability by a factor reflecting the reasonable fit,
