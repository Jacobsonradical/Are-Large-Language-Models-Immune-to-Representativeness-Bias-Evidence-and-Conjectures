{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, several factors point towards him being more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Specifically, his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his conservative and careful nature, are traits commonly associated with computer science professionals. While his creativity is noted, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further suggests that he might not be in the humanities field, where these skills might be more relevant.

To be more precise in the probability calculation, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, for simplicity and based on the given description, an estimation of 0.75 reflects a higher likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
