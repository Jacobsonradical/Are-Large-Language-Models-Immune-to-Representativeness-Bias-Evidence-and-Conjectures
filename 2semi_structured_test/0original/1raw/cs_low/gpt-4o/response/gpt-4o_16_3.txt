{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability estimate is made based on the description of Jason's interests (coding and solving mathematical puzzles) and conservative personality traits, which are generally more associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. However, note that this assessment includes some degree of subjective judgment and is not strictly grounded in statistical analysis of the entire dataset.
