{"probability": "0.6"}

Explanation:
Given the description of Jason, several factors point towards him being a computer science professor: 

1. Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles – These activities are more closely associated with the field of computer science.
2. Does not enjoy drawing or writing – These activities are typically more aligned with the humanities.

While there are more tenured humanities professors in the sample (75 vs. 25), Jason's interests and activities fit the profile of a computer science professor more closely. Hence, I estimate a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor, although it is not overwhelming due to the larger number of humanities professors in the sample.
