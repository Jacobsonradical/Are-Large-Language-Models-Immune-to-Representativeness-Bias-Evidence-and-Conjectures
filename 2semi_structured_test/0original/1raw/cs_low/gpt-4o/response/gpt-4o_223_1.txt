To address the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. This formula allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

From the description, Jason's interests and traits align more closely with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) compared to a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(HUM) \) as the prior probability Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc|CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc|HUM) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)} \]

We assume that the traits mentioned (coding, mathematical
