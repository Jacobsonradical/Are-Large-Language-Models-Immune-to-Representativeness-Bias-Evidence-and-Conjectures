To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should employ Bayesian reasoning, taking into account prior probabilities and likelihoods based on his description. Here's the calculation based upon the given information:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Based on the description, Jason seems to have characteristics that might be more common among computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles).
   - We need to qualitatively assess the likelihood of the given description among computer science and humanities professors.

For simplicity, let’s assume the following:
- Probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description is higher than that of a humanities professor. Let’s assign reasonable estimates:
   - Likelihood of the description given it’s a computer science professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \)
   - Likelihood of the description given it’s a humanities professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \)

3. **Bayesian Update**:
   By applying Bayes’ theorem:
   \[
   P(\text
