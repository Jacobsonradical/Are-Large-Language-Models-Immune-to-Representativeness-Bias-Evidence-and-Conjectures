{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this probability estimate is as follows: 
1. 25% of the sample (25 out of 100 professors) are from computer science, and 75% are from the humanities.
2. The description of Jason includes many traits and interests that are often associated with computer science, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
3. While it is possible for someone in the humanities to have these interests, they are more stereotypically linked to individuals in the computer science field.
4. Therefore, taking into account the base rates as well as the specific descriptors that align more closely with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor, I estimated the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be 0.75.
