To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given is of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given the total number of professors, 25 are computer science professors and 75 are humanities professors. Therefore:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description suggests characteristics more commonly associated with computer science (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), so let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood since Jason's interests align with computer science).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood since Jason's interests are less typical for a humanities professor).

Next, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) +
