{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the principle known as the base rate fallacy. Because the description provided is more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor's interests (coding, mathematical puzzles), one might be inclined to overestimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. However, considering the actual base rates provided in the study (25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors), the base rate must be heavily factored into the estimate.

Given the personality traits that align more closely with computer science, I've adjusted upwards but still strongly consider the higher base rate of humanities professors.
