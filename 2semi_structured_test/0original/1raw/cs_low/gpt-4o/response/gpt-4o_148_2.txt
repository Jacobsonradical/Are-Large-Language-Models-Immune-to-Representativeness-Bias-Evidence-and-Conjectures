{"probability": "0.25"}

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability that any randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is 0.25 (since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science). While Jason's interests and traits align more closely with those typically associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), applying the base rate provides a balanced way to account for the initial distribution, so the probability remains 0.25.
