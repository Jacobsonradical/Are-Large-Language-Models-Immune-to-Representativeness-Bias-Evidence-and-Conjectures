Given the description of Jason, we need to assess the likelihood that he is one of the computer science professors as opposed to one from the humanities. To do this, we should consider the prior probabilities as well as the specific details in Jason's profile that indicate his field.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - The base rate probability (prior) of a professor being in computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The base rate probability of a professor being in the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Profile details:**
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely associated with computer science.
   - Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities.

Based on these considerations, Jason's profile characteristics fit more naturally with the traits of a computer science professor. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors increases from the base rate.

Let's estimate this updated probability, keeping in mind that the base rate probability was 0.25.

Given Jason's preferences, let's make a reasonable estimate that aligns closer with a computer science professor. For argumentâ€™s sake, we might say this information makes it 3 times more likely that he is a computer science professor compared to his chance based
