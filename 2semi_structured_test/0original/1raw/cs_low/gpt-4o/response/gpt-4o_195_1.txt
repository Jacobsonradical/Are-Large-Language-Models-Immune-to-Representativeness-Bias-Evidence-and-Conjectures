{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's my reasoning: 
Given that there are more professors from the humanities (75) compared to computer science (25), the prior probability of picking a description of a computer science professor at random is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \). However, the description of Jason aligns more closely with the typical interests and attributes of a computer science professor (such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) than those typically associated with humanities professors. This prior probability update suggests that the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor is significantly higher than just the base rate. Given these considerations, a reasonably higher probability, such as 0.75, reflects this adjusted likelihood.
