Based on the given description, it appears that Jason has interests and traits (such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) that are more commonly associated with computer science. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor could be considered higher. 

To make an approximate calculation, let's apply Bayes' Theorem:

1. We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
2. Prior probability (base rate):
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. Likelihood:
   - Given the description, it's reasonable to assume that these traits are more likely found among computer science professors. If we assign a higher likelihood ratio to Jason being a computer science professor given his traits, say 90% for CS and 10% for H (this is a subjective estimation based on the traits).

Applying these values:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.90 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.10 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \cd
