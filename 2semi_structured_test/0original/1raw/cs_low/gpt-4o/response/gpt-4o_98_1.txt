{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of picking a computer science professor at random is 0.25 (25 out of 100). However, Jason's interests and activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are strongly associated with computer science. Based on this profile match, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor despite the initial base rate. Adjusting this probability based on the profile fit leads to a higher probability estimate, such as 0.75.
