To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description of his personality and interests, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we'll assess the likelihood based on the provided information.

First, some relevant numbers:
- Total number of professors = 25 (computer science) + 75 (humanities) = 100
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor, P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor, P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

We will assume that the likelihood of Jason having interests and personality traits described, given he is a computer science professor, is higher than for a humanities professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science.

Let's assume:
- P(Description | CS) = 0.9 (high probability he fits this description given he is in computer science)
- P(Description | Hum) = 0.1 (low probability he fits this description given he is in humanities)

We want to calculate P(CS | Description). Using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}\]

where

\[P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times
