{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is derived by considering both the base rates of the two groups and the description provided. The base rate shows there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the initial probability of being a computer science professor 0.25 and a humanities professor 0.75. However, Jason's description closely aligns with traits commonly associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), which increases the likelihood that he falls into that category. Therefore, factoring in the likelihood based on the description, a reasonable estimate would bring the probability closer to 0.75 for Jason being a computer science professor.
