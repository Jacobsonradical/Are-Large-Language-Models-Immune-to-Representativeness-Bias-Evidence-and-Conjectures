{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the details in the description, Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more closely with typical activities of a computer science professor than a professor in the humanities. This alignment suggests a higher probability that Jason is among the computer science professors.

However, we also must consider the base rates: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. To calculate the probability:

- Let \( P(CS) \) be the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(Description | CS) \) be the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(Hum) \) be the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( P(Description | Hum) \) be the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( P(Description) \) be the total probability of the description occurring, which combines both groups.

We need to use Bayes' Theorem for this calculation:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

To avoid complex calculations without detailed probabilities, we use qualitative judgment and adjust accordingly. Given coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators for computer science and significantly less so for humanities:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
-
