Given the description of Jason, let's consider the characteristics and interests mentioned:

1. Jason enjoys coding.
2. He likes solving mathematical puzzles.
3. He enjoys jogging.
4. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These traits seem to align more closely with a computer science professor than a humanities professor, particularly the interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, we can simplify our calculation using the numbers provided and the description that fits better with computer science:

- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.

Let's denote:
- CS: Jason is a computer science professor.
- H: Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the attributes and interests described, it's reasonable to assume that someone with such a profile would be more likely found among the computer science professors. Let's assign higher likelihood to this scenario.

Based on the prior probabilities:
P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given the description aligns more closely with the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we increase the likelihood for CS more than H, without exact figures to use.

It's reasonable (though somewhat conservative) to estimate:
P(description|CS) â‰ˆ 0.80 (high
