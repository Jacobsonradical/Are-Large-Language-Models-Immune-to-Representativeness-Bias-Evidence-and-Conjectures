To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which requires consideration of both the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood of observing the given description among both groups of professors.

We have two groups:
- Computer science professors: 25
- Humanities professors: 75

Thus, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(H)\)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) and the likelihood of the same description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)). Jason's interests and personality traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, along with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, seem to align more closely with typical computer science activities.

While exact likelihood values are not given, we can reasonably estimate that the likelihood (\(P(D|CS)\)) is higher for the computer science group compared to the humanities group.

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = x \]
\[ P(D|H) = y \]
