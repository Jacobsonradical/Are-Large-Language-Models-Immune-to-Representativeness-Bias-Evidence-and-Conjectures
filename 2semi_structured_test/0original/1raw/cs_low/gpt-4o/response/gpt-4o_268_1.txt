{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is based on the fact that Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and personality traits (talented, ambitious, highly creative but not interested in drawing or writing) are more commonly associated with the field of computer science compared to the humanities. Additionally, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, meaning that base rates must also be considered. Computing the probabilities using Bayes' theorem gives a higher posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor.
