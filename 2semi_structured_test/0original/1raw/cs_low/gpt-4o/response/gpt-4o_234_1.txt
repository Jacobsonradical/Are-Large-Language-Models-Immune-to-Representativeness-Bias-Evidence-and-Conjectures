Given the description of Jason and the context provided, the relevant information to consider is his interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These hobbies are strongly indicative of a background in computer science rather than the humanities. 

Bayes' Theorem can be used to make a more informed estimate. Let's denote:
- \(C\) as Jason being a computer science professor
- \(H\) as Jason being a humanities professor

We are given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

While creating a simplistic estimation, let's assume the probability of enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is high for a computer science professor and very low for a humanities professor. Thus:
- \(P(\text{description} | C) \approx 1\) (Assuming almost all computer science professors match such interests)
- \(P(\text{description} | H) \approx 0\) (Assuming few humanities professors match such interests)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}\]

Given:
\[P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cd
