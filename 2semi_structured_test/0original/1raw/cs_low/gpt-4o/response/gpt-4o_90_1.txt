Let's analyze the information given and calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote the following:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a professor is in Computer Science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a professor is in the Humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in Computer Science.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in the Humanities.
- \( P(CS|D) \): Probability that a professor is in Computer Science given the description.

We have:
- Total number of professors = 100
- Number of Computer Science professors = 25
- Number of Humanities professors = 75

So:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given Jason's description, it seems more consistent with the traits typically associated with a Computer Science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not interested in drawing or writing) than with a Humanities professor. Without
