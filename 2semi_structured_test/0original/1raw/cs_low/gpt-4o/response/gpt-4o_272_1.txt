To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, forming a total of 100 professors.

Given Jason's profile, the traits mentioned (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, creative but doesn't enjoy writing or drawing) seem to align more closely with typical interests and skills associated with computer science than with the humanities.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need the probability \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming the description is more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor, let's estimate:
\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \):
\[ P
