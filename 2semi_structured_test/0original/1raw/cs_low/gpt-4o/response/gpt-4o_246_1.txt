Let's analyze the given information and use the principle of base rates to determine the probability.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description of Jason fits some common traits that might be more closely associated with a computer science professor, such as enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. As such, the specific description given (enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles) likely increases the conditional probability.

Given this, let's adjust the probability slightly in favor of Jason being a computer science professor, while also recognizing our initial base rate.

Including both the base rate and the specific information, a reasonable estimate might be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
