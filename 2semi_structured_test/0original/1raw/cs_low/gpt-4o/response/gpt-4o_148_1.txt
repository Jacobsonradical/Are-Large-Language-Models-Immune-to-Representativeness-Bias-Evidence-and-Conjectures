To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, let's consider the available information:

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   
2. The description of Jason suggests interests and traits that are potentially more aligned with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than humanities (e.g., drawing or writing).

Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute this probability. Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the provided description.

We need to determine the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a description fits a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that a description fits a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description aligns more closely with traits typical of a computer science professor, we can assume:
- \( P(B|A
