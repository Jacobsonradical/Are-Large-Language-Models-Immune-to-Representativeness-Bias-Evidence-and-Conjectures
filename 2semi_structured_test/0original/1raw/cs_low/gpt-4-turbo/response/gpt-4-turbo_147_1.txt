To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on his description, we must consider the information given and how it may align with either of the groups: computer science professors or humanities professors.

From Jason's description:
- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities closely associated with the field of computer science.
- His interests do not include typical humanities pursuits like drawing or writing.
- Additionally, typical activities and hobbies can sometimes, but not always, align with professional interests.

Given that 25 of the 100 professors are from computer science, the base rate that any randomly chosen professor from this study is from computer science is 0.25. However, Jason's specific interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a higher likelihood of being associated with computer science rather than the humanities. This alignment with stereotypical computer science activities increases the probability that he is from the computer science group beyond the base rate.

Considering this information and adjusting the base probability:

{"probability": "0.85"}
