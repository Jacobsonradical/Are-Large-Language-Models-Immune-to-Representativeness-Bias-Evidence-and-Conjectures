{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has strong analytical skills and interests, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty.
