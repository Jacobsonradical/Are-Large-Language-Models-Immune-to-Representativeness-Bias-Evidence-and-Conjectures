{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could suggest that he is not in the humanities field. However, this is still a probability, and not a certainty, as there could be humanities professors with similar interests.
