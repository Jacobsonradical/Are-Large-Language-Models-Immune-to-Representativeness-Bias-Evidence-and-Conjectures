{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing could indicate that he is less likely to be in a humanities field. However, it's important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there is a possibility that a professor in the humanities could also have these traits.
