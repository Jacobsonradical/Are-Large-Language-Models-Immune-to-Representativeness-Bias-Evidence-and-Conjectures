{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the typical interests of a computer science professor. While this is not definitive proof, it suggests a higher probability that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is an estimation based on limited information, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
