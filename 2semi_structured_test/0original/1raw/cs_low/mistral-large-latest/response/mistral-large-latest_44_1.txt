{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason mentions his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. His disinterest in drawing and writing also aligns more with the stereotypical image of computer scientists compared to humanities professors. However, it's important to note that this is only a probability based on the information given, and there are certainly humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematics.
