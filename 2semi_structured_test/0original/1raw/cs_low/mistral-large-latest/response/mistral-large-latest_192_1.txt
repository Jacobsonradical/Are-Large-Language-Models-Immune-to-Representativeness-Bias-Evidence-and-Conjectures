{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more with the interests of a computer science professor. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may suggest a preference for technical and logical tasks rather than artistic or literary pursuits. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be 0.8.
