{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might indicate less interest in humanities. However, the description does not provide any information about his teaching or research interests, so there is still some uncertainty. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.75.
