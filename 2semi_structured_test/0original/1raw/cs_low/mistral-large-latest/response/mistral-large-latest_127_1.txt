{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. While creativity is important in many fields, including the humanities, Jason's lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate that he is less likely to be a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and that there is still a possibility that Jason is a humanities professor with unique interests.
