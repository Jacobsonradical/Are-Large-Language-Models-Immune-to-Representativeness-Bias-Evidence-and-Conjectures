{"probability": "0.8"}

The given description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Despite being highly creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more associated with the humanities. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, the probability is not 100% certain since there might be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
