{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Although the description does not provide any direct evidence that he is a humanities professor, the absence of any mentioned interest in humanities subjects slightly increases the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. Additionally, being highly creative does not necessarily mean that he is a humanities professor, as creativity is also valuable in computer science. However, since we do not have information about the distribution of personality traits among successful professors in both fields, this probability is still somewhat uncertain.
