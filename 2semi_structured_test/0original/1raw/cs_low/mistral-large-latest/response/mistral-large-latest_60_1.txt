{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong inclination towards logical and mathematical tasks, as well as coding, which are traits more commonly associated with computer science professors. However, since the study includes both computer science and humanities professors, and the description does not provide any information about his teaching or research interests, it is not possible to be completely certain that Jason is a computer science professor. Therefore, I would estimate the probability to be 0.8, indicating a high likelihood but not absolute certainty.
