{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. While his enjoyment of jogging and lack of interest in drawing and writing don't necessarily indicate a specific field, his conservative, careful, and ambitious nature may also be more common among computer science professors, as these traits could be beneficial for the systematic and meticulous nature of the field. However, it's important to note that these are just probabilities and not definitive proof, as personality traits can vary greatly among individuals in both computer science and humanities fields.
