{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason as a conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing also supports this hypothesis. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and that there is still a possibility that Jason is a humanities professor with an atypical set of interests.
