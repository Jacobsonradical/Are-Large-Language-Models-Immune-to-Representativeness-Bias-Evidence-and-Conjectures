{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing could indicate that he is less likely to be in a humanities field. However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate based on the limited information provided, and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who has a strong interest in coding and mathematics as hobbies.
