{"probability": "0.7"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might suggest a preference for the logical and analytical nature of computer science over the more subjective and expressive nature of the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, as there are also individuals in the humanities who might enjoy coding and mathematics.
