{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills closely associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may indicate a preference for technical tasks over creative tasks in the humanities. However, the probability isn't 1 because there's no definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor â€“ some humanities professors may also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.
