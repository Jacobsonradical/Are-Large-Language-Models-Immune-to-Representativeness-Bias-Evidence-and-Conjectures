{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's hobbies, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are common activities in the humanities, further supports this conclusion. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests.
