{"probability": "0.7"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be associated with the humanities.

Therefore, the probability is higher than 0.5, but not extremely high, reflecting the uncertainty based on the information given.
