{"probability": "0.8"}

The description provides some clues that suggest Jason might be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, as there can be exceptions and overlaps in interests and activities between different academic fields.
