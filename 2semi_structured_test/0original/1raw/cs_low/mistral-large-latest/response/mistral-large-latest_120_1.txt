{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this. However, it's important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty, as individuals in the humanities can also have these interests.
