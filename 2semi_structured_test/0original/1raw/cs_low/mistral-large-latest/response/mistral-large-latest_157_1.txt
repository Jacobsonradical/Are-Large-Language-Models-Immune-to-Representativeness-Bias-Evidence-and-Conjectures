{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also leans more towards the quantitative and analytical nature of computer science, as opposed to the more qualitative and creative nature of the humanities. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is not a guarantee, hence the probability is less than 1.
