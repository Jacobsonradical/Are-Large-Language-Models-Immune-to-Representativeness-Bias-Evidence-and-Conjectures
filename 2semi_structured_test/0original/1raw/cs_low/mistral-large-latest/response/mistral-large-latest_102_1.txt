{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's personality and interests suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles are common traits among computer science professors, while his lack of interest in drawing or writing might indicate less of a focus on the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
