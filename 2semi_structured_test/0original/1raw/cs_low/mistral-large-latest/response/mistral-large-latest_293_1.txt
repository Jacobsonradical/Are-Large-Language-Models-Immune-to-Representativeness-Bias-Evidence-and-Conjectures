{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Although creativity is a trait that can be found in both computer science and humanities professors, Jason's disinterest in drawing and writing makes it less likely that he belongs to the humanities field. Additionally, the sample size of computer science professors is smaller (25), so the probability should not be too high to account for that. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.75.
