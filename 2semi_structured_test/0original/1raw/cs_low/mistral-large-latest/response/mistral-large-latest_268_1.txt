{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, the probability is not 100% certain because personality traits and interests alone do not definitively determine a person's academic field. Additionally, the sample size of computer science professors is smaller than that of humanities professors, which may also affect the probability.
