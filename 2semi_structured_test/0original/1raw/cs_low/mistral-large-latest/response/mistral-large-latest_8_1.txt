The description of Jason suggests a strong inclination towards logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits among computer science professors. However, the absence of interest in drawing or writing does not necessarily rule out the possibility of him being a humanities professor, as humanities also encompass a wide range of subjects beyond creative writing and art. Nonetheless, based on the given information, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
