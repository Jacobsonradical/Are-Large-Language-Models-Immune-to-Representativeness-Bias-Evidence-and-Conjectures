{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong inclination towards logical and mathematical activities, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical and abstract tasks, which are more commonly found in computer science than in the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities with a unique set of interests.
