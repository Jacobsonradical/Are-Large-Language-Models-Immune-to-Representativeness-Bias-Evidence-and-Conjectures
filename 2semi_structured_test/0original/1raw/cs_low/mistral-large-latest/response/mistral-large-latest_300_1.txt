{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits suggests that he may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and lack of interest in drawing or writing are characteristics that might be more common among computer science professors. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there may be humanities professors who share these traits as well.
