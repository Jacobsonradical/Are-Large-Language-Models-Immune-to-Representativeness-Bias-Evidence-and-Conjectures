{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, several traits and interests align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are common among computer science professionals. His lack of interest in drawing and writing could also indicate a stronger preference for the logical and analytical aspects of computer science as opposed to the more creative aspects of the humanities. However, it is important to note that the description does not provide any direct information about Jason's academic background or field of study, so there is still a possibility that he is a humanities professor. Thus, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.85.
