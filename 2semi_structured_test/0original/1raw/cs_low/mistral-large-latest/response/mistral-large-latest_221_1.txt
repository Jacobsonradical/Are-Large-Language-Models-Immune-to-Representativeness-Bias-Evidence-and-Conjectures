{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities commonly associated with the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who has a strong interest in coding and mathematics.
