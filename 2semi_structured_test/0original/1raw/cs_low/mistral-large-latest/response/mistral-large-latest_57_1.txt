{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities that are more commonly associated with computer science than with the humanities. His preference for these activities over drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities, also supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and that there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who happens to enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.
