{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the information given, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skills and tasks typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing further supports the idea that he may be more likely to be in the computer science field rather than the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematics.
