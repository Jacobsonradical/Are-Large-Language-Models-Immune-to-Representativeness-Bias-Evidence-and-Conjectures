{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities typically associated with humanities professors. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it is not a certainty, hence the probability of 0.8.
