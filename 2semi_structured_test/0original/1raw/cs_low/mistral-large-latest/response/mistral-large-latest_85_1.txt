{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is likely a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is not definitive evidence and there is still a possibility that he could be a professor in the humanities with a strong interest in coding and mathematics. Therefore, I would assign a probability of 0.75 to the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.
