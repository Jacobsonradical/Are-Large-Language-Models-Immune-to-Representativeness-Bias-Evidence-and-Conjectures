{"probability": "0.8"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also aligns more with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it's not a certainty, hence the probability of 0.8.
