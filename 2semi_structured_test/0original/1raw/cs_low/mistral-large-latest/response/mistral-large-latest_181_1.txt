{"probability": "0.7"}

Explanation: Based on the information given, Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is just a probability and not a certainty, as there could be humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematics.
