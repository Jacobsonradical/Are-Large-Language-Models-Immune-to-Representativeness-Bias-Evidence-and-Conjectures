{"probability": "0.8"}

The description suggests that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be activities more commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, it seems more probable that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, this is still a probability, not a certainty.
