{"probability": "0.8"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be seen as less related to the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and math.
