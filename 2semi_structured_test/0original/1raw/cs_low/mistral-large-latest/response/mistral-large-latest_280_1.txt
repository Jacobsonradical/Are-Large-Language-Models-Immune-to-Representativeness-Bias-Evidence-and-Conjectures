{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing makes it less likely that he is a humanities professor. However, since the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate of computer science professors is lower. Thus, I assigned a probability of 0.8, indicating that while it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor, there is still some uncertainty due to the sample composition.
