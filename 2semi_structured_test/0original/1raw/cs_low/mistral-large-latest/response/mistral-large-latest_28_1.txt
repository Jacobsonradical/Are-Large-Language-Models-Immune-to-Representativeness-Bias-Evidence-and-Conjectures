{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate that his creativity is more analytical than artistic. However, it's important to note that personality traits alone cannot definitively determine an individual's field of expertise, and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a professor in the humanities. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.75, or 75%.
