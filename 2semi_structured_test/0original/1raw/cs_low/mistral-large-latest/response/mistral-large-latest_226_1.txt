{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests that he is more likely to be a professor in computer science rather than the humanities. However, the probability is not 100% certain because there is still a chance that a humanities professor could have similar interests and traits.
