{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the information given, Jason seems to have a strong interest in logical and mathematical activities, such as coding and solving puzzles. These interests align more closely with the field of computer science than with the humanities. Additionally, while creativity is valued in both fields, Jason's disinterest in drawing and writing, which are common creative outlets in the humanities, further suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, since personality traits do not perfectly determine one's academic field, the probability is not 1.
