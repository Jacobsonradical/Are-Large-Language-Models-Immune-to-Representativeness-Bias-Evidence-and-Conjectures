{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, since the study includes both computer science and humanities professors, and the sample size of computer science professors is smaller (25 out of 100), the probability is not 100%.
