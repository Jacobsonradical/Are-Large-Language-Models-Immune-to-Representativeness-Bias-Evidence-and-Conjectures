{"probability": "0.8"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate a less strong interest in humanities subjects. However, the description does not provide any direct information about Jason's profession, so it is impossible to be completely certain. The probability of 0.8 is a reasonable estimate based on the available information.
