{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, since personality traits do not perfectly determine a person's field of study, there is still a small probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
