{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science professors. The fact that he is not interested in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, since the description does not provide any information about his teaching or research interests, it is still possible that he is a professor in the humanities with a background or interest in mathematics or computer science. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be 0.8.
