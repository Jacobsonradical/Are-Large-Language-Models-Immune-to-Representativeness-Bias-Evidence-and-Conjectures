{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities that involve logic and problem-solving, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate a lower likelihood of him being a humanities professor. However, the probability is not 1 because personality traits alone cannot determine a person's academic field with absolute certainty.
