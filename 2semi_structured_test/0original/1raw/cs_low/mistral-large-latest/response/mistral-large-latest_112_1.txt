{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, align more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors. Additionally, his dislike for drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it's important to note that this is a probability based on stereotypical traits and interests, and there is a possibility that Jason could be a professor in the humanities with these traits.
