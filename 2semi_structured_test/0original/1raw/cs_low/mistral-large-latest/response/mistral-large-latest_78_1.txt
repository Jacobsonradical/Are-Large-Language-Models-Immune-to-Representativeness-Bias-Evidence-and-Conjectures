{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be considered more associated with the humanities. However, it's not guaranteed that Jason is a computer science professor, hence the probability is not 1.
