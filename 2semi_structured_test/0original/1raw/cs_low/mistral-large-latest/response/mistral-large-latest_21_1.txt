{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more with the skillset and hobbies expected of a computer science professor. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it's important to acknowledge that a humanities professor could also have these traits and interests, so the probability is not 100%.
