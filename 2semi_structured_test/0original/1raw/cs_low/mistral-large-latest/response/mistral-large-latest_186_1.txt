{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, this is not a certainty, as there may be humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles. Therefore, I would estimate the probability to be 0.8, indicating that it is relatively likely but not guaranteed that Jason is a computer science professor.
