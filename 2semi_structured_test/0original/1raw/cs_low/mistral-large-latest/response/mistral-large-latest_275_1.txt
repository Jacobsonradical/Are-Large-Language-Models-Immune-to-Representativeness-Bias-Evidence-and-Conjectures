{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate a lower likelihood of being a humanities professor. However, the probability is not 1 because personality traits alone cannot perfectly predict a person's field of expertise.
