{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the information given, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a strong inclination towards a technical field like computer science. Moreover, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption, as these activities are more commonly associated with the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is still an assumption, as there are also computer science professors who may enjoy drawing or writing, and humanities professors who enjoy coding or solving mathematical puzzles. Therefore, while the probability is high, it is not absolutely certain.
