{"probability": "0.75"}

The given description of Jason suggests that he has a strong inclination towards coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical and analytical tasks over creative or humanities-based pursuits. Based on this information, I would estimate that there is a 75% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on limited information and should be interpreted with caution.
