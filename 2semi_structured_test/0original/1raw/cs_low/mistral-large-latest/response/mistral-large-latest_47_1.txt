{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles seem more aligned with a computer science professor's profile. However, there is still a possibility that a humanities professor may have similar interests, hence the probability is not 1. Additionally, the sample size of computer science professors is smaller, which also factors into the probability calculation.
