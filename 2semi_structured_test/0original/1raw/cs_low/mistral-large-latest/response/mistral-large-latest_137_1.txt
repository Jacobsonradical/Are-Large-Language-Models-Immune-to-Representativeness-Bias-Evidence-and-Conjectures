{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. His interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a preference for technical and logical tasks, which are more commonly associated with computer science than with the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and that there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor, as personality traits and interests can vary widely within both fields.
