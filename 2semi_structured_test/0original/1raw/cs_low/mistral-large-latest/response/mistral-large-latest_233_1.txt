{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities that are more analytical and logical, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, rather than creative activities like drawing or writing. This preference for analytical tasks, along with his ambition and talent, may make it more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is just a probability and that there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
