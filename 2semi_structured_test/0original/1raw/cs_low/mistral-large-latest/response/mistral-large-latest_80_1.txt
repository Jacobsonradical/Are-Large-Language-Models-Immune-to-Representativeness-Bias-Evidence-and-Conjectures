{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be perceived as less related to the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, as there are successful professors in humanities who enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and successful computer science professors who enjoy drawing or writing. The probability is based on the information given and common stereotypes about the interests of professors in computer science and the humanities.
