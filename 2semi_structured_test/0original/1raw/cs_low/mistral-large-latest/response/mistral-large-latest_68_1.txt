{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Although the description does not provide direct evidence of his academic field, his interests and personality traits, such as being talented, ambitious, and enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, since the description does not provide any information about his teaching or research activities, the probability is not 100%.
