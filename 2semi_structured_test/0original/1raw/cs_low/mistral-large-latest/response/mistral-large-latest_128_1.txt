{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may suggest that he is less likely to be a professor in the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be computer science professors who do not enjoy coding or mathematical puzzles, and humanities professors who do.
