{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, aligns more closely with the skills and hobbies typically associated with computer science professors. Furthermore, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may suggest that he is less likely to be a humanities professor, although this is not definitive. It is important to note that this is only a probability and individual personalities may not perfectly align with their chosen field of study.
