{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, based on this information, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.
