{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests that Jason has strong analytical and technical skills, as evidenced by his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These traits are commonly found in successful computer science professors. Therefore, I would estimate a 75% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only an estimation, and individual personality traits do not always align perfectly with professional fields.
