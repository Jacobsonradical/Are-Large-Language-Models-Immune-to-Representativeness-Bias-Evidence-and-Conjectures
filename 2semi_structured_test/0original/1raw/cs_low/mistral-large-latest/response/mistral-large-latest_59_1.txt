{"probability": "0.8"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills closely associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing makes it less likely that he is a professor in the humanities. However, since the study includes both computer science and humanities professors, it is not certain that Jason is a computer science professor, hence the probability is not 1.
