{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits suggests a strong affinity for logical and analytical activities, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. While these traits may be found in both computer science and humanities professors, they are more commonly associated with computer science. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be 0.8. However, it is important to note that this is just an estimate based on the information provided, and individual cases may vary.
