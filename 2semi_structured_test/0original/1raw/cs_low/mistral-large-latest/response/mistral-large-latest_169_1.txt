{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, it is mentioned that despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could suggest a preference for more technical and logical tasks rather than creative and expressive tasks often associated with humanities. However, it is important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.
