{"probability": "0.75"}

The given description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be activities typically associated with humanities professors. However, personality traits alone cannot determine a person's field of expertise with absolute certainty, hence the probability is not 1.
