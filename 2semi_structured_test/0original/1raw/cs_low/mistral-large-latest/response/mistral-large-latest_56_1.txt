{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate that he is less likely to be a professor in the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and mathematics.
