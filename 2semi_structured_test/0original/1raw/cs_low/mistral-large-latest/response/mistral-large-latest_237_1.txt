{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skill set and interests of a computer science professor. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also supports this assumption. While it is not impossible for a humanities professor to have these traits, the probability seems higher that Jason is a computer science professor. However, this is still a probability and not a certainty, as personality traits do not always perfectly correlate with one's field of expertise.
