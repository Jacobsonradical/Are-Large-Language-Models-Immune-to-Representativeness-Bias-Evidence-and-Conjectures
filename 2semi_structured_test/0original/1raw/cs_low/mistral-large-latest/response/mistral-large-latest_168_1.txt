{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated with the field of computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be less relevant to the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also enjoy these activities.
