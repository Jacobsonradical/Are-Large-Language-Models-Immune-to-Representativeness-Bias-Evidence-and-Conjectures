{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may indicate a preference for the logical and analytical nature of computer science over the more subjective and creative nature of the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests and skills.
