{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, this is not a certainty, and there is still a possibility that he could be a professor in the humanities who has a strong interest in coding and mathematics. Hence, the probability is not 1, but rather, a high value of 0.8.
