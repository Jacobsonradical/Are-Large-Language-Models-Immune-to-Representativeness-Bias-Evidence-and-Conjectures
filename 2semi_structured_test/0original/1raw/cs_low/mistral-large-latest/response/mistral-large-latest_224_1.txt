{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. However, since the sample size of computer science professors is smaller (25) compared to humanities professors (75), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is not as high as it might be if the sample sizes were equal. Hence, I would estimate the probability to be around 0.75, reflecting a relatively high but not certain likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.
