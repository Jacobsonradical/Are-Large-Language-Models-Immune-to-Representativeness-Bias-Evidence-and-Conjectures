{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests and traits align more closely with the stereotypical characteristics of a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing and writing, suggest a greater likelihood that he is a professor in computer science rather than the humanities. However, the probability is not 1.0, as there is still a chance that a humanities professor could have these traits and interests.
