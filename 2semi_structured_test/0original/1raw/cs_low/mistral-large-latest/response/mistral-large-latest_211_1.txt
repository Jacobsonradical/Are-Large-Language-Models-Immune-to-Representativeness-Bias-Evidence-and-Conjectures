{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is a methodical and analytical individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These interests align more closely with the field of computer science than with the humanities, hence the higher probability assigned. However, it is important to note that the probability is not 100% as the description does not guarantee that Jason is a computer science professor. There could be professors in the humanities who also have similar interests and traits.
