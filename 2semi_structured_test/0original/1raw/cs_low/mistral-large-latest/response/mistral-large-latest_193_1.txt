{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description provides several clues suggesting that Jason might be a computer science professor. His interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are common in the field of computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are common activities in the humanities, further supports the probability that he is a computer science professor. However, the probability is not 100% because it is possible for a professor in the humanities to have similar interests and traits.
