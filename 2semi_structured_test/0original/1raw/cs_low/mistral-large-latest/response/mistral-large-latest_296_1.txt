{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical or analytical tasks, which are also commonly associated with computer science. While it is certainly possible that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who has an interest in coding and mathematics, the description seems to align more closely with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample to be around 0.8.
