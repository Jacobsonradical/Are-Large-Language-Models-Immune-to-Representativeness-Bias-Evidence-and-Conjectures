{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with the field of computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. While it is possible that a professor in the humanities could have these traits and interests, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, this is still a subjective judgment based on limited information, so the probability is not 100%.
