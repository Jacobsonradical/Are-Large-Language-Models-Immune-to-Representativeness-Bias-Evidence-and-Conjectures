{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills that are typically associated with computer science. Additionally, the fact that he is not interested in drawing or writing, which are activities that are more commonly associated with the humanities, also suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and it is possible that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who has a strong interest in coding and mathematics.
