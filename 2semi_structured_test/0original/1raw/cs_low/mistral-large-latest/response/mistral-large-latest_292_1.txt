{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason's interests, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be humanities professors who also enjoy these activities. Additionally, the sample size of computer science professors is smaller than that of humanities professors, which may also affect the probability.
