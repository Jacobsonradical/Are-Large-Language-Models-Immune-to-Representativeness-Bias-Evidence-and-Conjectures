{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits and interests that align more closely with computer science professors than with humanities professors. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor.
