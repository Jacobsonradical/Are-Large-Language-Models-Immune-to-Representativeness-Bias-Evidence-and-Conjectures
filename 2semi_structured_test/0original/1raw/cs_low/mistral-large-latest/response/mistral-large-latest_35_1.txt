{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, since the study also included humanities professors, it is not impossible for a humanities professor to have these interests. Therefore, I assigned a probability of 0.8 to indicate a high but not absolute certainty that Jason is a computer science professor.
