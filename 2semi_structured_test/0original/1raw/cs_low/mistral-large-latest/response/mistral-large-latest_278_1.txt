{"probability": "0.8"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more associated with the humanities. However, since the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base probability for a random professor being from computer science would be 0.25. Given the information provided, I adjust the probability to 0.8, reflecting a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor.
