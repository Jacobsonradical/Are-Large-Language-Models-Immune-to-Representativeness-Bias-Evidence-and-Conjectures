A study aimed to identify common personality traits among successful academics was conducted. In this study, a panel of professional psychologists interviewed and administered personality tests to 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. Based on these personality tests, descriptions were written for each of the 100 professors.

You will be presented with one such description, chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Here is the description:
Jason is a 45-year-old married man with five children. He is conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing.

Now, please indicate your probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

Please give a number between 0 and 1, and answer the question in the following format:
