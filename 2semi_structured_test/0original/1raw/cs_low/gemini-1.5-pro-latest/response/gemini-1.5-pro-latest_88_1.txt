{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:** Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles strongly suggests an analytical and logical mindset common in computer science.
* **Lack of Arts indicators:**  While not definitive, the lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing, despite being creative, might suggest a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. Personality traits are not exclusive to any profession. There are many creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists who are talented artists.
