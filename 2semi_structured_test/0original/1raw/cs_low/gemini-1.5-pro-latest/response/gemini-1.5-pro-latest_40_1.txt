**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, some key elements lean heavily towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This aligns strongly with the logical and problem-solving skills prevalent in computer science. 

While Jason could be a humanities professor with these interests, they are more common and often considered fundamental in the field of computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. The provided probability reflects a higher likelihood of him being in computer science given the evidence.
