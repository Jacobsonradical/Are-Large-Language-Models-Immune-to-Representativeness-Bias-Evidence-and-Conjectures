{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities, while only 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this group is in the humanities and a 25% chance they are in computer science.
* **Description:** The description leans towards stereotypes we might associate with computer science (coding, math puzzles). However, these are not exclusive to computer science, and the description also mentions creativity and a dislike for drawing/writing, which could be seen as aligning with certain humanities fields.

**Without stronger evidence, it's statistically more likely that Jason falls within the larger group of humanities professors.**  The description alone isn't strong enough to overcome the initial 75% probability.
