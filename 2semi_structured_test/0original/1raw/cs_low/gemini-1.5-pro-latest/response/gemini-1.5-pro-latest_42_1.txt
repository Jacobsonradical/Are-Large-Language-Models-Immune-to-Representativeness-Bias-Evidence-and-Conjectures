{"probability": "0.75"} 

My reasoning:

While the description offers no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it highlights traits and hobbies more commonly associated with computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits can be associated with the meticulous nature of programming.

The description lacks any indicators typically associated with humanities, such as a passion for literature, history, or the arts. 

Therefore, based on the available information and the base rates provided (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors), it's more likely that Jason belongs to the computer science group. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic inference based on limited information and stereotypes. There's a significant chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical hobbies.
