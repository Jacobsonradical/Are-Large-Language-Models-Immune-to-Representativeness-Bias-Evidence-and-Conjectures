**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession from the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the given information to make an educated guess.

* **Prior Probability:**  The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

* **The Description:** The description emphasizes traits often associated with computer science:
    * Enjoys coding
    * Solving mathematical puzzles 

* **Weighing the Evidence:** While the description doesn't rule out Jason being a humanities professor, the highlighted traits suggest a higher likelihood of him being in computer science.

* **Not Definitive:**  It's important to remember that this is still a probability, not a certainty. There are humanities professors who enjoy coding and math puzzles, and there are computer science professors who might not fit the stereotypical mold.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems reasonable given the available information.**
