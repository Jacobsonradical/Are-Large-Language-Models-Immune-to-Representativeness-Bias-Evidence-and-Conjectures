{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on stereotypes, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles:**  Strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative, careful:**  While these traits can be found in any profession, they align with the detail-oriented nature of programming.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:**  Suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  There are many creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic and dislike artistic pursuits. However, given the limited information and the relative prevalence of the listed traits in computer science, a higher probability is assigned to that field.
