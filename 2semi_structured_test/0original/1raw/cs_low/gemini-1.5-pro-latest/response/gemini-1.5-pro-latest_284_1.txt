{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup.  

* **Base Rate:** There's a significantly higher base rate of humanities professors in the study (75) compared to computer science professors (25). This means a randomly chosen professor is three times more likely to be from humanities.
* **Description:** The description does contain elements that might stereotypically align with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles). However, these aren't exclusive to computer science and could apply to some within the humanities as well (e.g., digital humanities, computational linguistics). 

**Without further information that strongly points to computer science, the higher base rate of humanities professors makes it more likely that Jason belongs to that group.** 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. It's not a definitive statement about Jason's profession.
