**Reasoning:**

The description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset commonly found in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits align with the detail-oriented nature of the field.
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical expression over artistic or narrative forms.

While it's possible for a humanities professor to possess some of these traits, the combination strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

**Important Note:** The probability is high but not absolute. There's always a chance Jason's chosen field doesn't strictly align with his personality traits.
