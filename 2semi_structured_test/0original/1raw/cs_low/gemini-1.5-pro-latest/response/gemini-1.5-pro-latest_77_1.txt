{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes and Common Associations:** Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns strongly with common stereotypes associated with computer science.  While these stereotypes aren't always accurate, they do exist for a reason.
* **Sample Size:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly selected professor is three times more likely to be from humanities. However, Jason's description leans heavily towards interests more commonly associated with computer science.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Individual Variation:** Personality traits and hobbies don't perfectly predict someone's profession. There are plenty of humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and coding. 
* **Limited Information:** The description only provides a small glimpse into Jason's personality and interests. 

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the information provided makes it more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors. A probability of 0.75 (or 75%) reflects this higher likelihood, while still acknowledging the possibility that he could be a humanities professor.
