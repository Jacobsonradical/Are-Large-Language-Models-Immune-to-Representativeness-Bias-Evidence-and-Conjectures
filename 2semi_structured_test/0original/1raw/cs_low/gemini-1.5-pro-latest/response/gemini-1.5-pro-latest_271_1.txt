{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided:

* **Prior Probability:** The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a base 25% chance (0.25) that any randomly selected professor is in computer science.

* **Description:** The description highlights several traits often associated with computer science:
    * **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator.
    * **Solving mathematical puzzles:** Also points towards a computer science inclination.

* **Less Strong Indicators:**
    * **Conservative, careful, ambitious:** These traits can be found across many professions and aren't specific to computer science.
    * **Dislikes drawing and writing:** While this might make some humanities fields less likely, it doesn't definitively point to computer science.

**Conclusion:**

The strong indicators (enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles) significantly increase the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor. While we don't have enough to be 100% certain, a probability of **0.75 (75%)** seems reasonable based on the available information.
