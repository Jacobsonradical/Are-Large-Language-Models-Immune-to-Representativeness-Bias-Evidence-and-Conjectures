**Reasoning:**

While there is no information in the description that definitively places Jason in either field, there are strong indicators that make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator for computer science. While some humanities professors might code, it's far more central to computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Again, this is more commonly associated with computer science and related fields. 
* **No enjoyment of drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these are often seen as valuable skills in many humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:**  The provided probability is a subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid drawing definitive conclusions about an individual's profession based solely on personality traits or hobbies.
