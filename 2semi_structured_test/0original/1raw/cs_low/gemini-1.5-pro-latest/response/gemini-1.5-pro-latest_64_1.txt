{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators suggesting he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly aligned with computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less typical compared to computer science.

The other details (age, family status, personality traits) are not particularly informative for determining his field.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  It's entirely possible for someone with Jason's description to be a humanities professor with interests outside their field.
