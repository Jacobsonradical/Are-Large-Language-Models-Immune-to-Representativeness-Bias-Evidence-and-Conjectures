{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively state Jason's profession, it heavily implies he's more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotypes:**  The description emphasizes traits often associated with computer science: logical thinking ("solving mathematical puzzles"), technical skill ("coding"), and a preference for concrete tasks over artistic ones ("enjoys coding... but not drawing or writing").
* **Ambition in a Quantifiable Field:**  "Ambitious" combined with his other traits points towards a field where success is often clearly measurable, like computer science (publications, grants, etc.).

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and potential stereotypes. It's entirely possible for humanities professors to share these traits, and Jason's actual profession is not guaranteed.
