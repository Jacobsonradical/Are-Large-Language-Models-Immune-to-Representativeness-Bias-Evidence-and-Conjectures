**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the emphasis on traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This means the prior probability leans towards humanities.
* **Stereotypical Traits:** The description leans on stereotypical (though not necessarily accurate) associations of computer science with logic, math, and coding. 
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:**  While not disliking drawing or writing doesn't preclude someone from humanities, the description lacks strong indicators of typical humanities interests (e.g., literature, history, philosophy).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor who enjoys coding as a hobby. The answer of 0.75 reflects a higher likelihood, not certainty.
