**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be seen as stereotypically aligning with a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the key to solving this lies in the study's design. 

* **Sample Size Disparity:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. 
* **Random Selection:** You are told the description is chosen randomly from the 100.

This means there's a 75% chance the randomly selected description belongs to a humanities professor and only a 25% chance it belongs to a computer science professor *regardless* of Jason's personal interests. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.
