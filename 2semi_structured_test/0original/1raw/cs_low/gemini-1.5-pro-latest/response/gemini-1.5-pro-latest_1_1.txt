**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study description. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities and only 25 are in computer science. This means there's a higher prior probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities. 
* **Description:** The description offers some hints that might align with stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, math puzzles). However, these are not exclusive to computer science and could apply to individuals in the humanities as well (especially fields like digital humanities or those using computational methods). 

**Without strong evidence to override the base rate, it's more likely that Jason, fitting a somewhat stereotypical but not exclusive profile, is one of the 75 humanities professors.** 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer, not a definitive one.  There's a chance Jason is a computer science professor, but based on the information given, it's less likely.
