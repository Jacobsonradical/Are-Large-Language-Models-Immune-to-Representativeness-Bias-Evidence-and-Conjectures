{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25%** of the professors are in computer science.
* **75%** of the professors are in the humanities.

This means that before even considering the description, there's a higher prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

The description does offer some hints that could be seen as slightly more typical of someone in computer science (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles), but these are not exclusive to the field. Many people in the humanities enjoy logic puzzles and even dabble in coding.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description might align with some stereotypical views of computer science professors, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and should not be the primary basis for our judgment.
