**Reasoning:**

While there is no definitive information stating Jason's profession, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computational fields.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in both humanities and computer science professors.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for more technical fields, though not conclusively.

The key piece of information is the enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles.  While a humanities professor *could* enjoy these, it's significantly more likely in someone in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  It's entirely possible Jason is a humanities professor with unique hobbies.  The 0.75 reflects the likelihood given the provided description.
