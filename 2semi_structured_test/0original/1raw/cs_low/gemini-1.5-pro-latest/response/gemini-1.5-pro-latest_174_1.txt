**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, we can use the information to make an educated guess. Here's why I lean towards a higher probability:

* **Stereotype Alignment:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes of computer science professionals (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles). While stereotypes shouldn't be the sole basis, they often reflect some real-world trends in interests and career choices. 
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:** The description explicitly mentions Jason not enjoying drawing or writing, activities often associated with humanities fields.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The study is relatively small (100 people).
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality traits within a profession vary greatly. There are undoubtedly creative and artistic computer scientists and very logical and detail-oriented humanities professors. 

**Therefore, while not definitive, a probability of 0.75 (75%) seems reasonable given the available information.**
