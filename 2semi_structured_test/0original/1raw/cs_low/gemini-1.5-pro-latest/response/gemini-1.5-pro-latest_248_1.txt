**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's essential to focus on the base rates given in the study:

* **25% of the professors are in computer science.** 
* **75% of the professors are in the humanities.**

The description leans towards a computer science stereotype (enjoying coding, math puzzles), but it's not definitive.  Here's why relying too heavily on the description is problematic:

* **Small Sample Size:**  The personality quirks described might not be representative of all computer science professors.
* **Stereotype Bias:** Our own biases about what computer science professors are like might mislead us.

**The base rate of 75% for humanities professors is significantly higher than the 25% for computer science. Therefore, even with the description, it's more probable that Jason is among the larger group of humanities professors.**

**Important Note:** This is a probability, not a certainty.  There's still a chance Jason is a computer science professor, but based on the available information, it's less likely.
