{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, it leans towards computer science due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a core skill and passion for most computer scientists.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** Strong mathematical thinking is highly prevalent in computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators typically associated with humanities professors (e.g., love of literature, history, philosophy, etc.). 

**Important Notes:**

* **Not guaranteed:** Even with these indicators, it's not a certainty that Jason is in computer science.  Some humanities professors might enjoy coding or logic puzzles as hobbies.
* **Sample size:** The larger proportion of humanities professors (75 vs. 25) in the study influences the probability. If the sample sizes were equal, the probability would be higher.
