{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might be stereotypically associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the most important factor to consider is the sample size. 

* **75 out of the 100** professors in the study are from the humanities.
* Only **25 out of the 100** are from computer science. 

Therefore, it is significantly more likely that Jason, chosen randomly from this group, is a humanities professor.  While his individual traits might make him seem like a potential computer scientist, the base rates in the sample are much more important for determining probability.
