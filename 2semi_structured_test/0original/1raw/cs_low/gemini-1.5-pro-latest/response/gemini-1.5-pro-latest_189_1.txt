**Reasoning:**

While there is no definitive way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and having a talent described alongside ambition are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind often found in STEM fields. 
* **Lack of artistic inclination:** While not all computer scientists dislike art, the explicit mention that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, despite being creative, further pushes the probability away from humanities.

**It's crucial to note:** Personality profiles are not foolproof.  There are certainly creative and artistic individuals within computer science, and conversely, more analytical individuals within the humanities. However, given the information provided and the base rates in the study (25% computer science, 75% humanities), a probability leaning towards 0.75 is a reasonable estimate.
