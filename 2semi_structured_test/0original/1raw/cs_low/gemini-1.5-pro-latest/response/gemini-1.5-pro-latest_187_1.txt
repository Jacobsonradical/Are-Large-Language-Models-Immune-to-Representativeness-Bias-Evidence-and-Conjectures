**Reasoning:**

While this is not a perfectly scientific approach, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided:

* **Prior Probability:** The sample has 3 times more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25).  So, before considering the description, there's a 25% chance Jason is a computer science professor.

* **Description Influence:**  The description leans towards traits often associated with computer science:
    * "Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators. 
    * While "conservative and careful" might be considered stereotypical, they don't strongly point to one field or the other.

* **Subjective Adjustment:** The description significantly increases the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.  It's unlikely someone who enjoys coding and math puzzles would choose a career in the humanities.

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the description provides enough evidence to significantly shift the probability towards Jason being a computer science professor. A probability of 0.75 reflects this increased likelihood while acknowledging there's still a chance he could be in the humanities.
