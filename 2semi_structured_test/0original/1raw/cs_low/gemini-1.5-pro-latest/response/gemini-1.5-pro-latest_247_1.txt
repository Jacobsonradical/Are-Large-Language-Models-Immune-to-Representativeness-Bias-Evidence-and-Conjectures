**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based on the description, we can make an educated guess using Bayes' Theorem and some assumptions:

* **Prior Probability:** Our starting point is the study's composition: 25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors. So, the prior probability of Jason being in computer science is 0.25.

* **Likelihood:** The description leans towards a computer science stereotype:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles, activities strongly associated with computer science.
    * While creative, the dislike of drawing and writing might suggest a preference for more logic-based fields.

* **Assumption:**  We're assuming the provided description is somewhat informative and not entirely random.

Given the likelihood of the description aligning more with a computer science professor, we adjust the probability upwards from the initial 0.25. However, it's crucial to avoid extreme jumps.

**Therefore, a probability of 0.75 seems like a reasonable estimate.** It acknowledges the information provided while still recognizing the limitations of drawing definitive conclusions from a personality sketch.
