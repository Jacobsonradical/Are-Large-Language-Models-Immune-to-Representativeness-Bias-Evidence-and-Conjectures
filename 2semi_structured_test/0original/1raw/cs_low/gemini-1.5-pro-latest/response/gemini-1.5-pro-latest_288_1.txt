{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators favoring computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are much more aligned with the stereotype (and likely the reality) of computer science interests. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists may enjoy these, the description explicitly mentions high creativity, yet no interest in these artistic pursuits. This might suggest his creativity is channeled elsewhere, potentially coding.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes. It's entirely possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding or dislike drawing/writing. The sample size of the study is also quite small.
