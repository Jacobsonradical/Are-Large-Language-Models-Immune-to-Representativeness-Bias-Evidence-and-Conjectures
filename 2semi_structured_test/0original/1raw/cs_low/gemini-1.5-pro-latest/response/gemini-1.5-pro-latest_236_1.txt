{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are stronger indicators leaning towards computer science:

* **"Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles..."** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **"...Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing."**  This statement contrasts creativity with activities often associated with humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher prior probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
* **Limited Information:** The description, while suggestive, is not definitive.  Many personality traits and hobbies can be found across different professions.

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the description leans more towards Jason being a computer science professor. The probability of 0.75 reflects a balance between the base rate favoring humanities and the information in the description pointing towards computer science.
