{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues that might suggest a computer science background (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it lacks strong indicators for either field. 

Therefore, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
* 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

This means there's a **pre-existing 25% chance** of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science and a **75% chance** of them being in the humanities.  

Without stronger evidence from the personality description to shift those probabilities significantly, it's more likely that Jason falls into the larger group â€“ the humanities professors.
