**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypical Alignment:** The description aligns with common stereotypes of computer scientists: enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being analytical. 
* **Base Rate:** There's a higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample (25%) compared to humanities professors (75%).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes.  Personality descriptions are not always accurate predictors of profession.
