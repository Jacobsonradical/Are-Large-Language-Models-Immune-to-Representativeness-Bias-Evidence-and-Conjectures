**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are some key indicators that make it more likely Jason is a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest and likely aptitude for computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This skillset is highly relevant to computer science. 

The description does mention Jason is "highly creative," which might seem to point towards humanities. However, creativity is valuable in both fields.  The lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing is not a strong indicator either way. 

**Given that 25% of the sample were computer science professors and 75% were humanities professors, the information provided significantly increases the likelihood that Jason belongs to the smaller computer science group.** A simple Bayesian approach would suggest a probability significantly higher than the base rate of 0.25. While a precise calculation is difficult without more information, 0.75 represents a reasonable estimate.
