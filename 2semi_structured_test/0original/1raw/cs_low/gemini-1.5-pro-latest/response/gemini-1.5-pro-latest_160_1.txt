**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence about Jason's profession, it highlights traits and hobbies often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be applicable to both fields, but perhaps slightly more associated with the structured nature of computer science. 

Importantly, the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is higher (25%) than humanities professors (75%). Therefore, even without strong evidence, the prior probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. 

The description doesn't offer strong evidence against Jason being in computer science.  While he dislikes drawing and writing, these aren't necessarily disqualifying for a computer scientist.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor. Many humanities professors could fit this description as well.
