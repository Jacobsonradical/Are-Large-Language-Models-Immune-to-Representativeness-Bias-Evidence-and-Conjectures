{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:** Enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being highly creative while disliking drawing/writing strongly suggest analytical and logical inclinations favored in STEM fields. 
* **Lack of Humanities indicators:**  The description doesn't mention any interest in areas typically associated with the humanities, such as literature, history, philosophy, or art.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are artistic, and many humanities scholars enjoy logic puzzles. This response is based on probability given the specific information provided and the higher base rate of humanities professors in the study (75% vs. 25%).
