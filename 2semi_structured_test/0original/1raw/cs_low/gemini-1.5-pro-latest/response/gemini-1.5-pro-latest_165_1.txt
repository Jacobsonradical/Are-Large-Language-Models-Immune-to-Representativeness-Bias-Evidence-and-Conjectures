{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete evidence to definitively say whether Jason is a computer science professor, we can use the information provided to make a probabilistic judgment.

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) for a randomly chosen professor to be from humanities.

* **Stereotype Matching:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes associated with computer science: 
    * Enjoys coding
    * Solving mathematical puzzles
    * Not enjoying drawing or writing (potentially implying a preference for logic over arts)

While these stereotypes don't always hold true, they provide some evidence to shift the probability *slightly* in favor of Jason being a computer science professor.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is just a probabilistic estimate based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a significant chance Jason could be a humanities professor with interests in logic and problem-solving.
