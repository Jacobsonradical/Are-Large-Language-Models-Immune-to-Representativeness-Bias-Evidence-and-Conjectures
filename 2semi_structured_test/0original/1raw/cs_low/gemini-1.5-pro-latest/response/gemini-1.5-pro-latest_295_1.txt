**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know Jason's profession from the description, we can make an educated guess based on probability and the information provided:

* **Prior Probability:**  The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a base 25% chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.

* **Description Clues:** The description highlights Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities strongly associated with computer science. While humanities professors can be analytical, these specific hobbies suggest a higher likelihood of being in a computational field.

* **Ambiguity:**  The description does mention Jason being creative but disliking drawing and writing. This could point either way: he might find creative outlets within computer science, or it could suggest a less likely fit for traditionally creative humanities disciplines.

**Conclusion:**

The strong clues related to coding and mathematical puzzles outweigh the more ambiguous information. It's more likely that someone with these interests is among the computer science professors. Since the base probability of being a computer science professor in the sample is 25%, the description significantly increases that likelihood.  A probability of **0.75 (or 75%)** seems like a reasonable estimate, acknowledging there's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
