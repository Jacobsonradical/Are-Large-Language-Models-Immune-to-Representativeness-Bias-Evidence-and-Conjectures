{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with both computer science and humanities professors, there are some strong indicators leaning towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly typical of individuals in computer science fields.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, a lack of interest in these areas might be less common. 

Given these indicators, and the fact that the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors (a 1:3 ratio), a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) reflects that it's more likely Jason belongs to the smaller computer science group.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There is no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, as the description lacks definitive proof.
