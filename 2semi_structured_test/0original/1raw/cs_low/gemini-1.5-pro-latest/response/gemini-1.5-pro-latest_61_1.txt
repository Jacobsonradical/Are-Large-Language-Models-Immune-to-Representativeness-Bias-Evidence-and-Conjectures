{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues point towards Jason being more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and logical thinking common in computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again aligning with computer science.

The description doesn't offer strong evidence against Jason being in the humanities, but the positive indicators for computer science are more compelling.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles and many computer scientists are artistic. This response is based on probabilistic reasoning given the limited information.
