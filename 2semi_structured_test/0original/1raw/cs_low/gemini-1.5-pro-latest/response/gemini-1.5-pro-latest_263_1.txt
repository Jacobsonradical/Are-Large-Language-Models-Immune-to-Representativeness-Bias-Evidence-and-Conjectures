{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to base the probability on the sample sizes provided. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** There are 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study. This means there's a higher baseline probability that any randomly chosen professor, even with Jason's description, is from the humanities.
* **Weak Stereotypes:** While the description aligns with some stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoying coding, math puzzles), these are not exclusive to the field.  Many humanities professors might also enjoy these activities. 
* **Lack of Strong Indicators:** The description lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards computer science. For example, mentioning specific research interests or publications in computer science would have been much stronger clues.

**Therefore, while Jason's description might slightly increase the probability of him being a computer science professor, the large difference in sample size means it's still more likely he's from the humanities group.** 

It's important to note that this is still a probability, not a certainty.  There's a chance Jason is a computer science professor who defies typical stereotypes.
