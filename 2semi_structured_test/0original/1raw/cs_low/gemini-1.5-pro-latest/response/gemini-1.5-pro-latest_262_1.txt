**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the fact that Jason enjoys "coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are stronger indicators of a computer science background. 

Here's why:

* **Coding:**  Coding is a fundamental skill in computer science. While some humanities professors might have basic coding knowledge, it's less likely to be something they actively enjoy.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for mathematical puzzles aligns more strongly with the logical and analytical thinking often associated with computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles. The higher probability assigned to Jason being a computer science professor simply reflects the stronger association of these traits with that field.
