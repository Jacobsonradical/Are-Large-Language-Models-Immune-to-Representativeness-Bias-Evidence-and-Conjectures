**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25%** of the professors are in computer science.
* **75%** of the professors are in the humanities.

The description leans towards a computer science stereotype (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles), but these traits are not exclusive to computer science.  Many individuals in the humanities could also enjoy these activities.

Without strong evidence pointing towards Jason being in computer science, the **base rate of 75% for humanities professors** heavily influences the probability. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors, but the information provided doesn't eliminate the possibility of him being a computer science professor.  A probability of 0.75 reflects this.
