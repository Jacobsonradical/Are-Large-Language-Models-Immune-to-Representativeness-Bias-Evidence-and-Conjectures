{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the emphasis on specific traits increases the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor. These traits include:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This aligns strongly with skills and interests common in computer science. 

The description does mention Jason being "highly creative," which might seem to point towards humanities. However, creativity is important in many fields, including computer science. 

The lack of interest in drawing or writing is not a strong indicator either way. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor. The sample size is also relatively small, which impacts the reliability of making strong assumptions.
