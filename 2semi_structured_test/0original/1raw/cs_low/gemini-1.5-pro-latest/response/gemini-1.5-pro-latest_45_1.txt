{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative, careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science.

It's important to remember:

* **Stereotypes are not definitive:**  Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles or have similar personality traits. 
* **The sample size matters:** There are three times as many humanities professors in the study.

Given the information, a probability leaning towards Jason being a computer science professor (like 0.75) seems reasonable, but it's not a certainty.
