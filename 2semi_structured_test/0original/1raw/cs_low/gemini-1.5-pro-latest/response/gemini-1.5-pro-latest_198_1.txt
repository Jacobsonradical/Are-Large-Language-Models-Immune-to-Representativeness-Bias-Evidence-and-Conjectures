**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively state Jason's profession, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, could be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of the field.

The description does mention Jason being highly creative but disliking drawing or writing. This might seem counterintuitive for a humanities professor. However, creativity manifests in various ways, and technical creativity is essential in computer science. 

**Important Note:** This probability is based on limited information and relies on stereotypes.  Many humanities professors might enjoy coding, and many computer science professors might be talented writers or artists.
