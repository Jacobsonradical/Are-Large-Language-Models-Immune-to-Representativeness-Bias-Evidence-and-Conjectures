**Reasoning:**

While not a foolproof indicator, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** Directly aligns with core computer science activities.
* **Conservative and careful:** Might suggest a preference for the structured, logic-based world of coding.
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:**  While some in the humanities may not enjoy these either, it further distances Jason from stereotypical humanities interests.

The description doesn't offer strong evidence AGAINST Jason being in the humanities. However, the presence of multiple computer science-related traits makes it more likely he belongs to that group.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. There are plenty of humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or dislike drawing, and many computer scientists who are highly creative in artistic ways.
