{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be stereotypically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles), the key piece of information is the sample composition. 

* There were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
* Conversely, there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability they are from the humanities.

Since we have no other information about Jason besides this generic description, the **prior probability** based on the sample composition should heavily influence our estimate.  It's more likely he's in the larger group (humanities).
