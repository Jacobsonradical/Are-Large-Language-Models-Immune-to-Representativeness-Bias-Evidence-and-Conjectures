{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know without access to the full dataset and analysis from the study, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided. 

* **Prior Probability:** The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a base 25% chance of any randomly chosen professor being in computer science.

* **Description Clues:** The description highlights Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These are activities more stereotypically associated with computer science than humanities.

* **Ambiguity:** The description also mentions Jason being highly creative but disliking drawing and writing.  This doesn't strongly point towards either field, as creativity can manifest in numerous ways.

**Conclusion:**  While the description isn't definitive, the mention of coding and mathematical puzzles significantly increases the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor. It's likely higher than the base 25% chance, and 75% seems like a reasonable estimate.
