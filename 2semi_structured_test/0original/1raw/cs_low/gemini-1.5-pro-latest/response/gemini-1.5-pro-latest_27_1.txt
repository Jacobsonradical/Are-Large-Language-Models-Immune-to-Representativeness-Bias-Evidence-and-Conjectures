**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, the most significant factor influencing the probability is the study's composition. There are three times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the sample. 

Therefore, without any information about Jason, the baseline probability of him being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description does contain elements that might be considered stereotypically aligned with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles). However, these are not exclusive to computer science and could also be hobbies enjoyed by individuals in the humanities. 

While the description might slightly increase the probability of Jason being a computer science professor, the heavy skew towards humanities professors in the sample means it's still more likely he belongs to that group.  

Given the lack of strong, exclusive indicators for computer science, a probability around 0.75 (representing a significant chance of being in the larger group) seems appropriate.
