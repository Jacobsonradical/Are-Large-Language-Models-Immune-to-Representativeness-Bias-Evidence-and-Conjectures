{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain without more information, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes about computer scientists (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles). While stereotypes are not always accurate, they often influence our perceptions.
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:** The description explicitly states Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are often associated with humanities fields.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The study only includes 25 computer science professors. This limited sample size might not accurately represent the personality diversity within the field.
* **Individual Variation:**  People within the same profession can have vastly different personalities. Not all computer scientists fit the stereotype presented. 

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the available information suggests a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor. The 0.75 probability reflects this leaning while acknowledging the possibility that he might be in the humanities.
