{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no information in the description explicitly stating Jason's profession, we can use the available information to make an educated guess based on probability. 

* **Prior Probability:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, giving us a base probability of 25/100 = 0.25 that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science. 
* **Description:** The description highlights traits that might be seen as stereotypically aligning with computer science:
    * Enjoys coding
    * Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles
    * Logical (implied by enjoying the above)

These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, increase the likelihood that Jason belongs to the computer science group.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is a probability, not a certainty.  We are making an educated guess based on limited information and stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with a passion for logic puzzles and coding as hobbies.
