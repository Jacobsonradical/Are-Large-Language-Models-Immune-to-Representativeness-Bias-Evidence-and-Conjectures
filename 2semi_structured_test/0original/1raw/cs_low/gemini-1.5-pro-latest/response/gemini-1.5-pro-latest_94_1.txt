{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on stereotypes, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often found in computer science fields.
* **Conservative and Careful:**  These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests creativity expressed through problem-solving and potentially coding, rather than artistic pursuits. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  The humanities also require creativity, analytical thinking, and can attract those who enjoy logic puzzles. The 0.75 probability reflects a leaning based on the provided information, but acknowledges there's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with these interests.
