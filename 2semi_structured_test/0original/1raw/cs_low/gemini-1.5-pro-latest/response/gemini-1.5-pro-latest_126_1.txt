{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have definitive proof, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these points:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits might be more common in fields requiring precision and logical thinking.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests his creativity might be channeled into less artistic and more technical avenues.

**Important Note:**  The probability is not 1 (or 100%) because:

* **Sample Size:** 75 out of 100 professors are from humanities, meaning there's still a significant chance Jason belongs to that group.
* **Stereotypes:**  We're relying on some stereotypical associations between personality traits and professions. It's crucial to remember that these are not absolute and many humanities professors could also enjoy the activities mentioned.
