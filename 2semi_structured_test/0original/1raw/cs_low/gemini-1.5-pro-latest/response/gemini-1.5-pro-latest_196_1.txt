**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an aptitude and interest aligned with computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be connected to the detail-oriented and logical nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, further supporting the likelihood of being in computer science.

**Important Note:**  Personality profiling for career prediction is highly unreliable. This response is based on stereotypes and probabilities within the limited context provided by the study.  It's crucial to avoid making assumptions about individuals based on such descriptions in real-world scenarios.
