**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from the humanities, while only 25 are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from humanities and a 25% chance they are from computer science.
* **Description:** The description leans towards stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, math puzzles). However, these stereotypes are not absolute, and many humanities professors could also enjoy these activities.
* **Insufficient Information:** The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly outweigh the base rate. 

**Conclusion:**

While the description hints at Jason potentially being a computer science professor, the strong base rate of humanities professors (75%) makes it more likely that he belongs to that group. A probability of 0.75 reflects this balance between the prior information and the description.
