{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, some clues point towards a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests creativity channeled towards technical pursuits rather than artistic ones, aligning more with computer science.

It's important to note:

* **The information is not definitive:**  Personality traits are not exclusive to any profession. There are creative and detail-oriented individuals in both computer science and the humanities.
* **Base rate matters:** There were three times as many humanities professors in the study. This prior probability significantly influences the final assessment.

**Calculating the Probability:**

It's difficult to assign a precise numerical probability. However, considering the clues and the base rate, a probability of **0.75** seems reasonable. This indicates that it's more likely Jason is a computer science professor, but it's not a certainty.
