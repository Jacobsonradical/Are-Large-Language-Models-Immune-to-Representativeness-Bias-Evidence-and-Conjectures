{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the following points strongly suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This aligns well with the logical and problem-solving skills often found in computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities, making the computer science probability significantly higher.
