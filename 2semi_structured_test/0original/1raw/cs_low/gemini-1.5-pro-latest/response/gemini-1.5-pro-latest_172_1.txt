{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **Base Rate:** There is a higher base rate of humanities professors (75%) than computer science professors (25%) in the study. 
* **Description:**  The description leans towards stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, math puzzles). However, these are not exclusive to computer science and could apply to some within the humanities.

**Therefore, while the description might slightly increase the probability of Jason being a computer science professor, the higher base rate of humanities professors still makes it more likely he belongs to that group.**

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer. It's impossible to say for certain without more information.
