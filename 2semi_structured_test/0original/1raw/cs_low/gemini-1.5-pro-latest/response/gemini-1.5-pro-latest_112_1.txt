**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, the most important factor is the prior probability.  Here's why:

* **Prior Probability:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities and 25 are in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is from humanities and a 25% chance they are from computer science.
* **Description Clues:** The description hints that Jason might fit the stereotype of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, math puzzles). However, these traits are not exclusive to computer science, and many humanities professors could also enjoy these activities.

**Without strong evidence to shift the probability significantly from the prior, it's more likely Jason belongs to the larger group (humanities). However, the description does make him slightly more likely to be a computer science professor.** 

Therefore, a probability of 0.75 (representing a 75% chance Jason is in humanities) is a reasonable estimate.
