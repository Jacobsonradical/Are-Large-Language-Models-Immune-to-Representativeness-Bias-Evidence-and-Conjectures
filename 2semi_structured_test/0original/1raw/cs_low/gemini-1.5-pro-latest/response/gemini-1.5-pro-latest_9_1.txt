{"probability": "0.75"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, we need to focus on the base rates (prior probabilities) to make an accurate assessment.

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which represents a base probability of 0.25. The remaining 75 are in the humanities (a base probability of 0.75).
* **Description:** The description leans towards a computer science profile (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles), but it's not definitive.  Many humanities professors might also enjoy these activities.
* **Insufficient Evidence:** The description doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly outweigh the initial base rate difference. 

**Conclusion:**

It's more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors simply because there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample. A probability of 0.75 acknowledges the higher base rate while still considering the slight lean towards a computer science profile in the description.
