{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the following points tilt the probability in favor of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This aligns well with the analytical and problem-solving skills often found in computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators that would point definitively to humanities. While Jason's enjoyment of jogging and his family life are neutral factors, his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles are more closely associated with computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There is still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with interests in computational linguistics, digital humanities, or simply enjoys coding as a hobby.
