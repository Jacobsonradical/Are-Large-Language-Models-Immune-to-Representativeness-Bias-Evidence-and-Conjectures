{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no information explicitly stating Jason's profession, we can use the provided details to make an educated guess based on probabilities:

* **Prior Probability:**  There's a higher baseline probability that Jason is in the humanities. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities (75%) and 25 are in computer science (25%).

* **Relevant Information:** The description highlights traits and hobbies more commonly associated with computer science:
    * "Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with the computer science field.
    *  While "highly creative" might seem fitting for humanities, his dislike for "drawing or writing" suggests a preference for more technical creativity. 

* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:** The description lacks strong indicators that would clearly point towards humanities (e.g., love of literature, history, languages).

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the available information skews the probability towards Jason being a computer science professor.  The 0.75 probability reflects this, taking into account the higher initial probability of him being in humanities but adjusting it based on the description.
