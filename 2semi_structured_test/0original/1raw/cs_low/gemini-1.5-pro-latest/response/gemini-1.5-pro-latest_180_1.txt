{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based on the description, we can make an educated guess using probabilities and stereotypes (acknowledging that stereotypes are not always accurate):

* **Prior Probability:** The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities. 
* **Stereotype Matching:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes about computer science: enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles, and a preference for logic-based activities over arts like drawing and writing.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to recognize that this is a highly simplified assessment.  Personality traits are not exclusive to any profession, and many computer scientists enjoy artistic pursuits.  The provided description doesn't give us enough information for a definitive answer.
