{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the description. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes and Base Rates:** It's tempting to focus on Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align with common stereotypes of computer scientists. However, it's crucial to consider the base rate: 
    * 25% of the professors in the study are in computer science.
    * 75% are in the humanities. 
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:**  The description doesn't offer strong indicators that Jason works in a specific humanities field. While his dislike of drawing and writing might suggest he's not in visual or literary arts, these activities don't represent the breadth of humanities disciplines.

**Therefore, even though Jason fits some computer science stereotypes, the higher base rate for humanities professors makes it more likely he belongs to that group.** 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. Stereotypes are not always accurate, and many computer scientists may not fit the description, just as many humanities professors might.
