**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might align with stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the sample size is the most important factor here. 

* **75% of the professors in the study are from the humanities.** 
* **Only 25% are from computer science.**

Without strong evidence to the contrary, the baseline probability should follow the sample distribution. Therefore, there is a higher probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
