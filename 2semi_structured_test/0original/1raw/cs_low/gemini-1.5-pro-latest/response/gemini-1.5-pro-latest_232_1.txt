{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might seem stereotypical of computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the most important factor to consider is the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study.

* There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
* Conversely, there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability they are in the humanities.

**The description, while somewhat suggestive, doesn't provide strong enough evidence to significantly shift the probability from the baseline of 0.25.**  Many humanities professors could also fit Jason's description.
