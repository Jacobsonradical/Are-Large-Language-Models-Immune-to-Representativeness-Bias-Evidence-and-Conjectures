**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that might seem stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving puzzles), the key factor to consider is the sample composition. 

* **75 out of 100** professors in the study are from the humanities. 
* Only **25 out of 100** are from computer science. 

This means there's a **75% chance** that any randomly selected professor from this study is from the humanities field, making it the more likely scenario for Jason, even without strong stereotypical indicators.
