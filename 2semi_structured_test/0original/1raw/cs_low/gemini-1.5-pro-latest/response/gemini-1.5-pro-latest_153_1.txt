**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues that might point towards Jason being a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's crucial to consider the sample composition. 

* There are 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25) in the study. 
* This means that even if we assume the personality description is slightly more common among computer science professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from humanities is significantly higher.

Therefore, while not certain, it's more probable that Jason, with his described traits, is one of the humanities professors in the sample. The given probability of 0.75 reflects this higher likelihood based on the sample distribution.
