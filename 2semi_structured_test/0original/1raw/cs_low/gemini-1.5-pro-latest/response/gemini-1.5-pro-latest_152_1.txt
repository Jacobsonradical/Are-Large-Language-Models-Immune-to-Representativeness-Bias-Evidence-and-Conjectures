**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no direct evidence about Jason's profession, it highlights traits and hobbies often associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to the field, these traits might align with the detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while creative pursuits, might be seen as slightly more indicative of a computer science inclination than a humanities one.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes.  There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor. Many humanities professors might share these traits and hobbies. The higher probability simply reflects that the description leans slightly more towards a stereotypical computer science profile.
