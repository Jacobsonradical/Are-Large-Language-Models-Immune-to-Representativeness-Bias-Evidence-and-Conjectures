{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know Jason's profession based on this description, we can make an educated guess based on probability and the information given:

* **Prior Probability:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which means there's a base 25% chance (or 0.25 probability) that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
* **Description Influence:** The description highlights traits and hobbies that align more with stereotypes of computer science professors:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles.
    * Logical and analytical thinking (implied by "careful").
* **Less Alignment with Humanities:** While some aspects (like being "highly creative") could fit humanities, the description emphasizes technical interests over things like writing or drawing.

**Therefore, while not guaranteed, it's more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors.  A probability of 0.75 (or 75%) reflects this higher likelihood, taking into account both the base rate and the description's suggestive information.**
