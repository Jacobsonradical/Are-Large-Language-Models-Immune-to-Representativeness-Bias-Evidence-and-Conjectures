{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are strong indicators pointing towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator for a computer science professor.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This aligns strongly with the skills and interests of someone in a computer science field.

The description lacks strong indicators for a humanities professor.  While Jason is described as "highly creative," his dislike for drawing and writing makes a humanities focus less likely.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual hobbies. However, based on the available data, a higher probability leans towards him being a computer science professor.
