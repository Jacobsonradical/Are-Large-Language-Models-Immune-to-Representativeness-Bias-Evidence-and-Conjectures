{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a strong indicator, directly related to the field.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Also points towards a logical and analytical mindset often found in computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators we might associate with humanities professors (love of literature, history, writing, etc.).

**Important Note:** Stereotypes don't always hold true. This assessment is based on probabilities within the context of the study and the provided description. There's certainly a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
