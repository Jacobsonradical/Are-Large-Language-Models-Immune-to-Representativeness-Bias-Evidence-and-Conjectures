**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, traits common in computer science. 
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:** While not definitive, the lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for technical fields over humanities.
* **Baseline Probability:**  It's important to remember that the sample itself has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). However, the personality description provides enough evidence to shift the probability significantly towards Jason being a computer science professor.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. Personality sketches are not reliable indicators of profession, and many computer science professors enjoy artistic pursuits, while many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles.
