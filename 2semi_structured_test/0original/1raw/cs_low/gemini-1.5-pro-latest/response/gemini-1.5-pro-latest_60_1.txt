**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits might align with the precision and detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for technical over artistic expression, further supporting the likelihood of Jason being in computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes.  Personality alone is not a definitive predictor of someone's profession.
