**Reasoning:**

While there is no information directly stating Jason's profession, we can use the provided information to make an informed guess.  

* **Sample Sizes:** The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline chance (75%) of any randomly selected professor being from the humanities. 
* **Stereotypical Fit:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes about computer science: enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being less interested in drawing or writing (though this is a generalization and not always accurate).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is based on limited information and potentially biased stereotypes. There's a good chance Jason could be a humanities professor who enjoys logic puzzles and coding as hobbies. The provided probability is simply an educated guess based on the available data.
