**Reasoning:**

While there is no information explicitly stating Jason's profession, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a strong indicator of potential involvement in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** Computer science often involves strong mathematical and logical thinking.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits can be associated with the detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while not eliminating the possibility of being in the humanities, further suggests a stronger inclination towards a more technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes.  There is a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unique interests. However, based on the available information, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
