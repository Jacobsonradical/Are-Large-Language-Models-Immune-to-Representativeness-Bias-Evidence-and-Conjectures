**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor for these reasons:

* **Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are highly aligned with computer science. Jogging is a neutral activity.  
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:** The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" suggests his creativity might be channeled in a more analytical field like computer science.
* **Base Rate:** There's a higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample (25%) compared to humanities professors (75%). 

It's crucial to remember this is just a probability based on limited information.  Other factors could influence Jason's actual profession.
