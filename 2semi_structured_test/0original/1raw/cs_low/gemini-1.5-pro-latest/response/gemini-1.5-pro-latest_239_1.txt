**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might seem stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's crucial to rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **75 out of 100** professors in the sample are from the humanities.
* **25 out of 100** professors in the sample are from computer science. 

This means there's a **3 times higher probability** that a randomly selected professor from this study is from the humanities compared to computer science. Therefore, even without strong evidence pointing towards one field or the other, the base rate heavily favors Jason being a humanities professor. 

It's important to avoid letting personal biases about personality traits and professions override the statistical information provided.
