**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's essential to focus on the base rates provided in the study description:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25% of the total sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75% of the total sample.

The description leans towards traits often associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles), but it doesn't definitively exclude someone in the humanities.  

**Without further information, the prior probability (base rate) is the best estimate.**  Since 75% of the professors in the study are from the humanities, there's a higher chance Jason belongs to that group. 

**Important Note:**  This is a probability based on limited information. A more accurate assessment would require analyzing the descriptions of all 100 professors and looking for patterns that differentiate the two groups.
