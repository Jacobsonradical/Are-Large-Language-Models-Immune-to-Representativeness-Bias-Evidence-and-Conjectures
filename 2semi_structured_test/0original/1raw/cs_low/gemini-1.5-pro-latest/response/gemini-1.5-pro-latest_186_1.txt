**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, the most important piece of information is the composition of the study sample:

* **25%** of the professors are in computer science.
* **75%** of the professors are in the humanities.

**Without any personality information, the base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25% (or 0.25).**

The description does offer some hints that might increase the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are more stereotypically associated with computer science.

However, these are just weak indicators and don't definitively place Jason in either field.  The large disparity in the sample size (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science professors) is much more significant.

Therefore, while the probability is likely somewhat higher than the base rate of 0.25 due to the personality hints, it's still more probable that Jason falls within the larger group of humanities professors. A probability of **0.75** for Jason being a humanities professor (and consequently 0.25 for computer science) reflects a more balanced weighting of the information provided.
