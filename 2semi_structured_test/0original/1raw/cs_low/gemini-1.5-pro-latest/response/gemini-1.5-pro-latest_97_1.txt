{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests aligned with computer science:** Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Lack of interest in drawing/writing:**  While not definitive, the lack of interest in these areas might suggest a preference for the more technical field of computer science.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to avoid stereotyping. Many humanities professors might enjoy coding or be skilled at math, just as some computer science professors might love drawing or writing.
* **Small Sample Size:** The study only included 25 computer science professors. This relatively small sample size means we shouldn't draw overly strong conclusions.

**The 0.75 probability reflects a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor based on the given information, but it's by no means a certainty.**
