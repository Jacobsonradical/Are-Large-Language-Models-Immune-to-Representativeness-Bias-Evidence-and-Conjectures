**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information about Jason's personality and hobbies, the key to determining the probability lies in the study's composition:

* **25 computer science professors:** This represents 25% of the study sample.
* **75 humanities professors:** This represents 75% of the study sample.

The description aligns more stereotypically with a computer science professor (enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles).  However, this is just a stereotype, and there's no concrete evidence to suggest Jason isn't a humanities professor with atypical hobbies. 

**Since we have no further information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study, which is 0.75 or 75%.**
