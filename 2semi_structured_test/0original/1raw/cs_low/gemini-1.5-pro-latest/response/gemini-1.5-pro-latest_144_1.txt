**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be considered stereotypical of both computer science professors and humanities professors, the emphasis on specific traits heavily points towards a computer science background:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a strong indicator for a computer science profession.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This aligns well with the logical and problem-solving nature of computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators for a humanities background, making it more likely that Jason belongs to the computer science group.

While the base rate of humanities professors (75) is higher than computer science professors (25), the provided description significantly outweighs the base rate in favor of Jason being a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer, and not a definitive one. The provided information does not guarantee Jason's profession, but suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor.
