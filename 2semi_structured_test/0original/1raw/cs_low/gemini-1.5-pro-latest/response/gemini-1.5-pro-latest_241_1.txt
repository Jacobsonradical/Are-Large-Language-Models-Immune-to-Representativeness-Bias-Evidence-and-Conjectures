**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know Jason's profession based on the description, we can use the information to make an educated guess. Here's why:

* **Base Rates:** The study included 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of the description belonging to a humanities professor.
* **Stereotypes:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about computer science: enjoying coding, math puzzles, and having a less artistic inclination. However, these stereotypes are not always accurate. 

**Considering Both:** While the description leans towards a computer science stereotype, the significantly higher base rate of humanities professors is more important. Therefore, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) for Jason being a humanities professor is a more statistically sound guess.
