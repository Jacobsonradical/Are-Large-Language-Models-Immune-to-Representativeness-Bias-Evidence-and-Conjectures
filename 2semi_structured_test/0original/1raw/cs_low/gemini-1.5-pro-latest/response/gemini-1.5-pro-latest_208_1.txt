{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Explanation:**

While we don't have concrete data on the personality traits of all computer science vs. humanities professors, the description leans towards stereotypes often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators often linked to computer science interests.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be perceived as more common in structured fields like computer science. 

It's important to remember these are just stereotypes. There are plenty of creative and less "conservative" individuals in computer science, and many humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.  

However, based purely on the provided description and common stereotypes, there's a higher likelihood that Jason fits the profile of the computer science group, hence a probability of 0.75.
