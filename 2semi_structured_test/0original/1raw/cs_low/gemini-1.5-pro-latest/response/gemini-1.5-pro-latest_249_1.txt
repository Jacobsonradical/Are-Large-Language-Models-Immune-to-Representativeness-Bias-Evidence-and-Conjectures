{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, it leans towards computer science for these reasons:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of interests aligned with computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with structured fields like computer science.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:** This suggests a preference for technical over artistic expression, again pointing towards computer science.

It's important to note that this is just a probability based on limited information.  There are creative computer scientists and humanities professors who enjoy coding. However, based on the provided profile and the base rates (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors), a probability of 0.75 seems reasonable.
