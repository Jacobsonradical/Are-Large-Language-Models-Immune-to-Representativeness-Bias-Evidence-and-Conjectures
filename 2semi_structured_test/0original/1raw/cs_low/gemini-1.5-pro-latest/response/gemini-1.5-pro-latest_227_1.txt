**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of someone likely to be in a computer science field.
* **Creative but not artistic:** The description explicitly mentions Jason being creative but disliking drawing and writing. This further supports a technical/analytical inclination over a more traditional humanities focus.

**Important Note:** Personality alone is not a reliable predictor of profession.  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.
