**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset common in computer science. 
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:**  While not all humanities professors are artistically inclined, this further suggests a preference for technical pursuits.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer. There's nothing explicitly stating Jason *must* be in computer science.  A humanities professor could easily have these interests. However, given the information, it's more likely he's part of the larger (75%) computer science group in the study.
