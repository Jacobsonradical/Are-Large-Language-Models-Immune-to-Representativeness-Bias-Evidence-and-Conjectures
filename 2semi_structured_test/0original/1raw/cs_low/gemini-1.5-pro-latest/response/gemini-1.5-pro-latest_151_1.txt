**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure based solely on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:** Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Lack of humanities indicators:**  He dislikes drawing and writing, activities often linked to humanities fields. 
* **Baseline Probability:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly selected professor is from the humanities.

However, the description does not definitively rule out Jason being a humanities professor. It's possible to be in the humanities and enjoy logic puzzles or coding as hobbies. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) acknowledges the strong STEM leanings in the description while recognizing that it's not a certainty.
