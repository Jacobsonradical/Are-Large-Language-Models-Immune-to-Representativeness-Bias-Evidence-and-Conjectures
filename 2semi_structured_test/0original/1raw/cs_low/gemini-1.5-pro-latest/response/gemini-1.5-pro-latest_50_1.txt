**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to rely on the base rates provided in the study setup. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from the humanities, while only 25 are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from the humanities, regardless of their personality. 
* **Personality Clues:**  While Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles suggests he *could* be in computer science, these traits aren't exclusive to that field.  Humanities disciplines often involve logic, problem-solving, and even computational methods in some areas. 

**Conclusion:**

Without more definitive information linking Jason's personality specifically to computer science, the higher base rate for humanities professors makes it statistically more likely he belongs to that group.  The provided probability of 0.75 reflects this.
