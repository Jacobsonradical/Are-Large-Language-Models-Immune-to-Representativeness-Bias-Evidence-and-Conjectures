**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are key indicators that increase the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator for computer science. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This aligns strongly with the problem-solving nature of computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities. While Jason is described as "highly creative," his disinterest in drawing and writing might suggest his creativity manifests in other ways, such as problem-solving or technical innovation. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, the available evidence points towards a higher probability of him being in computer science.
