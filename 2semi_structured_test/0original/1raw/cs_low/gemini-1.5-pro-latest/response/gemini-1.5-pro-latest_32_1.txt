**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information that might seem stereotypical of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the key is the sample size. 

* **75% of the study participants were humanities professors.** 
* **Only 25% were computer science professors.**

This means it's statistically more likely that Jason, even with those interests, falls into the larger group of humanities professors. 

**Important Note:**  Stereotypes are not reliable indicators. This answer is based purely on the probability given the sample sizes in the study.
