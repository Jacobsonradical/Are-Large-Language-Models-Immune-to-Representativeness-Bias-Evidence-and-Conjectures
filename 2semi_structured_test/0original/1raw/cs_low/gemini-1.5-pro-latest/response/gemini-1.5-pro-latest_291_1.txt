**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know Jason's profession from the description, we can use the available information to make an educated guess based on probability:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which is a base probability of 0.25.
* **Stereotype Match:** The description aligns with common stereotypes of computer science professionals (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles). 

However, it's important to acknowledge:

* **Stereotypes are not always accurate:**  Many people who enjoy those activities are not in computer science.
* **Humanities professors can also be analytical:**  Enjoying puzzles and logic isn't exclusive to one field.

Therefore, while the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor, it's not a certainty.  A probability of 0.75 reflects a higher likelihood based on the information, but acknowledges the possibility that he could be in the humanities.
