{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it offers some clues that can be interpreted using Bayesian reasoning:

* **Base Rate:** The sample contains 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher prior probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

* **Personality Hints:** The description highlights traits often associated with computer science:
    * **"Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles..."** These are strong indicators aligning with computer science interests. 

While it's certainly possible for humanities professors to possess these traits, the combination strengthens the likelihood that Jason belongs to the computer science group.

* **Lack of Contrary Evidence:**  The description does not offer any strong indicators towards humanities. While not disliking drawing/writing doesn't definitively point to computer science, it doesn't contradict it either.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the base rate and the personality hints provided, it's more probable that Jason is one of the computer science professors.  The exact probability is subjective, but a value around 0.75 seems reasonable.
