{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession from a brief personality sketch, we can make an educated guess based on probability and the information given.

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors.  This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of any randomly chosen professor being in the humanities.

* **Stereotype Matching:** Some of the descriptors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more with common stereotypes of computer science professors. 

However, it's crucial to avoid overemphasizing stereotypes. Many humanities professors are also skilled in logic and might enjoy puzzles. Additionally, creativity is valuable in both fields.

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the information slightly leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. The stereotype matching slightly outweighs the base rate. A probability of 0.75 represents a reasonable estimate given the available information.
