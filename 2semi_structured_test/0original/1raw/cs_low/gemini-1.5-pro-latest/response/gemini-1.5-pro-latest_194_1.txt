**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, the most important piece of information is the composition of the study's sample:

* 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science (25%)
* 75 out of 100 professors are from humanities (75%)

The description aligns with stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles), making it more likely Jason belongs to that group. However, it's crucial to avoid the **base rate fallacy**.  We can't ignore the fact that humanities professors are *three times* more common in the sample. 

Without further information, the prior probability (75% chance of being a humanities professor) should heavily influence our estimate.  

**Important Note:** My answer is a subjective probability based on limited information.  A more sophisticated Bayesian approach could incorporate the strength of the stereotype, but even then, the high base rate of humanities professors would be a significant factor.
