**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup:

* **25** computer science professors
* **75** humanities professors

This means there's a **3:1** prior probability that any randomly selected professor from this group is in the humanities.  

The description leans towards a computer science stereotype (enjoys coding, math puzzles), but it's not definitive.  A humanities professor could also be conservative, ambitious, and enjoy those activities.  

Therefore, while the probability is likely higher than the base rate of 0.25 (25/100), it's not overwhelmingly conclusive. A probability of **0.75** reflects a significant, but not absolute, lean towards Jason being a computer science professor.
