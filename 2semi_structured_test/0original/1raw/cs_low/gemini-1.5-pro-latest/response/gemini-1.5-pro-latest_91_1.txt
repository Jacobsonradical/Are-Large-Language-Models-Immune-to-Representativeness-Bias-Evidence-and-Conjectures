{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a brief personality sketch, the description leans towards characteristics often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing and writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

It's important to remember this is a probabilistic judgment.  The information about Jason is suggestive, not definitive.  The higher base rate of humanities professors (75% vs 25%) is a counterbalancing factor.  However, the description aligns more strongly with a computer science profile.
