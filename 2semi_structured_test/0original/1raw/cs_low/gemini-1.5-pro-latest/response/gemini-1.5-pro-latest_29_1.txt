{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are stronger indicators of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator for computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** Also leans heavily towards computer science. 

The other details are less informative:

* **Conservative, careful, talented, ambitious:** These traits can be found in both fields.
* **Enjoys jogging:** Not particularly indicative of either field.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  While this might suggest someone less likely to be in the humanities, it's not a strong enough indicator on its own. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with a passion for coding and mathematics.  We're making an educated guess based on the provided data.
