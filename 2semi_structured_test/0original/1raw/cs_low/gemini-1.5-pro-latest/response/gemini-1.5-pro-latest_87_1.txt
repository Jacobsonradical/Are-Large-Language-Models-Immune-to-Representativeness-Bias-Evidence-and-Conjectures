{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be consistent with either field, there are stronger indicators that Jason might be a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less common in that field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This significantly influences the probability.
* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypes. While the description aligns with some common perceptions of computer scientists, it's not definitive.

**Conclusion:**

Given the information, a probability of 0.75 (75%) seems reasonable. However, it's essential to remember this is based on limited information and probabilistic reasoning. There's still a 25% chance Jason could be a humanities professor.
