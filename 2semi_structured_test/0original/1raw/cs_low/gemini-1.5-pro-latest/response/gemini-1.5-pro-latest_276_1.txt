**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that might be stereotypically associated with computer science professors (enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles), the most important clue is the sample size. 

* There were 25 computer science professors in the study.
* There were 75 humanities professors in the study.

This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability a randomly chosen professor is in computer science and a 75/100 = 0.75 probability they are in the humanities.  Since the description doesn't offer overwhelmingly strong evidence to shift away from the base probabilities, the chance of Jason being a computer science professor remains relatively low.
