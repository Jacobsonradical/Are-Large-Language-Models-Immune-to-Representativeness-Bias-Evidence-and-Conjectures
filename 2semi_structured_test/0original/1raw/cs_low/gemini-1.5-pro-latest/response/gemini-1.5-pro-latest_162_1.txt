{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based on the description, we can use the information provided to make an educated guess. The description highlights traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits aren't exclusive to any profession, they are often associated with detail-oriented fields like computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators of a humanities background. The fact that he dislikes drawing and writing, while creative, might weakly point away from certain humanities fields.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  It's entirely possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding or for computer science professors to be artistic.  The higher probability assigned to computer science is simply based on the provided description and common stereotypes.
