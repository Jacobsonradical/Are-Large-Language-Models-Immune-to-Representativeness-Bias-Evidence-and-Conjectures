**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical mind often found in STEM fields, particularly computer science. 
* **Lack of Arts indicators:** While not enjoying drawing or writing doesn't exclude him from humanities, it lessens the likelihood. Humanities professors often enjoy creative writing, literary analysis, etc.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. Personality descriptions are not accurate predictors of profession.
