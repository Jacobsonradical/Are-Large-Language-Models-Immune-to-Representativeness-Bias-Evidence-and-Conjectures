**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, it contains several strong indicators that make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing logic and precision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Creativity:** While the description mentions Jason is highly creative but dislikes drawing and writing, this doesn't necessarily point towards computer science. Creativity is essential in both fields, just expressed in different ways.
* **Small Sample Size:**  100 professors is a relatively small sample size.  Stronger conclusions could be drawn from a larger, more representative sample.

**Therefore, while not definitive, the information provided makes it more probable that Jason is a computer science professor.  A probability of 0.75 reflects this higher likelihood, but acknowledges there's still a chance he could be in the humanities.**
