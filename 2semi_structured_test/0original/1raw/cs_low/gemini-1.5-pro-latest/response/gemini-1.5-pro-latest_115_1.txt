**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the strong emphasis on Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles points towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and are more likely to be enjoyed by someone in that field.
* **Humanities:** While some individuals in the humanities might enjoy these activities, they are not central to the field.

Therefore, based on the available information, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems reasonable. However, it's crucial to remember that this is still an educated guess based on limited information.  Other factors not mentioned in the description could influence Jason's actual profession.
