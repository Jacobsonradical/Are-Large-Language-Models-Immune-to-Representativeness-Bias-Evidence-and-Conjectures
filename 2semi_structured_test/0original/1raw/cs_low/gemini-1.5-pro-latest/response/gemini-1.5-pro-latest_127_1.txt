{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards computer science:

* **Coding:**  Explicitly mentioning coding is a strong indicator of someone in a computer science field.
* **Mathematical puzzles:** A preference for mathematical puzzles aligns more with computer science than humanities.
* **Lack of interest in drawing/writing:** While not all computer scientists dislike these activities, it's more common to find these interests in humanities professors. 

Considering the base rates:

* 25% of the sample are computer science professors.
* 75% of the sample are humanities professors.

The description shifts the likelihood significantly towards Jason being a computer science professor. However, it's not a certainty, hence a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems like a reasonable estimate.
