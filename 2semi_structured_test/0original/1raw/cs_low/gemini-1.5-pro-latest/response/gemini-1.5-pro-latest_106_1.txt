{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the key phrase is "Jason enjoys coding."  This is a strong indicator of a computer science background.  

Here's why this simple phrase outweighs other factors:

* **Coding is fundamental to computer science:**  While some in the humanities might dabble in coding, it's the core of a computer scientist's work.
* **Other interests are less specific:** Enjoying math puzzles and being ambitious are found in both fields. 
* **Creativity is not limited to the humanities:**  Computer science involves a high degree of creativity, just expressed differently than in arts or writing.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment, not a definitive answer.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with an unusual interest in coding, but it's less likely.
