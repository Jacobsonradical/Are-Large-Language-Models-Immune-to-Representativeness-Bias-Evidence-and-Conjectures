{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure based solely on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, traits commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Lack of artistic inclination:** While not all computer scientists dislike drawing or writing, the explicit mention of not enjoying these activities further supports the probability of Jason being in a STEM field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The study's sample size is relatively small, which might not fully represent the diversity within each profession. 
* **Stereotyping:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping.  Personality traits are not exclusive to any one profession. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and computer science professors who are talented artists. 

**Therefore, while not definitive, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems reasonable given the information provided.**
