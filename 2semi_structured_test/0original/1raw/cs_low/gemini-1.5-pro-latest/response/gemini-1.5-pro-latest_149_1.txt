{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based purely on a personality sketch, we can make an educated guess using Bayes' Theorem and some assumptions.

* **Prior Probability:** Initially, there's a higher chance Jason is from humanities. 75 out of 100 professors are from humanities, giving us a prior probability of 0.75.

* **Likelihood:** The description leans towards a computer science profile. Enjoying coding, math puzzles, and being highly creative yet disliking drawing/writing fits the stereotype of someone in a technical field.

* **Assumptions:**  We're assuming the personality description is somewhat informative and not misleading.  

Without precise data on how much more likely a computer science professor is to fit Jason's description compared to a humanities professor, we cannot be exact. However, the description shifts the likelihood enough to make it more probable that Jason is from the smaller computer science group.

**Therefore, while not definitive, a probability of 0.75 seems like a reasonable estimate.**
