**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of aptitudes often found in computer science professionals. 
* **Creativity in context:** While the description mentions Jason is highly creative, it also points out he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing. This suggests his creativity might be channeled in more analytical or problem-solving areas, aligning with computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. Personality stereotypes can be misleading, and there are plenty of creative and analytical individuals in the humanities. The higher probability assigned here simply reflects the provided information.
