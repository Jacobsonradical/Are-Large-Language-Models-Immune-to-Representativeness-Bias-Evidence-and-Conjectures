{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the key phrase is "Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles." These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 

Here's why the probability leans towards 0.75:

* **Sample Size:** The study has 3 times more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25).
* **Strong Indicators:**  The enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles are much more common among computer scientists.
* **Lack of Contrary Evidence:** There is no mention of interests typically associated with humanities, such as history, literature, or philosophy.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's impossible to say with 100% certainty which field Jason belongs to without more data.
