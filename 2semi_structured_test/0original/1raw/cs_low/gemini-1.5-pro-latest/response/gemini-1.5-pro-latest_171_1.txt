{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might point towards Jason being a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it lacks strong indicators for either field. 

Therefore, the most important factor in determining the probability is the sample composition:

* **75 out of 100** professors in the study are from the humanities.
* **25 out of 100** professors are from computer science.

This means there's a **3 times higher chance** (75% probability) that a randomly selected professor from this study is in the humanities compared to computer science.
