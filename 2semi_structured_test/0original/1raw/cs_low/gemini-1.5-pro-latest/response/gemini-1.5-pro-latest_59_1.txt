**Reasoning:**

While there is no mention of Jason's specific profession in the description, there are strong indicators that he might be a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals, including academics.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:**  While not definitive, this might suggest a preference for technical fields over humanities.

Considering these factors, it's more likely that Jason belongs to the group of 25 computer science professors than the group of 75 humanities professors. 

However, it's crucial to remember this is not a certainty. The information provided offers a probabilistic inference, not a definitive conclusion.
