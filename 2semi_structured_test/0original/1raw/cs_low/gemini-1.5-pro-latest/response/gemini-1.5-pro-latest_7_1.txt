**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being described as "talented" in a study about successful academics strongly suggests aptitudes often found in computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further points away from fields where those skills are common, like humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. Personality stereotypes are unreliable, and many humanities professors could easily fit Jason's description.
