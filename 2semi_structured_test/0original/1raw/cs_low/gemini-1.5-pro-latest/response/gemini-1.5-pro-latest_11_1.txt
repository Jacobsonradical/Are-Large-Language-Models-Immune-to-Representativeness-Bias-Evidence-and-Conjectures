{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities. This means there's a higher starting probability (75%) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.

* **Description Clues:** Some aspects of the description might seem stereotypically aligned with computer science (e.g., coding, math puzzles). However, these traits are not exclusive to computer science and can be found in individuals across various fields. 

* **Lack of Strong Indicators:**  The description lacks strong indicators that would definitively point towards computer science over humanities. 

**Conclusion:**

Without stronger evidence, it's more probable that Jason belongs to the larger group (humanities professors) based purely on the initial probabilities given in the study.
