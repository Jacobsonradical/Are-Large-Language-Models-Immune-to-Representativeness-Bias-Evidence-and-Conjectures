{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators that make him more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science and are less common interests in the humanities.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing logic and structured thinking.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  Many talented and ambitious individuals in the humanities could fit Jason's description. The higher probability assigned simply reflects that the provided information leans more towards a computer science profile.
