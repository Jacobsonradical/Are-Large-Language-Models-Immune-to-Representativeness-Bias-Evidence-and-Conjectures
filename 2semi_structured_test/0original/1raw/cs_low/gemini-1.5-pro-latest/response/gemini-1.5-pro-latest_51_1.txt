**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from the humanities, while only 25 are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from humanities and a 25% chance they're from computer science.
* **Description:** The description leans towards stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, math puzzles). However, these traits aren't exclusive to computer science and could easily be found in individuals within the humanities. 

**Conclusion:**

The description provides some evidence leaning towards Jason being a computer science professor. However, the strong base rate of humanities professors (75%) significantly outweighs the information in the description. Therefore, the probability is closer to the base rate of 0.75.
