{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure based on a personality sketch, we can use the information given to make an educated guess. Here's why I lean towards Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Stereotype Match:** The description aligns with common stereotypes of computer science professionals (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles). 
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:**  The description explicitly mentions Jason not enjoying drawing or writing, activities often associated with humanities fields.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample. Stereotypes might not hold true in all cases.
* **Individual Variation:**  Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and some computer scientists are talented artists.  
* **Limited Information:** The personality description is brief. Other factors, like Jason's research interests or teaching style, would be far more informative.

**While 0.75 is my best guess based on limited data, it's crucial to remember this is a probability, not a certainty.**
