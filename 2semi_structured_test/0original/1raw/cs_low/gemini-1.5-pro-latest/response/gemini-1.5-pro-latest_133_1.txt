**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it highlights several traits that align more strongly with the stereotype of a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:**  These are activities heavily associated with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits can be found in both fields, they might be perceived as more typical of individuals drawn to the structured and logic-driven nature of computer science.

**Important Note:**  This probability is based solely on common stereotypes associated with these professions.  It is crucial to understand that:

* **Stereotypes are not always accurate:** Many computer science professors may not fit this description, and many humanities professors might.
* **Individual variation is significant:**  Personality traits within any profession are diverse. 

This exercise highlights how prior beliefs and stereotypes can influence our judgments, even in the absence of direct evidence.
