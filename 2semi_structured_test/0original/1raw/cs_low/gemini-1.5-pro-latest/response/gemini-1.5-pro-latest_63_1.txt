**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the following points lean more towards Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator of an interest in computer science. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Computer science heavily relies on mathematical thinking and problem-solving. 

The fact that Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing might suggest he's less likely to be in the humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own.

**Calculating the Probability:**

* **Prior Probability:**  There's a higher baseline probability that Jason is in the humanities simply because the sample size is larger (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science professors). This gives us a prior probability of 0.75 for humanities and 0.25 for computer science.

* **Updating with Evidence:** The description provides evidence that increases the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor. While we don't have exact numbers, it's reasonable to adjust the probability significantly in favor of computer science based on the strong indicators. 

**Therefore, a probability of 0.75, while not definitive, reflects the updated likelihood based on the provided information.**
