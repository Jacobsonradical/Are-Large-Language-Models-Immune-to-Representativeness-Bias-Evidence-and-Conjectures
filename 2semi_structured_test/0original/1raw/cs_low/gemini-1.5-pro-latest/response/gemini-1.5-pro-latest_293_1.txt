{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain, the description leans towards a computer science professor for these reasons:

* **Strong STEM focus:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset commonly found in computer science.
* **Lack of artistic inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  Personality traits are not exclusive to any profession.  There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and coding!
