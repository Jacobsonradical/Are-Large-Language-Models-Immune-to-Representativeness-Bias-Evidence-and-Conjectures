**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues that might point towards Jason being a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), there's not enough information to definitively say. 

Here's why a probability leaning towards computer science makes sense:

* **Base Rates:** The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor from this group would be from the humanities.
* **Stereotyping:**  While the description aligns with some stereotypes of computer science professors, it's important to avoid making assumptions based solely on these.  Many people in various fields enjoy coding, math puzzles, and might not be interested in drawing or writing. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that this is a probability based on limited information. We don't have enough evidence to definitively determine Jason's profession.
