{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality description, several clues strongly suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are highly aligned with computer science interests.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While some humanities professors might share this, it's less typical of their core work.

The other details (age, family status, conservative) are less informative for this specific distinction. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment, not a guaranteed answer. There could be humanities professors who fit Jason's description, and vice versa.
