**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be seen as stereotypically aligning with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the key to answering this lies in the study's composition. 

* **Sample Size:** The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 
* **Prior Probability:** This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor from the study is in the humanities.

**Without any further information about personality traits and their correlation to academic fields, the larger sample size for humanities professors makes it more likely that Jason belongs to that group.**
