{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, we can make an educated guess based on the following:

* **Stereotypes:**  There's a common stereotype (which may or may not be accurate) that people in computer science enjoy coding, math puzzles, and are less interested in artistic pursuits like drawing and writing. This leans towards Jason being a computer science professor.
* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75% humanities professors and only 25% computer science professors. This means it's initially more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.

However, the description's details ("enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles") strongly align with the computer science stereotype. While some humanities professors might enjoy these activities, it's likely a stronger indicator of being in computer science.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is significantly higher than the base rate of 0.25, but likely not as high as 0.9 or 1.  A probability of 0.85 reflects this balance between the base rate and the descriptive information.
