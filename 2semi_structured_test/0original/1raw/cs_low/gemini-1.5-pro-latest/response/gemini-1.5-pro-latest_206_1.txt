{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information that might seem stereotypically associated with computer science (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles), the sample itself is heavily skewed towards humanities professors (75% humanities vs. 25% computer science). 

Without any further information to strongly suggest Jason is in computer science, the prior probability of him being in the larger group (humanities) has a significant influence. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's no guarantee Jason is in the humanities, and the description might be misleading.
