**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, the most significant factor influencing the probability is the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study. 

* There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
* Conversely, there's a 75/100 = 0.75 probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.

The description aligns somewhat with stereotypes about computer science professors (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles), but these traits aren't exclusive to the field. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid falling into the trap of base rate neglect.  Even if the description strongly suggested a computer science background, we cannot ignore the fact that humanities professors are three times more prevalent in this sample.
