**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study setup:

* **25 Computer Science Professors:** This represents 25% of the total sample.
* **75 Humanities Professors:** This represents 75% of the total sample.

The description aligns with stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, math puzzles), but these stereotypes are not absolute.  

**Without further information, the most statistically sound approach is to lean towards the base rate. Since there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in the humanities, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is closer to the lower end.**

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  A more confident assessment would require analyzing all the descriptions and looking for statistically significant patterns.
