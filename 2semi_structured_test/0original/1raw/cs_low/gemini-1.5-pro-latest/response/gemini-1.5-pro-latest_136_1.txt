{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession from the description, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided. 

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). This means the prior probability of any random professor in the sample being in computer science is 0.25.
* **Relevant Information:** The description highlights Jason's enjoyment of "coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles." These activities are more commonly associated with computer science. 

Considering both the base rate and the relevant information, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, the description also mentions that Jason is "highly creative" but doesn't enjoy drawing or writing. This could be seen as slightly more aligned with stereotypes about humanities professors.

Therefore, a probability of 0.75 represents a reasonable increase from the base rate of 0.25, acknowledging the stronger evidence towards Jason being a computer science professor.
