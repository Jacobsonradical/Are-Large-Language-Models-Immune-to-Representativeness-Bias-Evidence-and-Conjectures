{"probability": "0.75"}
```

Here's why I chose this probability:

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many humanities professors (75) as computer science professors (25). So, the prior probability of any professor being in computer science is 0.25.
* **Stereotypes and Evidence:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes about computer scientists (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles).  While these stereotypes are not always accurate, they do provide some evidence shifting the probability away from the base rate.

* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators of a humanities profession. While not disliking drawing or writing doesn't definitively mean he's *not* in the humanities, it doesn't provide evidence in that direction either.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on stereotypes.  However, the information provided does slightly tip the scales in favor of Jason being a computer science professor.
