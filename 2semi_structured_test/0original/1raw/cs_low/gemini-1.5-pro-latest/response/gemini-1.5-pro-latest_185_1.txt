**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it provides strong hints:

* **"Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles"**: These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **"Highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing"**: This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with a computer science profile.

Considering these factors, it's significantly more likely that Jason is among the 25 computer science professors than the 75 humanities professors.  

**Important Note:** This is a subjective probability based on limited information. The actual probability could be different.
