{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it highlights several traits more stereotypically associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any profession, might be perceived as more common in structured fields like computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while potentially pointing away from humanities, isn't strong enough to counteract the other indicators.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes and limited information. The actual probability could be different. The study design itself might introduce bias (e.g., if psychologists are more likely to pick up on "computer science" traits).
