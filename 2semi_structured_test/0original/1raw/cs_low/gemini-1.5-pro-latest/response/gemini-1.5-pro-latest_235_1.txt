{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on stereotypes, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Commonly linked to computational thinking. 
* **Conservative, careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be perceived as aligning with the structured nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while potentially fitting a computer science type, is not as strong an indicator as the other points.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential biases. It's crucial to avoid strong stereotypes about professions and personality types.
