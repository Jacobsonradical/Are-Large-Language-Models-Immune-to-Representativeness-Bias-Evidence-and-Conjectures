{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with both computer science and humanities professors, some key elements point towards a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science. 
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and analytical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

While it's possible for someone in the humanities to have these traits, they are more common and almost stereotypical for computer science professors. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. There's no guarantee that Jason is a computer science professor.  The base rate of 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors is a significant factor influencing the probability.
