**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues that might point towards Jason being a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we need to rely on the base rates provided in the study to make a statistically sound probability judgment. 

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are from the humanities and only 25 are from computer science. This means there's a higher prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
* **Description:** The description, while suggestive, doesn't offer conclusive evidence that Jason MUST be a computer science professor. Many humanities professors might also enjoy those activities, and the description itself mentions his creativity, which could apply to many fields.

**Calculating the Probability:**

It's difficult to give an exact numerical probability without more information about how predictive these traits are of being a computer science professor. However, given the base rate, it's more likely that Jason is one of the 75 humanities professors. 

The provided probability of 0.75 leans towards Jason being a humanities professor, reflecting the stronger influence of the base rate in the absence of strongly indicative personality traits.
