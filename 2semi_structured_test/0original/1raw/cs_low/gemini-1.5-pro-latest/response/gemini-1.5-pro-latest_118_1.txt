**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the strong emphasis on Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles leans heavily towards a computer science profile. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and strongly suggest an inclination towards the field. 
* **Creative but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:** This detail further reinforces the likelihood of Jason being in a field where creativity is applied in a technical rather than artistic manner.

**Important Note:** The probability is not 1 (or 100%) because the description doesn't definitively state his profession. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and coding as hobbies. However, the provided information makes it significantly more likely he's in computer science.
