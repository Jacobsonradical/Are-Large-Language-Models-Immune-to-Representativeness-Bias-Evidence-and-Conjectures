{"probability": "0.85"}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no guarantees, several clues point towards a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  This is a strong indicator, as coding is a fundamental skill in computer science. 
* **Mathematical Puzzles:** An enjoyment of mathematical puzzles aligns strongly with the logical and problem-solving nature of computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science compared to some humanities disciplines.

It's important to remember that this is just one description and we are working with probabilities. There could be humanities professors who enjoy coding and math puzzles. However, based on the provided information, it's more likely that Jason belongs to the computer science group.
