**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  A strong indicator for someone in a computer science field.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  A common interest for those in analytical and technical fields like computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities. While someone in the humanities *could* have these traits, they are more typical of someone in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  Personality alone isn't a perfect predictor of profession.
