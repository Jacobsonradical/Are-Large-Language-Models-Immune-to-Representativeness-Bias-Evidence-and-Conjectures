**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the key detail is Jason's enjoyment of "coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles". These activities are far more stereotypical of computer science professors than humanities professors. 

Here's why the probability leans towards computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core skills and interests within computer science. It's less common for humanities professors to engage in these activities.
* **Sample Size:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors.  While Jason's description aligns more with computer science, the larger pool of humanities professors needs to be considered.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unusual hobbies, or the study's sample might not be perfectly representative of all professors in these fields.
