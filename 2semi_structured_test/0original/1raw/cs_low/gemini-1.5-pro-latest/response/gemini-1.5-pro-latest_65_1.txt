{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study's setup.

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 25 are in computer science, which means there's a 25% (or 0.25) probability that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science. 
* **75% in Humanities:** This means there's a 75% (or 0.75) probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.

**The Description:**  The description leans towards stereotypes we might associate with computer science (coding, math puzzles). However, these are not exclusive traits, and many individuals in the humanities could also enjoy these activities.

**Conclusion:** Without strong evidence to shift significantly from the base rate, it's more probable that Jason, chosen randomly from this group, is one of the 75 humanities professors.
