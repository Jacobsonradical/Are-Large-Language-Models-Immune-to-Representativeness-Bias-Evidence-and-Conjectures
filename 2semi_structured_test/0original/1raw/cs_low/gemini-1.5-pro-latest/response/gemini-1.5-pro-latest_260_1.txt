**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  Strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset common in computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:**  Creativity is essential in both fields, but the aversion to artistic expression further points towards a technical focus.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.  We're making an educated guess based on stereotypes, which are not always accurate.
