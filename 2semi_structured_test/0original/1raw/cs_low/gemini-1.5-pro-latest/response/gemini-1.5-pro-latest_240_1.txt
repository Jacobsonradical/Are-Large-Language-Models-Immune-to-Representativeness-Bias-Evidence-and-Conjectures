{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the following points suggest a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator directly related to computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This skillset is highly relevant to computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators specifically associated with humanities. While Jason's enjoyment of jogging and family life are neutral traits, his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles significantly tilts the probability towards him being a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, but based on the available data, it's more likely than not.
