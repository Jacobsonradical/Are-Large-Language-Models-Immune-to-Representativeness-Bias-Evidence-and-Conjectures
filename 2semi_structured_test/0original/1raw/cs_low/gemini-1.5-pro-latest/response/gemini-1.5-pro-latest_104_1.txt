**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the detail-oriented and logical thinking prevalent in programming.
* **Talented and ambitious:**  Success in academia generally requires these traits.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as a slight counter-indicator, but it's not definitive. 

**Given the information provided, and considering the higher base rate of humanities professors in the sample (75%), there's a higher likelihood that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors.**
