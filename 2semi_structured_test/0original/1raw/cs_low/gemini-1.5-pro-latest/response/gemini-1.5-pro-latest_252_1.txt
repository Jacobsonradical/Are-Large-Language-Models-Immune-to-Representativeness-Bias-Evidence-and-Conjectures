{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession solely from this description, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability.

* **Prior probability:**  The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

* **Likelihood:** The description leans towards characteristics often associated with computer science:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles: Strong indicators
    * Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing: Might suggest a preference for technical fields.

* **Updating the Prior:**  The description increases the likelihood that Jason is in computer science. While the exact increase is debatable, it's reasonable to assume the probability is now significantly higher than the initial 0.25. 

Since there's a stronger likelihood based on the description, a probability of 0.75 seems like a reasonable estimate. However, it's important to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes.
