**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might seem stereotypically associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles), the key factor is the sample composition. There were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study. 

This means there's a **3:1 ratio** of humanities professors to computer science professors.  Therefore, without any information about Jason, the prior probability of him being a computer science professor is only 25%.

However, the description does provide some information that could potentially shift the probability.  While some traits might seem to point towards a computer science stereotype, they are not conclusive.  Interests like coding and mathematical puzzles, while more common in computer science, are not exclusive to the field. 

**Without strong evidence pointing either way**, the ratio of the sample size should carry the most weight in the probability assessment.  

Therefore, while the probability is slightly higher than the baseline 0.25 due to the provided description, it's still more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors. A probability of **0.75** reflects this, acknowledging the higher prior probability of him belonging to the larger group.
