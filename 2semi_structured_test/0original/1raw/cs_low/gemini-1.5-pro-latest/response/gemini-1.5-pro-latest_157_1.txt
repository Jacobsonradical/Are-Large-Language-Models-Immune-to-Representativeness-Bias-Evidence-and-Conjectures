{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While this is not a perfect prediction, certain aspects of Jason's personality and hobbies point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be associated with the meticulous and detail-oriented nature of programming. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in successful individuals across various fields, so they don't strongly favor either discipline. 
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for logic and systems over artistic expression, potentially more common in computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors are skilled in logical thinking and may enjoy activities like coding. Conversely, many computer science professionals are artistic and expressive.  This response is based on probabilistic reasoning given the limited information.
