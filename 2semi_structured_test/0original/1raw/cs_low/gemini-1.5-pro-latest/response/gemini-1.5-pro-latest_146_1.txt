**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know Jason's profession based on a short description, we can use Bayesian reasoning to make an informed estimate.

* **Prior Probability:**  The study started with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means the initial probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

* **The Description:** The description highlights traits that could be seen as more common in a computer science stereotype (enjoys coding, solving puzzles, logical). 

* **Updating Our Belief:** The description increases the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it's important to avoid extreme jumps in probability.  It's unlikely the description *alone* makes him 90% or 100% likely to be in computer science. 

* **A Reasonable Estimate:** A probability of 0.75 acknowledges the influence of the description while recognizing we still have limited information.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes and limited data. It's crucial to avoid using such reasoning to make real-world assumptions about individuals or professions.
