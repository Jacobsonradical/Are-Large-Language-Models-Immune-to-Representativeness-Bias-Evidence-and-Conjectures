{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While this is not a perfect prediction, we can make an educated guess based on stereotypes and the information given:

* **Stereotypes:** Computer science is often associated with logic, mathematics, and coding, while humanities are often associated with creativity, writing, and drawing. 
* **Description:** Jason clearly enjoys activities often associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles). While he is creative, his dislike for drawing and writing further pushes away from a humanities stereotype.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that stereotypes are not always accurate. There are many creative computer scientists and many humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This answer is based on probabilities derived from limited information and common stereotypes.
