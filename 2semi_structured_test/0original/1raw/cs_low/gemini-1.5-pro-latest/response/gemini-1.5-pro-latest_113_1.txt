{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are some strong indicators that statistically make Jason more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These activities are highly indicative of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Less Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are generally less central to the field compared to humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes.  It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to fit Jason's description, and the sample size of the study is relatively small.
