**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to any field, these traits can be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These are general traits of successful individuals in many fields.
* **Dislike of drawing and writing:** This might suggest a preference for technical fields over those with a strong artistic or literary component.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assessment is based on stereotypes. There are many successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or dislike drawing. 
* The sample size for computer science professors is smaller (25 vs. 75). This influences the prior probability.

The probability of 0.85 reflects a strong likelihood, but not certainty, that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided information.
