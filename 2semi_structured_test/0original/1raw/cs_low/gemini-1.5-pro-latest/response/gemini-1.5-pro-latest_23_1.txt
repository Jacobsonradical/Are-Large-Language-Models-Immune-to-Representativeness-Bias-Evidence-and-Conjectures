{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM Cues:** Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, common traits in computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:**  While not all humanities professors are artistically inclined, the explicit mention of not enjoying drawing or writing makes it slightly less likely he's in that field.

**Important Note:**  Personality descriptions are not reliable indicators of profession. This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information, and the actual probability could be different.
