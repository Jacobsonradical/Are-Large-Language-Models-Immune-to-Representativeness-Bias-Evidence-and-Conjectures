{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no information directly stating Jason's profession, we can make an educated guess based on the provided details. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests an inclination towards a field related to computer science. These activities are more aligned with the typical interests and skills of computer science professionals. 

Considering the study's sample composition (25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.25. However, the description significantly increases the likelihood that he belongs to the computer science group. Therefore, a probability of 0.75 reflects a reasonable adjustment based on the available information, acknowledging that there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
