**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete evidence to definitively say whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) for a randomly selected professor to be from the humanities.

* **Description:** However, the description highlights several traits more stereotypically associated with computer science professors:
    * Enjoys coding
    * Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles

While these traits don't guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, they shift the probability in that direction. 

Considering both the base rate and the description, it's more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors, but not with absolute certainty. A probability of 0.75 reflects this higher likelihood while acknowledging the possibility that he might be a humanities professor with interests in those areas.
