{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates provided in the study:

* **25%** of the professors in the study are from computer science.
* **75%** of the professors are from the humanities.

The description aligns with some stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving puzzles), but these traits are not exclusive to the field. Many people in various professions might share these interests. 

**Without strong evidence pointing towards humanities, the base rate alone suggests a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor.** 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes. We cannot definitively determine Jason's profession from the description alone.
