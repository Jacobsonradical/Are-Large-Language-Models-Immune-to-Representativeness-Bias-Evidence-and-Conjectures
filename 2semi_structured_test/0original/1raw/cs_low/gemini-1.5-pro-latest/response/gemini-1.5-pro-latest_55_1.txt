{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no definitive information stating Jason's profession, the description leans towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any profession, can be associated with the detail-oriented nature of programming.

The description lacks strong indicators of a humanities background.  

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes.  It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to enjoy coding and math puzzles, and for a computer science professor to be artistic.
