**Reasoning:**

While this is not a foolproof assessment, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator for a computer science background.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** Aligns with the logical and problem-solving nature often found in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be seen as fitting with the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly reducing the probability of being in the humanities, though it's not definitive.

**Important Note:** This is based on stereotypes and general observations.  Many humanities professors might also enjoy these activities, and many computer scientists might be artistic. The relatively small sample size of the study is also a limiting factor.
