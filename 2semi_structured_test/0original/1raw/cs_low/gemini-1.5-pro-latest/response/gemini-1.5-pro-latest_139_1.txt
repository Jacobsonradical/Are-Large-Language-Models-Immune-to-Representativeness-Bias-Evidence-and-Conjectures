{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the information leans towards computer science due to these points:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator aligning with computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This skillset is often associated with computer science and related fields.

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities. While creativity is mentioned, it's specifically noted that Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities often associated with some humanities disciplines. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unusual interests, or the sample itself might not be perfectly representative of all computer science and humanities professors.
