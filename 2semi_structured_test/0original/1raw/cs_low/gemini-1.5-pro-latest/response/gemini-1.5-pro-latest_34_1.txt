**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know without more information, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Lack of arts inclination:**  His dislike for drawing and writing, despite being creative, further suggests a preference away from humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:** 25 computer science professors is a small sample size.  Personality traits within that group can vary greatly.
* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies on common stereotypes about computer scientists and humanities professors. These are not universally true.

**Therefore, while not definitive, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems like a reasonable estimate based on the given information.**
