**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  A strong indicator, directly related to the field.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Computer science relies heavily on logic and mathematical thinking.
* **Conservative, careful, talented, ambitious:**  These traits could apply to both fields, but are often associated with success in technical fields.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  While not all computer scientists dislike these, it contrasts with the typical stereotype of humanities professors who often work with language and potentially visual arts.

Considering these factors, the probability is significantly higher than the base rate of 25% (25 computer science professors out of 100). A probability around 0.85 seems reasonable, acknowledging that there can be exceptions and individual variations within any profession.
