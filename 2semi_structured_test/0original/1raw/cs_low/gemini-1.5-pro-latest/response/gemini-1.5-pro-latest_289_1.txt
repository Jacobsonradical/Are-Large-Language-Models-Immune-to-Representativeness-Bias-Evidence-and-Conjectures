**Reasoning:**

While this is not a perfect prediction, certain aspects of the description point towards a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests creativity expressed through technical means rather than artistic ones, again aligning more with computer science. 

**Important Note:** There are no guarantees. The humanities encompass diverse fields, and some professors within those fields may also enjoy coding or possess strong analytical skills. However, based on the provided information, the probability leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor.
