**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided:

* **Prior Probability:** The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a base 25% chance (25/100) that any randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* **Stereotype Matching:** The description aligns with some common stereotypes of computer science professionals: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and might be seen as less interested in artistic pursuits like drawing and writing. 

While these stereotypes are not always accurate, they factor into our intuition. Jason's description makes it *more likely* that he fits the computer science profile than the overall base rate suggests. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on stereotypes.  A larger sample size and more information about how personality traits correlate with academic fields would lead to a more accurate probability.
