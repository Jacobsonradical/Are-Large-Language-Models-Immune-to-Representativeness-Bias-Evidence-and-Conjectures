{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with both computer science and humanities professors, there are stronger indicators towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, could be associated with the meticulous and detail-oriented nature often required in programming.

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities. While Jason is described as "highly creative," the fact that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing makes it less likely he's in a humanities field that often values these skills.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. The actual probability could be different. There are many creative and successful computer science professors who enjoy artistic pursuits, and many humanities professors who might not.
