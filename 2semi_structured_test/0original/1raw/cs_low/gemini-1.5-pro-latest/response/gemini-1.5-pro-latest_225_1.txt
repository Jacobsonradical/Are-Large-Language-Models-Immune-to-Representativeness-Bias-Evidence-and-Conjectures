{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no information directly stating Jason's profession, we can use the provided description to make an educated guess. The description highlights several traits that might be considered more common in a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again aligning more with computer science.

Although these are just tendencies and not definitive proof, they shift the probability in favor of Jason being a computer science professor.  Given the study's sample size (25 computer science professors vs. 75 humanities professors), the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 0.25.  The description significantly increases the likelihood of Jason being in computer science, making 0.75 a reasonable estimate.
