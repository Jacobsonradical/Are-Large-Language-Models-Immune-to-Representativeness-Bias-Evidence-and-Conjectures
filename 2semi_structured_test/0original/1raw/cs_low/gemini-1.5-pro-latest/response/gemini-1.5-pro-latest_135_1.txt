{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the emphasis on specific details leans heavily towards a computer science profile:

* **"Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles"**:  These are strong indicators aligning directly with computer science interests. 
* **"Highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing"**:  This suggests a technical creativity, again pointing towards computer science.

While a humanities professor *could* fit this description, it's less likely. The description doesn't mention typical humanities interests (literature, history, philosophy, etc.). 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer. There's not enough information to be 100% certain. The 0.75 probability reflects that it's significantly more likely Jason is a computer science professor based on the provided information.
