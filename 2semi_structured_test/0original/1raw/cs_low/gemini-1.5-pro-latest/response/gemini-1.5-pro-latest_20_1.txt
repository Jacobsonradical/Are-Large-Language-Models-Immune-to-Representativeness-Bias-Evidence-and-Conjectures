{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to focus on the base rates given in the study:

* **25%** of the professors are in computer science.
* **75%** of the professors are in the humanities.

The description aligns with stereotypes of computer science professors (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles), but these stereotypes are not absolute.  Many humanities professors could also enjoy these activities. 

**Without further information, the base rate (prior probability) is the best estimate.**  It's more likely that a randomly selected professor from this group is in the humanities simply because there are three times as many humanities professors in the sample.
