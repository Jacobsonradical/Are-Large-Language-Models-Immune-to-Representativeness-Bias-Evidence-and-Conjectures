**Reasoning:**

While we don't have definitive proof, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing strongly align with stereotypes and common interests within the computer science field. 
* **Personality:** While traits like "conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, "ambitious" is often associated with success-driven fields like computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, given the information, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
