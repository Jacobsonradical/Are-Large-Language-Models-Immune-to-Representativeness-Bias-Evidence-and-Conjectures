{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information that might seem stereotypically aligned with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles), the key here is the sample size. 

* **75% of the study participants were humanities professors.** 
* **Only 25% were computer science professors.**

Therefore, based purely on the sample distribution and without considering any personality attributes, the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is significantly higher.
