**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues that might be stereotypically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles), the most important factor to consider is the composition of the study sample. 

* **75% of the professors in the study are from the humanities.** 
* **Only 25% are from computer science.**

Therefore, without any other information about Jason's profession, it's statistically more likely that he is one of the 75 humanities professors. The information provided in the description, while potentially biasing, is not strong enough to significantly outweigh this base rate probability.
