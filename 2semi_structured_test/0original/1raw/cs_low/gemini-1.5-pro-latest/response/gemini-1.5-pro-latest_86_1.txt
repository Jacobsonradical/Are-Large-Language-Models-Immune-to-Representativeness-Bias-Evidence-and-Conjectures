**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, it's important to rely on the base rate information provided. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in the humanities and only 25 are in computer science. This means there's a much higher baseline probability (75%) that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

* **Description:** The description has some elements that might be stereotypically associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles). However, these traits are not exclusive to computer science and can be found in individuals across disciplines. 

* **Avoiding Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid letting stereotypical biases overly influence the probability judgment.  

**Therefore, while Jason's description might slightly increase the likelihood he's a computer science professor, the strong base rate makes it significantly more probable that he's one of the humanities professors.**
