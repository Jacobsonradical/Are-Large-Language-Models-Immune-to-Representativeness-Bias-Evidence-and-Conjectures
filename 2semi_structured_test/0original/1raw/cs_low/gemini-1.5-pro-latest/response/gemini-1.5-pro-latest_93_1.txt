**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the following points suggest a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator aligned with computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  This skillset is also highly relevant to computer science. 

The description lacks strong indicators typically associated with humanities professors (e.g., love of literature, history, writing, etc.).  

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, just a higher likelihood given the available data.
