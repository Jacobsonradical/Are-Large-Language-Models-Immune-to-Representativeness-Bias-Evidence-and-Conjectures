{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on stereotypes, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often found in computer science fields.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits align with the detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as a slight counterpoint, but it's not definitive. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and potential biases. It's crucial to avoid stereotyping in real-life scenarios.
