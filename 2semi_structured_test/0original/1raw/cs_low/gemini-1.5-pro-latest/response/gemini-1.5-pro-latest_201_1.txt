**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, we can make an educated guess based on probability and stereotypes (which might not always hold true):

* **Prior Probability:** The sample has 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. So, there's a higher baseline chance (75%) that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

* **Stereotype Alignment:** The description aligns somewhat with common stereotypes of people in STEM fields (enjoying coding, math puzzles).  

* **Lack of Strong Contradictory Evidence:** Nothing in the description strongly suggests Jason *isn't* a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is based on limited information and potential biases.  Personality alone is not a reliable predictor of profession.
