{"probability": "0.75"}

**Explanation:**

While there is no definite answer based solely on stereotypes, we can make an educated guess using Bayes' Theorem and some assumptions:

* **Prior Probability:**  The base rate of a professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25 (25 computer science professors out of 100 total).
* **Likelihood:** The description leans towards traits often associated with computer science: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles. 
* **Ignoring Neutral Information:**  Having a family, being conservative, and enjoying jogging don't strongly suggest one field over the other. Disliking drawing and writing could slightly decrease the likelihood of being in humanities, but it's not definitive.

Since the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor seems higher than the base rate, we adjust our probability upwards from 0.25.  

**Important Note:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is a highly simplified approach. Personality tests are complex, and stereotypes are often inaccurate. This exercise is about demonstrating probabilistic thinking with limited information, not making a definitive judgment about Jason's profession.
