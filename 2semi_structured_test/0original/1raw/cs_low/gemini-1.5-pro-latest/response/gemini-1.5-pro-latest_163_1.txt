{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, there are strong indicators that increase the likelihood of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, might be more commonly associated with fields emphasizing logic and precision. 

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while suggesting he might not be in a humanities field, isn't a strong indicator by itself.

**Important Note:** This estimation relies heavily on stereotypes and probabilistic reasoning based on limited information.  It's crucial to avoid equating probability with certainty.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.
