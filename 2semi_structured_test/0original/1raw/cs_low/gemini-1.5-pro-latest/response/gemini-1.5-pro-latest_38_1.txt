{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards characteristics often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core interests often found in computer science fields.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, aligning with computer science. 

While it's possible for someone in the humanities to have these traits, they are more common in computer science. Given the relatively small sample size, and the stronger association of the described traits with computer science, a probability of 0.85 seems reasonable.
