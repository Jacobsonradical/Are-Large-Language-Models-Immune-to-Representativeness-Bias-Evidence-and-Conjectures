**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are stronger indicators favoring computer science:

* **Coding:** Explicitly mentioning "coding" is a strong indicator of someone in computer science. It's less common for humanities professors to engage in coding.
* **Mathematical puzzles:** Enjoying mathematical puzzles also aligns more strongly with a computer science background.

The other details are less informative:

* **Conservative, careful, talented, ambitious:** These traits could apply to successful individuals in many fields.
* **Married with children:**  Family status is not particularly indicative of either field.
* **Jogging:** A common hobby not specific to any profession. 
* **Not enjoying drawing/writing:** While this might suggest a leaning away from humanities, it's not conclusive. Many people, including those in technical fields, don't enjoy these activities.

**Therefore, due to the strong indicators of "coding" and "mathematical puzzles," the probability leans significantly towards Jason being a computer science professor.**

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, but the available evidence makes it more likely.
