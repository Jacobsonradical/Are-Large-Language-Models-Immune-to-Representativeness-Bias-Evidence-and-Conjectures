**Reasoning:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability, but it's easier to think about it intuitively:

* **Prior Odds:** There's a higher prior probability that Jason is in the humanities (75 humanities professors vs. 25 computer science professors). The ratio is 3:1.
* **Description Influence:** The description leans towards a computer science stereotype (enjoys coding, math puzzles). While not definitive, this makes it *more likely* Jason is in computer science.

Since the description points us towards computer science, even though the initial odds favor humanities, it's reasonable to assume the probability is now higher than the original 25% (25 out of 100) chance.  

**A probability of 0.75 (or 75%) reflects this updated belief.** It signifies we think it's now 3 times more likely that Jason is in computer science, taking into account both the prior odds and the description. 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective probability based on limited information and stereotypes.  We don't have enough data to be precise.
