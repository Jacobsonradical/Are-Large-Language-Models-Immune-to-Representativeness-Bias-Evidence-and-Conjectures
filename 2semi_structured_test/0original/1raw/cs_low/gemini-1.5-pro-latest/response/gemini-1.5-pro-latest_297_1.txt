{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the emphasis on Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles leans heavily towards a personality more common in computer science. 

Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These activities are core elements of computer science and are more likely to be enjoyed by someone in that field. 
* **Sample Size:** The study included 75 humanities professors and only 25 computer science professors. This means a randomly chosen description is statistically more likely to belong to a humanities professor *unless* there are strong indicators otherwise.

**Important Note:** This is still a probability, not a certainty.  The description doesn't rule out Jason being a humanities professor who enjoys coding as a hobby. However, based on the available information, it's more likely he's in the computer science group.
