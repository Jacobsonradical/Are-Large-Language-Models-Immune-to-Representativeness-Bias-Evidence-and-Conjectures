{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without more information, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor for a few reasons:

* **Explicitly enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator aligning with computer science. 
* **Enjoys mathematical puzzles:**  Further suggests an analytical and logical mindset often associated with computer science.
* **No mention of typical humanities interests:** The description lacks any mention of interests like literature, history, philosophy, or art, which are more common in humanities fields.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample, so drawing strong conclusions is difficult.
* **Stereotypes:** Basing the probability solely on common stereotypes about computer scientists and humanities professors is not ideal. There's significant variation within any profession. 

**Overall:** While not definitive, the provided information makes it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. The 0.75 probability reflects this, but with the understanding that there's still a reasonable chance he could be in the humanities.
