{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, the description leans towards a computer science professor profile due to these points:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computational fields.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but the combination with the previous point strengthens the likelihood.

The description doesn't offer strong evidence against Jason being in the humanities. However, the lack of mention of interests typically associated with humanities (like literature, history, or philosophy) combined with the strong computer science indicators makes it more probable he belongs to that group.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. Personality profiles are not deterministic, and many humanities professors could easily fit Jason's description.
