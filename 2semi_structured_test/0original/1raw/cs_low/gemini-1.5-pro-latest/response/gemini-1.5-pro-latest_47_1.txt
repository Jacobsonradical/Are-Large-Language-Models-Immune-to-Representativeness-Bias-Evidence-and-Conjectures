{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no guaranteed way to know Jason's profession from the description, we can use the information to make an informed guess based on probabilities.

* **Base Rate:** The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 prior probability that any professor in the study is a computer science professor, and a 75/100 = 0.75 prior probability they are a humanities professor.

* **Stereotype Matching:**  The description aligns somewhat with common stereotypes about computer science: enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being logical. However, it's important to acknowledge these are stereotypes, and not definitive indicators. 

* **Lack of Strong Evidence for Humanities:** The description doesn't strongly suggest a specific field within the humanities. While it notes Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, this doesn't automatically make him more likely to be in computer science. Many people, including those in the humanities, don't enjoy these activities.

**Conclusion:**

Given the higher base rate of humanities professors in the study and the lack of strong evidence pointing towards Jason being in computer science despite the stereotype, it's more likely that Jason is one of the humanities professors. The provided probability of 0.75 is a reflection of this,
