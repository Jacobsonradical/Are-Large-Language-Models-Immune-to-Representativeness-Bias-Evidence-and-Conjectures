{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based solely on this description, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability. 

* **Prior Probability:**  The study started with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.  This means the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

* **The Description:** The description highlights traits and hobbies that might be considered more common among computer scientists (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles). 

* **Updating Our Belief:** The description increases the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.  While the strength of this evidence is subjective, it's reasonable to assume the probability is now significantly higher than the initial 0.25.

**It's important to note:** This is just an estimate.  The description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field.  A 0.75 probability doesn't mean it's certain he's in computer science, just that it's more likely than not based on the given information.
