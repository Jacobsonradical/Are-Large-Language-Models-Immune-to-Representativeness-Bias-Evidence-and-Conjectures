**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, the most significant factor influencing the probability is the study's sample composition:

* **75% of the studied professors were in the humanities.** 
* **25% of the studied professors were in computer science.**

Therefore, without any information about Jason's profession, the prior probability of him being a humanities professor is higher.  

**However**, the description does include some traits that might be considered stereotypically aligned with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding**
* **Solving mathematical puzzles**

These traits suggest a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor. However, these are just stereotypes, and many individuals in the humanities might share these interests. 

**Considering both the base rate and the stereotypical clues, a probability of 0.75 acknowledges the higher likelihood of Jason being in the larger group (humanities) while still reflecting the increased chance based on his interests.** 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases based on limited information. While the description hints at a possible inclination towards computer science, it's not definitive.
