{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues that might seem stereotypically aligned with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles), the most important factor is the sample composition. 

* There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the study. 
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 chance of a randomly selected professor being from computer science.
* Conversely, there's a 75/100 = 0.75 chance of them being from the humanities.

**Without any further information about how personality traits correlate to academic fields, the base rates of the sample are the most important factor.** It's more likely Jason is a humanities professor simply because there are three times as many in the study.
