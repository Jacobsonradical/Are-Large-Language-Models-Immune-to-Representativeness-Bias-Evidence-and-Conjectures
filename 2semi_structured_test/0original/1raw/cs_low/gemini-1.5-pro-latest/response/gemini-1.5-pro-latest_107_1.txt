{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there is no definitive information stating Jason's profession, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a strong indicator of potential involvement in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** A common interest and skill among computer scientists.
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits could be seen as aligning with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly reducing the probability of being in humanities, though not a strong indicator by itself.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes. There are many creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and even coding. Similarly, there are computer science professors who are artistic.  The provided information does not definitively place Jason in either field.
