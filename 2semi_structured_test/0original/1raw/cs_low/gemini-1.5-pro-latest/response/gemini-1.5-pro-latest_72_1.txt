{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description offers no direct evidence of Jason's profession, we can use the base rates provided to make an informed guess. 

* **Base rate bias:**  We know that 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from the humanities, while only 25 are from computer science. This means there's a higher prior probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

* **Weak stereotypes:** The description offers some details that might weakly align with stereotypes about computer science professors (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles). However, these stereotypes are not strong enough to significantly outweigh the base rate bias.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid falling into the trap of assuming that anyone who enjoys coding or math must be a computer science professor.  The description could easily fit a humanities professor with specific interests. 

**Therefore, while not certain, it's more probable (0.75) that Jason is one of the humanities professors based simply on the higher representation of humanities professors in the study sample.**
