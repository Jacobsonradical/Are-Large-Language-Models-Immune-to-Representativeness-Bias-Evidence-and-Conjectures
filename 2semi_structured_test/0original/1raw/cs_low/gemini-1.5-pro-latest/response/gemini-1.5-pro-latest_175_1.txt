{"probability": "0.75"} 

Here's why:

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, the key piece is "Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles...". These are strong indicators of interests typically associated with computer science. 

Since 25% of the professors are in computer science and 75% are in the humanities, the prior probability is 0.25.  However, the information provided about Jason's interests significantly increases the likelihood that he's in computer science. While I can't assign an exact numerical increase based on subjective information, it's reasonable to estimate a probability significantly higher than 0.25, making 0.75 a more likely estimate than lower values.
