{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it doesn't definitively place Jason in either field. Here's why I lean towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often found in computer science. 
* **Creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests creativity expressed through technical means rather than artistic ones.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Humanities professors can be analytical and enjoy logic puzzles too.** The description doesn't rule out these traits in humanities fields.
* **Sample Size:** The study has three times as many humanities professors.  Even if a smaller proportion of humanities professors fit this description, the raw number could still be significant.

**Therefore, while 0.75 (75%) feels appropriate, it's crucial to remember this is based on limited information and the actual probability could be different.**
