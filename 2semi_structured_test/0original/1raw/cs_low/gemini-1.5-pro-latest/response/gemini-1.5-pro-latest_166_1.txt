{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with either field, there are some strong indicators that lean towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a highly specific interest directly related to computer science. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Strong mathematical and logical thinking is essential in computer science. 

The description lacks any clear indicators favoring humanities. While Jason is described as "highly creative,"  his disinterest in drawing and writing might suggest his creativity manifests in other ways, such as problem-solving and coding.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. More information would be needed for a more definitive answer.
