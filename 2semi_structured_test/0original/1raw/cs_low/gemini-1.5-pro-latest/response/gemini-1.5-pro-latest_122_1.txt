{"probability": "0.75"}

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to be certain based on a personality sketch, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Logical/Mathematical:** Enjoys coding, solving puzzles.
* **Less Artistic:** Dislikes drawing and writing (though "creative" is mentioned, it's not specified in an artistic direction).

The base rate of computer science professors in the study is 25%, but the provided information strongly suggests Jason belonging to that group. Hence, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems reasonable. 

**Important Note:** Stereotypes should not dictate career choices, and many variations exist within any profession. This is a probabilistic inference based on limited data, not a definitive judgment.
