{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based on the description, we can use the information provided to make an educated guess. Here's why:

* **Base Rates:** The study included 75 humanities professors and 25 computer science professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of humanities professors in the sample.
* **Stereotypes:** The description plays into some common stereotypes about computer scientists (enjoying coding, math puzzles). 
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:**  While not definitive, the description lacks strong indicators that would point towards a humanities profession (e.g., love of literature, history, languages).

**Important Note:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual hobbies.
