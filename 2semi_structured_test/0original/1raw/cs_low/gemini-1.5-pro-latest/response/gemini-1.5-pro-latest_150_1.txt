**Reasoning:**

While the description offers some clues, the most significant factor influencing the probability is the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study.

* There were 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100.
* This means there's a 25/100 = 0.25 chance a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
* Conversely, there's a 75/100 = 0.75 chance they are in humanities. 

**While the description might suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, this information alone is not strong enough to significantly outweigh the base probability established by the sample composition.** 

Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains close to the base probability of a randomly chosen professor from the group being in computer science, which is 0.25.  However, the question asks for the probability that Jason is **one of** the computer science professors. Since this is a binary proposition (he either is or isn't), the probability is the inverse of him being in the humanities, which is **0.75**.
