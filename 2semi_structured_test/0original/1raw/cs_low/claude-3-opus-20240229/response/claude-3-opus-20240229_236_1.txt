Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science rather than humanities.

That said, none of these factors are definitive, and successful academics in both fields can certainly have a wide variety of personalities and interests. Many other relevant factors like his specific research focus are not mentioned.

So while I lean towards guessing computer science, I don't have enough evidence to give a probability much higher than chance. My estimate is:

{"probability": "0.60"}
