Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors leading to this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait often found in successful computer scientists. 

3. However, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting more of a technical/analytical bent rather than artistic.

4. The description does not mention any humanities-related interests or traits that would suggest he is more likely a humanities professor.

Of course, there is some uncertainty based on the limited information provided. Not all details about Jason are known, and both computer science and humanities professors can have a range of personalities and interests. But the specific traits and interests listed point more strongly to a computer science background, leading to the fairly high 85% probability estimate.
