Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, again suggesting more of a technical than artistic bent

That said, these are just general stereotypes and associations. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and don't draw or write creatively for fun. And a sample of one person selected at random really isn't enough to draw any solid conclusions.

If I had to put a rough probability estimate on it based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.6"}

But that's a very tentative estimate with low confidence based on extremely limited data. More details about Jason's specific research areas, publications, teaching subjects etc. would be needed to make a more informed guess. The study design and analysis would also need to account for the imbalanced sample sizes between the two groups.
