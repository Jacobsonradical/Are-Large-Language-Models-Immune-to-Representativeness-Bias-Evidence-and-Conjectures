{"probability": "0.8"}

Based on the description, Jason exhibits several traits and interests that are more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities closely related to computer science.

2. He is described as careful and ambitious, which are traits that may be more prevalent among academics in technical fields like computer science.

3. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for more technical and analytical forms of creativity often found in computer science.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. The study included more humanities professors (75) than computer science professors (25), so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being from the humanities.

Considering these factors, a probability of 0.8 seems reasonable, indicating a strong likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description while acknowledging some uncertainty due to the limited information provided and the unequal sample sizes.
