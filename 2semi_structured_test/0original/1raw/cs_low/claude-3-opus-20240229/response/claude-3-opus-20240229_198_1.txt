To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates (the number of professors in each field) and how well Jason's description matches the stereotypical traits of each field.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, we should be cautious about relying too heavily on stereotypes, as there is likely significant overlap in traits between the two groups.

Considering the base rates, if we had no additional information about Jason, the probability of him being a computer science professor would be 25/100 = 0.25.

Given the limited information provided, which seems to slightly favor the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, a reasonable estimate for the probability might be somewhat higher than the base rate.

{"probability": "0.6"}

This estimate takes into account the base rates and the description, but acknowledges the uncertainty involved in making a judgment based on limited information and the risks of relying too heavily on stereotypes.
