To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details that could indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

Relevant details from Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor.
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities.

Considering the base rates and the description, it appears more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more specific information, we cannot be certain.

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability is a rough estimate based on the limited information provided and should be interpreted with caution. More details about Jason's research interests, publications, and academic background would help make a more accurate assessment.
