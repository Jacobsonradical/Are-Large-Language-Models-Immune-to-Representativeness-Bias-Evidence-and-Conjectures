To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information and how strongly it suggests he belongs to one group or the other.

Key points:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This suggests his creativity is more quantitative than artistic, aligning with computer science.
- However, the description does not provide information about the distribution of these traits among the humanities professors, so we cannot say definitively that these traits are unique to computer science professors.

Given the limited information, a conservative estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability reflects that the described traits and interests align more strongly with computer science than humanities, but acknowledges the uncertainty due to the lack of comparative data for the humanities professors in the sample.
