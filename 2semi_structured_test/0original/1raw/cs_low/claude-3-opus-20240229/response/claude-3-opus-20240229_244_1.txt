To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details provided.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Evidence from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

Considering the prior probability and the evidence, the description suggests that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

However, we should be cautious not to overweigh the specific details and underweigh the base rates, as this could lead to the base rate fallacy.

Taking all factors into account, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.70"}

This probability is higher than the base rate of 0.25 due to the strong evidence in favor of Jason being a computer science professor, but it does not entirely dismiss the base rate information.
