Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, there are a few clues that suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science and related STEM fields. 

- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common among humanities professors.

- His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that could align with a rigorous, technical field like computer science.

However, the description lacks definitive information about his actual profession, research focus, or educational background. Personality traits and hobbies provide limited signal. With only 25% of the sample being computer science professors, the base rate would suggest he's more likely to be a humanities professor, absent other information.

Weighing the limited evidence pointing weakly towards computer science against the base rate, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.35"}
