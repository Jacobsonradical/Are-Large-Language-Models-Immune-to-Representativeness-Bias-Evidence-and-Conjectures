Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more toward computer science over humanities.

That said, these are generalizations and many humanities professors could certainly share Jason's interests and traits. Conservative and ambitious people exist in both fields. Having a family also doesn't distinguish between the disciplines.

Without more discriminating information, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 60-70%, but this is a tentative estimate given the limited data. To express this as a single probability:

{"probability": "0.65"}
