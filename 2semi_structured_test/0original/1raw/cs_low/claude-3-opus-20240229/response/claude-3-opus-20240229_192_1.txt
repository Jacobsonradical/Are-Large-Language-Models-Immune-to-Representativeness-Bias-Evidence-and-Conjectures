To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description that aligns with common traits of computer science professors.

Relevant information:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative, a trait that can be beneficial in computer science.
3. Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for more technical pursuits.

However, we should also note that the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as the mentioned traits could also be found among humanities professors.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability is based on the assumption that enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing, are more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. However, without more definitive information, there is still a level of uncertainty in this assessment.
