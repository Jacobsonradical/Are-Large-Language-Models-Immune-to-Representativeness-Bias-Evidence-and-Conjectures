To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the key information given in the description that may indicate his field of study.

Relevant information:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a more technical or analytical creativity rather than artistic creativity often associated with the humanities.

However, it's important to note that the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Some humanities professors may also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles, and some computer science professors might enjoy drawing or writing.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the assumption that enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, along with being creative in a technical sense, are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. However, without more definitive information, there is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor.
