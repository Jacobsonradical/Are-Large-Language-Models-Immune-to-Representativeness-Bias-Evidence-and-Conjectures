Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description, like enjoying coding and math puzzles, seem more stereotypically associated with computer science. However, there are certainly humanities professors who also enjoy those activities, and computer science professors who have large families and engage in physical exercise.

Without more detailed data on the relative prevalence of these traits among the two groups in the sample, I'll estimate the probability conservatively:

{"probability": "0.6"}
