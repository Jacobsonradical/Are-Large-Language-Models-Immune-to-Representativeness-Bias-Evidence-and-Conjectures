Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details stand out that suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more commonly found among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description does not provide Jason's specific research focus or teaching areas, which would be the strongest indicators. Many of the other details, like his age, marital status, personality traits, and jogging hobby, seem less relevant in distinguishing his field.

Given the information available, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This reflects that the described hobbies/interests tilt the odds in favor of computer science, but considerable uncertainty remains based on the limited data provided. More specific info about his research and teaching would allow for a more definitive estimate.
