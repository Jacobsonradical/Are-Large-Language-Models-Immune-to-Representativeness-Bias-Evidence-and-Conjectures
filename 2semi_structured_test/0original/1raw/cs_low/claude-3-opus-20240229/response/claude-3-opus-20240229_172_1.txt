Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors lean towards computer science, like his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles. However, other details like being married with five children don't clearly indicate his field. Without more relevant information to go on, I'd estimate the probability at around 60% that he is a computer science professor, but this is a tentative guess given the description.

{"probability": "0.6"}
