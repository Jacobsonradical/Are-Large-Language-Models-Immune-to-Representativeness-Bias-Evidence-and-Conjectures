Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment of whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he might be more likely to be a computer science professor:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing or writing, despite being highly creative, may also point towards a preference for more technical and analytical pursuits.

That said, these clues are not conclusive, and there could certainly be humanities professors who share these traits. Additionally, the description does not provide information about Jason's academic background or specific research interests, which would be more reliable predictors of his field.

Given the available information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as slightly higher than him being a humanities professor, but not with a high degree of confidence:

{"probability": "0.6"}
