Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more associated with humanities fields.

That said, these are very broad generalizations and there is significant overlap in traits and interests between different academic disciplines. Many humanities professors likely also enjoy coding and math.

If I had to give a probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate with low confidence, based on limited information and broad stereotypes. Much more data would be needed to make an informed judgment about the probability of Jason being a computer science vs humanities professor.
