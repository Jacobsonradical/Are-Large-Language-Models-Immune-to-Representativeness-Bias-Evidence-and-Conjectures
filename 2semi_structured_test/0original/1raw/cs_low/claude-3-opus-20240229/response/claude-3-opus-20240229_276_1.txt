Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors lean towards computer science, like his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles. However, these interests alone are not definitive proof, as some humanities professors may also enjoy these activities. Other details like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

If I had to estimate, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor given his stated interests. But there's still a reasonable possibility he could be a humanities professor. More specific information about his academic background and research would be needed to assess the probability more definitively.
