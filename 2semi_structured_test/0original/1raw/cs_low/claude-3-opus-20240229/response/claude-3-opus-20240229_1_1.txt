Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some of his traits and interests, like enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, may suggest a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor. However, these traits are not necessarily exclusive to computer science.

Given the description indicates Jason is "highly creative" despite not enjoying drawing or writing, and considering computer science often involves creative problem solving, I'd estimate a somewhat higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor compared to humanities. But I don't have enough information to give a highly confident assessment.

My rough estimate given the information provided:

{"probability": "0.65"}
