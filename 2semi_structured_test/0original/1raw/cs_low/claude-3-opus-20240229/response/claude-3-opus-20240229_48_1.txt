Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative, seems more common for computer science than humanities

That said, these are generalizations and certainly many computer science professors enjoy writing while many humanities professors enjoy math puzzles. Conservative political views also seem more prevalent among humanities professors than CS professors on average, but again this varies a lot.

Given the description, I'd estimate around a 65% probability Jason is a computer science professor, but this is highly uncertain given the limited information. So my final answer is:

{"probability": "0.65"}
