To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the traits and interests that may be more associated with computer science versus the humanities.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests an affinity for computer science.
- He is described as highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may be more associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide a definitive answer, as there can be significant individual differences within each group. Additionally, the study has an unequal number of professors from each field (25 computer science, 75 humanities), which should be accounted for.

Given the limited information and the need to make some assumptions, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be:

{"probability": "0.6"}

This estimate is based on the assumption that his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of interest in drawing and writing, makes him somewhat more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, there is still a significant chance that he could be a humanities professor with these traits.
