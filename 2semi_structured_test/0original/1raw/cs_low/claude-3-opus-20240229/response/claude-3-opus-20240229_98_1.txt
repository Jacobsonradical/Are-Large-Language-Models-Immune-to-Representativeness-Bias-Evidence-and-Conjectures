Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities more often associated with the humanities.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide his academic background or research areas, which would be more definitive indicators. Many of the other traits and personal details seem fairly generic and could apply to professors in many fields.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the given description, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this is a very rough guess given the limited data.
