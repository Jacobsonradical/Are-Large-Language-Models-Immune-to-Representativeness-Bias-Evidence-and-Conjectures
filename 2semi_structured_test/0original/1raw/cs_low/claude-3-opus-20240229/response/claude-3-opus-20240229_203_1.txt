To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The base rate (prior probability) of a randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, we should be cautious about relying too heavily on stereotypes, as there can be significant individual variation within both groups.

Considering the base rates and the description, which seems to match some stereotypical traits of computer science professors more than humanities professors, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be somewhat higher than the base rate of 0.25, but not extremely high.
