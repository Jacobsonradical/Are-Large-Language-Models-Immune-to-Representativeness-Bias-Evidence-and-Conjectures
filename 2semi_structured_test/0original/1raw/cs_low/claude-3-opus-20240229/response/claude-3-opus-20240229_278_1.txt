Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a STEM field than the humanities. 

3. Computer science professors are a minority in the overall sample (25 out of 100). Without any distinguishing information, the base probability would be 0.25. However, the description provides several indicators more consistent with a computer science background than the humanities.

Of course, this is still a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. There is certainly a possibility Jason could be a humanities professor who happens to also enjoy math and coding. More details about his specific research focus and published works would help refine the estimate. But based solely on the personality description provided, I believe it is more likely than not that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
