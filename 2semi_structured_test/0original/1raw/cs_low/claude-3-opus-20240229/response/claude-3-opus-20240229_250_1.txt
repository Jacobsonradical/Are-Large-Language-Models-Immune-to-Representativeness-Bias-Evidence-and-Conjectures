Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, hints more towards quantitative rather than verbal creative outlets.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide Jason's educational background or research focus, which would be much stronger indicators. Conservative political views and having a large family also don't clearly distinguish between the two groups.

Given the need to provide a specific probability estimate between 0 and 1 based on the available information, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This reflects that the description provides some modest evidence pointing towards computer science over humanities, but far from conclusively. Substantial uncertainty remains given the limited information. More specific academic and research details would be needed to assign a higher probability to one field over the other with strong confidence.
