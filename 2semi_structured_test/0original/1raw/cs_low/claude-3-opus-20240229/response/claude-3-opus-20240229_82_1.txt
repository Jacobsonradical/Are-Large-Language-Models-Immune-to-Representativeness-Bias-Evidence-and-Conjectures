To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rate (prior probability) and the specific traits mentioned.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Thus, without considering any additional information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Relevant traits:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as there could be humanities professors with similar traits or computer science professors without those traits.

Considering the prior probability and the relevant traits, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be somewhat higher than the base rate of 0.25, but not significantly higher due to the limited information provided.
