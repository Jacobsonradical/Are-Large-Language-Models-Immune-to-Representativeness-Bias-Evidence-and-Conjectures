In order to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information provided and how strongly it suggests he belongs to one group or the other.

Key points in favor of him being a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists
- Highly creative, a trait that can be applicable in computer science
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting more analytical than artistic pursuits

Key points that seem neutral or not strongly indicative either way:
- Being 45, married, and having five children
- Being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious
- Enjoying jogging

Based on the limited information, there appears to be moderately strong evidence of Jason being a computer science professor given his interests and creativity applying more to that field. However, the description is brief and doesn't rule out the possibility of him being a humanities professor.

As a rough estimate considering the 1:3 ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample, and the description providing moderate support for him being a computer scientist, I'd estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.6"}
