Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, may point towards computer science. However, other traits like being married with five children don't necessarily indicate his academic field.

Without more data on the overall demographics and interests of the two groups of professors in the study, I don't feel there's enough evidence to strongly conclude either way. As a rough estimate, I'd put the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.6"}

But this is a tentative guess based on very limited data. More context about the typical traits of professors in each field would be needed to meaningfully distinguish them based on a brief personality description like this. The study results as a whole could provide insight, but this single data point is not conclusive.
