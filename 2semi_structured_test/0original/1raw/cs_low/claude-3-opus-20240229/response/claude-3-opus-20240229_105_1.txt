Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science rather than humanities fields where those activities are often important.

- Careful, analytical thinking is important in computer science.

That said, these are stereotypes and many computer science and humanities professors break the mold. Conservative political views and having a large family don't necessarily indicate field of study. And talents, ambition and jogging are not unique to either discipline.

Without more definitive information, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.65. But this is a tentative guess based on limited data prone to stereotyping.
