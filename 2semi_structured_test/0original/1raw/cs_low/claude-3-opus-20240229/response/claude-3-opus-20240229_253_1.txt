To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical or analytical creativity over artistic pursuits.
3. The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25/100 = 0.25.

Given the strong evidence of Jason's interests aligning with computer science and the relatively low base rate of computer science professors in the sample, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be higher than the base rate but not overwhelmingly high.
