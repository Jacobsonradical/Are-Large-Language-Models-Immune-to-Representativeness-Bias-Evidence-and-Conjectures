Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may point away from humanities. 

- Certain traits like being careful and ambitious could align with a systematic, analytical thinker.

That said, these are generalizations and many humanities professors certainly enjoy math and coding while many CS professors are avid writers. The description is too brief to make a highly confident determination.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on limited data and stereotypical associations. Many more details about Jason's background, research focus, and other traits would be needed to meaningfully predict his department with confidence. The 65% probability mainly reflects that the description provides slightly more evidence pointing to CS than humanities in my estimation, but it's far from definitive.
