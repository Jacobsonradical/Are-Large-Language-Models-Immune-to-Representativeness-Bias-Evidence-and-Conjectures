Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors pointing to him being a computer science professor are his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, tenured professors in many fields may enjoy logic puzzles as a hobby. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing could point away from humanities, but this is also far from conclusive.

Without more information directly related to his field of study and academic work, I don't feel there is strong enough evidence to heavily favor his being in one field over the other. As a rough estimate, I'd say there's a 60% chance he's a computer science professor, but this probability is not much better than a coin flip given the information we have.
