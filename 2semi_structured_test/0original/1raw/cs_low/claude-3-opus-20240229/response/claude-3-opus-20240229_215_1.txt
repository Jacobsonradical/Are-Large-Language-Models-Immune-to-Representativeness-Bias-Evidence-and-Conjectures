To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rate (the proportion of CS professors in the sample) and how representative Jason's traits are of a typical CS professor versus a humanities professor.

Given information:
- 25 out of the 100 professors are in computer science (CS)
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with CS
- However, the description also includes some irrelevant information, like his age, marital status, and number of children

Reasoning:
The base rate of CS professors is 25%, so without any additional information, the probability would be 0.25.

Jason's enjoyment of coding and math puzzles is indicative of a CS background, increasing the probability. However, the other personal details don't strongly suggest one field over the other.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability to be higher than the base rate, but not overwhelmingly so, as the description also contains ambiguous information.

{"probability": "0.6"}
