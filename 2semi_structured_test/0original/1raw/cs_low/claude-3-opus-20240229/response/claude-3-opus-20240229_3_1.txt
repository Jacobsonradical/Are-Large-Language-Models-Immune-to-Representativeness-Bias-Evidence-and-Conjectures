Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer scientists.

2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. This fits the typical profile of computer scientists.

3. His personality is described as conservative, careful, talented and ambitious. While this could fit academics in many fields, the combination with his specific interests suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

Of course, this is an estimated probability based on limited information and stereotypical assumptions. There is still a reasonable chance that Jason could be a humanities professor who happens to have some interests and traits more commonly associated with computer scientists. A definitive answer would require more specific information about his academic field and research.
