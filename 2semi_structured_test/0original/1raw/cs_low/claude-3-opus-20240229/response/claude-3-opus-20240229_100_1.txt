Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer scientists.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may manifest more in technical/analytical domains rather than artistic ones. 

- Computer science skews more male than humanities, so being male provides a small probabilistic signal toward CS (though there are of course many male humanities professors).

- Personality traits like being careful and ambitious are common across academia and not strongly indicative either way.

Without more definitive information about educational background, research focus, etc., I'll refrain from giving an overly confident estimate. But weighing the limited evidence, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}
