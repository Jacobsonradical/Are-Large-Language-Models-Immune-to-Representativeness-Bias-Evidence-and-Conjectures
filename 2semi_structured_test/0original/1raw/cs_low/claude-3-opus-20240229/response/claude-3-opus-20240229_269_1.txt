To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided in his description that aligns with common traits of computer science professors.

Relevant information:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
2. He is described as highly creative, a trait that can be beneficial in computer science.
3. Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for more technical and analytical activities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as the mentioned traits could also be found among humanities professors.

Given the limited information and the fact that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be slightly higher than the baseline probability of 25%.
