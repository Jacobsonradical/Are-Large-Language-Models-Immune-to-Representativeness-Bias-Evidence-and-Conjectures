To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how his traits align with the stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Many of his other traits, such as being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, could apply to professors in either field.

Considering the base rates, there is a 25% (25/100) prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.

Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, along with his dislike for drawing and writing, suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor. However, this evidence is not conclusive.

Considering all factors, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be higher than the base rate of 25% but not approaching certainty.
