Based on the given description, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests he likely applies his creativity more to technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. This fits the typical profile of a computer science professor.

3. Traits like being careful and ambitious are common among successful academics in general, so while relevant, they are less specific in distinguishing his likely field.

4. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or tendencies that would make it more likely for Jason to be a humanities professor.

Of course, without more specific information it's impossible to say definitively, but the described characteristics point to a high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample.
