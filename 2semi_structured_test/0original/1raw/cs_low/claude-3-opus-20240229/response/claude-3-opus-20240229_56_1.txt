Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1) He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are very typical interests for computer scientists.

2) He is described as highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical in nature.

3) His personality is described as conservative, careful, and ambitious, traits that seem more aligned with a technical field than the humanities.

4) With 5 children at age 45, he likely has a stable, high-paying career, which is more probable as a tenured professor in computer science compared to the humanities.

However, without more definitive information about his career, education, and skills, I cannot say with 100% certainty that he is a computer science professor, hence an 80% probability estimate rather than 100%.
