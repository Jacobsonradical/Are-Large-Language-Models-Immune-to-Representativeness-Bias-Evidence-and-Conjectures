Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical pursuits rather than artistic ones often associated with the humanities.
- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities, so him being a man provides a small signal in that direction, although the gender split among tenured professors may be more balanced.

That said, these are imperfect stereotypes and signals. Plenty of humanities professors enjoy math and coding, and a computer science professor could certainly enjoy drawing and writing. The description doesn't provide any slam-dunk giveaways.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 70%:
