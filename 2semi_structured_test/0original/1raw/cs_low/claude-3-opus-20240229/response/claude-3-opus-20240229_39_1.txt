Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His personality traits of being careful and ambitious align with common perceptions of successful computer scientists. 

3. While he is described as highly creative, his dislike of drawing and writing suggests his creativity may be more technical or analytical in nature, as is often the case in computer science.

4. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or inclinations.

Of course, this is a subjective estimate based on limited information and general stereotypes. Without more detailed data on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups in the sample, a high degree of confidence is not warranted. Nonetheless, the description intuitively seems more likely to fit a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
