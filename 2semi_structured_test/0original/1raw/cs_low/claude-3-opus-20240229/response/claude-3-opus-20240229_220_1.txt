Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic/verbal  

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile and computer science professors who do not.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But this estimate should be taken with a big grain of salt, as it relies on stereotypes and very limited data. Many more details about Jason's background, research, teaching, and personality would be needed to make a truly informed guess about his field with strong confidence.
