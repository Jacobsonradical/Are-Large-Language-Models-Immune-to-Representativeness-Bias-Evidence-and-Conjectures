Given the limited information provided, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the details in the description, I'll make my best estimate:

Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also aligns more with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

However, the description doesn't provide clear evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Additional information about his research focus, publications, and academic background would help make a more informed estimate.

Considering the study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%.

Weighing the limited evidence suggesting Jason may be a computer science professor against the base rate, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
