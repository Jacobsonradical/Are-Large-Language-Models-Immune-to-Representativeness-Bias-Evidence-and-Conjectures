Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, artistic pursuits more commonly associated with the humanities.

At the same time, having 5 children at age 45 could slightly tilt the odds toward him being a humanities professor, if we assume computer science professors may on average have children later. But this is a very rough demographic generalization.

Weighing the various factors, I'd estimate about a 70% probability Jason is a computer science professor based on the description. But more information would be needed to have strong confidence either way.
