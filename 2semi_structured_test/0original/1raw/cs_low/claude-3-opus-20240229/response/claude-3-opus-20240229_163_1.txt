Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest a slightly higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, it's important to note that these are generalizations and there can certainly be exceptions. Many factors that could provide stronger evidence, such as his specific research interests or publications, are not mentioned in the description.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as slightly higher than him being a humanities professor, but not by a large margin.
