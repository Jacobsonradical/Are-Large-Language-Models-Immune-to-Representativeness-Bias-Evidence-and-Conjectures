Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment of drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic/literary. 

- Computer science professors are a minority in the overall sample (25% vs 75% humanities), so absent other information, a random individual is more likely to be a humanities professor. However, the details provided for Jason seem to point more towards computer science.

Without more data on the overall demographics and personalities of the two groups, I'll make a rough estimate that the probability Jason is a computer science professor is 60%:

{"probability": "0.6"}
