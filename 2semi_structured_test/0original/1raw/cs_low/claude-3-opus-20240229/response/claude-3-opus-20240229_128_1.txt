Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either group. However, a few clues suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science than the humanities 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities that humanities professors may be more inclined towards

That said, this is far from conclusive based on a short description. Plenty of computer science professors enjoy drawing and writing, and some humanities professors enjoy math and coding. His other traits and family details don't clearly distinguish between the groups.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on this description, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But I wouldn't be highly confident in that assessment given the limited information.
