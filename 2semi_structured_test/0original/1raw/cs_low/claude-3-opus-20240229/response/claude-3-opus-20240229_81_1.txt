To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the distinguishing characteristics mentioned.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

The base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description suggests that Jason has traits and interests that are more aligned with computer science than the humanities. Therefore, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be higher than the base rate.

However, we should be cautious not to overestimate the probability, as the description does not provide conclusive evidence that he is a computer science professor.

Considering these factors, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be around 0.6 to 0.7.
