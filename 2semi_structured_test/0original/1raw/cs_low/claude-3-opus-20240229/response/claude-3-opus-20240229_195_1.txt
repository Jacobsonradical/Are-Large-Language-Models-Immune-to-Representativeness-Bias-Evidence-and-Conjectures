Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either category. However, a few points suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more common for quantitative fields than the humanities, which often involve writing

That said, these are only slight probabilistic hints based on stereotypes. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and computer science professors who enjoy art. More individualized information about his academic work and thinking style would be needed for a confident assessment.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.6"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate with high uncertainty based on limited information. More details about Jason's work, research and intellectual pursuits would be needed to make a truly informed estimate.
