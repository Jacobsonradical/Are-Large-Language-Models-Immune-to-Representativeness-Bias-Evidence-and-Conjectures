Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details stand out that suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description does not provide Jason's actual field, and many of the other traits and biographical details could apply to professors in either discipline.

Weighing the available evidence, I'd estimate a 60-65% probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. But substantial uncertainty remains given the limited information provided.
