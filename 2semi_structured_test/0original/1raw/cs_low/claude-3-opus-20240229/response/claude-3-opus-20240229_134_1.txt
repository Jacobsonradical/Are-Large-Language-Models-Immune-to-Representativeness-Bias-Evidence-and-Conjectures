Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could suggest more technical/analytical creative outlets, which may be more common in computer science

At the same time, the description doesn't provide strong differentiating factors, as professors in both fields could certainly enjoy coding, math and jogging. Conservatism, carefulness, talent and ambition are also traits that could easily apply to successful professors in either field.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited discriminating information, I'd estimate there is a moderately higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor, but not an overwhelming likelihood. My estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.65"}
