To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details that might indicate his field.

Given information:
- 25 professors are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.

The base rate suggests a 25% chance (25/100) that a randomly selected professor from the sample is in computer science. However, Jason's interests align more with computer science than the humanities.

Considering the base rate and the specific details, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is higher than the base rate because Jason's described interests and traits are more consistent with a computer science background. However, there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
