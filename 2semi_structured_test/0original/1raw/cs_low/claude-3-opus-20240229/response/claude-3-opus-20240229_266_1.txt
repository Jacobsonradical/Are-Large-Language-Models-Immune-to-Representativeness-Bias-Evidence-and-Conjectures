Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, it is difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities

On the other hand, the description doesn't provide strong evidence either way, as both computer science and humanities professors could potentially be conservative, careful, talented, ambitious and enjoy jogging.

Given the study interviewed 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor is 25%. 

Weighing the base rate along with the mild evidence pointing towards computer science, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be around 60%:
