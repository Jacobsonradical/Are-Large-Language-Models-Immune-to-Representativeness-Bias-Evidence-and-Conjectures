Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities.

However, many other details like his family status, personality traits, and jogging hobby seem fairly neutral between the two fields. And the humanities are a very broad area - he could potentially be in a more technical/analytical humanities field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But more information would be needed to assign a probability with strong confidence.
