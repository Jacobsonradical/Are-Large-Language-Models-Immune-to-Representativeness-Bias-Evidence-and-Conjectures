Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, seem more stereotypically associated with computer science. However, these traits are not exclusive to that field, and other details like being married with five children don't clearly distinguish between the two groups.

Given the study sampled more humanities professors overall (75) compared to computer science professors (25), if I had to guess, it seems more likely Jason would be one of the larger number of humanities professors sampled. But again, the description doesn't provide enough clear differentiating information to make a confident assessment.

If I had to put a probability estimate, I would say:

{"probability": "0.35"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate given the limited information to go on. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publication record, or other academic background would help make a more informed estimate. The provided description focuses on fairly generic personality traits and hobbies that don't definitively place him in either group with high confidence.
