Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to assess with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical/logical than artistic

At the same time, the description doesn't provide strong evidence either way, as both computer science and humanities professors could be conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, married with children, and enjoy jogging.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'd say there's a moderately higher chance of Jason being a computer science professor. But I wouldn't put the probability too high given the uncertainty.
