To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details that may indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

Evidence from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of computer science professors.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with humanities professors.

Considering the base rates and the description, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we should be cautious not to overweight the specific details and underweight the base rates.

A reasonable estimate might be:

{"probability": "0.70"}

This estimate takes into account the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (0.25) and adjusts it upward based on the description's details that suggest he is more likely to be in computer science. However, it does not completely ignore the base rates in favor of the specific details.
