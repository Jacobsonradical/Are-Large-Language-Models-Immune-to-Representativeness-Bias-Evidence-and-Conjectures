Based on the given description, here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests a greater affinity for technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. This fits the typical profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

3. While the description provides relevant details about Jason's personality and interests, it does not definitively identify his profession. There remains some possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. Hence, I estimate a high but not absolute probability of him being a computer science professor.
