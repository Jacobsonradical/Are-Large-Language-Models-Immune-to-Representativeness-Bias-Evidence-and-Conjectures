Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. While he is described as highly creative, his lack of interest in drawing and writing suggests his creative outlets align more with computer science.

3. His other traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields.

4. The sample included 25 computer science professors and 75 in humanities, so the base rate probability of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor is 25%. 

However, the specific details pointing to interests and skills in coding and mathematics make it more likely than the base rate that Jason is a computer science professor, so I estimated a 75% probability. Of course, without more specifics it's impossible to say definitively.
