From the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors pointing to computer science are his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles. However, simply enjoying these activities does not necessarily mean he is a computer science professor, as professors in quantitative fields of the humanities may also enjoy such hobbies. Other details like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious, as well as enjoying jogging, do not clearly distinguish between the two professor groups.

Given the base rates of 25% computer science and 75% humanities professors in the sample, and without other strongly discriminating information in the description, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at slightly above the 25% base rate, but not dramatically higher.
