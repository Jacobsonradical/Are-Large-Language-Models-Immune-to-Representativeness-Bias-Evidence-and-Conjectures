To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the key characteristics and hobbies mentioned:

Key characteristics:
- Conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious
- Highly creative

Hobbies:
- Coding
- Solving mathematical puzzles
- Jogging
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing

The hobbies of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggest that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing aligns more with a computer science background.

However, it's important to note that the given characteristics (conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Considering the strong alignment of Jason's hobbies with computer science and the fact that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
