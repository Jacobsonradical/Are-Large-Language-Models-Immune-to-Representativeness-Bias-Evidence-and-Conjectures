To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the relevant information provided.

Key points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typical interests for computer science professors.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical and analytical tasks over artistic pursuits.
3. The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Given Jason's interests and the fact that they align more closely with those expected of a computer science professor, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be higher than the prior probability.

{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the limited information provided and the assumption that his interests and personality traits are more consistent with those of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it's important to note that this is a subjective assessment and more information would be needed for a more accurate prediction.
