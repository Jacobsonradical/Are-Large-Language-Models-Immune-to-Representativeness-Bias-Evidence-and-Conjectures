To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rate (the proportion of computer science professors in the sample) and how representative Jason's traits are of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The base rate of computer science professors is 25/100 = 0.25.

Jason's traits that are potentially more representative of computer science professors:
1. Enjoys coding
2. Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles
3. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing

Considering the base rate and the representativeness of Jason's traits, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.70"}

This probability is higher than the base rate of 0.25 because Jason's traits seem more representative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not provide a definitive answer.
