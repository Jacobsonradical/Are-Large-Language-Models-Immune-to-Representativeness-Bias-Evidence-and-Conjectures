Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. However, certain details in the description suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer scientists. On the other hand, the description doesn't mention any humanities-related interests.

Without more data on the relative prevalence of these traits among the two groups, I'll make an educated guess and assign a probability of 0.7 that Jason is a computer science professor. But I want to emphasize this is a highly tentative estimate given the limited information.

{"probability": "0.7"}
