To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details provided.

Prior probabilities:
- 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science (25%)
- 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (75%)

Relevant details from Jason's description:
- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical pursuits over artistic ones.

While the description doesn't explicitly state Jason's field, his interests and preferences align more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors.

Given the base rate of 25% for computer science professors and the description that suggests a higher likelihood of Jason being in computer science, a reasonable estimate for the probability would be higher than the base rate.

{"probability": "0.7"}

This estimate reflects the prior probability and the description's indication of Jason's likely field, but it's important to note that this is still a subjective assessment based on limited information and stereotypes. More data would be needed to make a truly accurate determination.
