Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key pieces of information that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more analytical/logical rather than artistic/expressive, which fits better with computer science than humanities.

3. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or activities.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the information provided is limited and does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The description of being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful academics in many fields. Additional information about his specific research focus, publications, or academic background would allow a more definitive assessment.
