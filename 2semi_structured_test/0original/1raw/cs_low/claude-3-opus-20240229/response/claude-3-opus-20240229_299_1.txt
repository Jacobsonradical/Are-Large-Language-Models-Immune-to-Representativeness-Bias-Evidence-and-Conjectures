Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide strongly conclusive evidence either way. Many details, like his marital status, number of children, and other personality traits, don't clearly point to either field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the given information, I would say there is perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But there is still significant uncertainty.
