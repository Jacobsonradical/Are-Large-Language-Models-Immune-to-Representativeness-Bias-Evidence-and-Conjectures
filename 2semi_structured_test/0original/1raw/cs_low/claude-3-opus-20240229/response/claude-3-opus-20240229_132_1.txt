To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the traits and interests that may be more associated with computer science versus the humanities.

Relevant information:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests an affinity for computer science.
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as there could be exceptions and individual differences among professors in both fields.

Given the limited information, a reasonable estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability suggests that while the description contains traits and interests more commonly associated with computer science, there is still some uncertainty due to the small sample size and potential for individual differences among professors.
