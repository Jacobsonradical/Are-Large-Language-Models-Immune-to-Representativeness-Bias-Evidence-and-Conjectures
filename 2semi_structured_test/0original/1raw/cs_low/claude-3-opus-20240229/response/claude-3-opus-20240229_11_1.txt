Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors leading to this probability estimate are:

1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science interests.

2) His lack of interest in drawing and writing despite being creative suggests more technical/analytical creative outlets, again pointing towards computer science. 

3) Personality traits like being careful and ambitious are common in both fields, but slightly more stereotypical of STEM fields like computer science.

4) Demographics like being a 45-year-old married man are largely uninformative here.

So while we can't be certain, the description contains several strong indicators that Jason is more likely to be one of the computer science professors in the sample. A probability of 0.8 reflects being reasonably confident but allowing for some uncertainty.
