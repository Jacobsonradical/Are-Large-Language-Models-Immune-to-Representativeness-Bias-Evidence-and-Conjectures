Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to conclusively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, certain aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science than the humanities.

That said, the other details like his age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields. Enjoying jogging is also not a clear indicator either way.

So while the description suggests a tilt towards computer science, there's still significant uncertainty. As a rough estimate, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This probability could easily be off though, given the limited information to work with. More details about his research focus, academic background, and specific creative outlets would help refine the estimate.
