To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the key information provided in the description that may be relevant:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being creative. This may suggest a preference for more technical and analytical forms of creativity.
3. No information is provided about his specific academic interests or research areas within the humanities.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

However, the description of Jason's interests and preferences seems to align more closely with those typically associated with computer science. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be higher than the prior probability.

While there is no definitive answer without more information, based on the given description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor could be around 0.6 to 0.7.
