To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Given information:
- 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors (prior probability of 0.25)
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science
- Jason is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities

The description suggests that Jason has traits more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. However, we should be cautious not to overweight this information and neglect the base rates.

Considering both the base rates and the description, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be higher than the prior probability of 0.25, but not dramatically so.

{"probability": "0.6"}
