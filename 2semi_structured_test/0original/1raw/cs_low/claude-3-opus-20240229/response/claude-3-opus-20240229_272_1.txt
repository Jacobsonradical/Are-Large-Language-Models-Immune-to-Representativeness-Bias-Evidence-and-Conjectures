To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the key characteristics mentioned that align with typical traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors.

Relevant points:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than humanities.
- He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative. This suggests his creativity is more oriented towards technical fields rather than artistic pursuits often found in the humanities.

However, there are some points that don't provide clear differentiation:
- Being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields.
- Jogging as a hobby doesn't particularly align with either field.
- His age and family status don't give a strong indication of his profession.

Given the limited information, the description suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor, mainly due to his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing.

However, since the description doesn't provide definitive evidence, I would estimate the probability to be around 70-80%.
