Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns with common interests of computer science professors
- His dislike of drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate less interest in humanities subjects

At the same time, other details like being married with five children, and enjoying jogging, don't clearly distinguish between the two groups. Conservative and ambitious personality traits could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Given the study included 3 times as many humanities professors as computer science professors, the base rate probability of any random profile being a computer science professor is 25%. 

Weighing the base rate with the mild evidence pointing towards computer science based on Jason's hobbies, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.4"}

But I wouldn't be at all surprised if this estimate is incorrect, given the very limited information to distinguish the two groups in Jason's description. Much more detail would be needed to assign a high-confidence probability.
