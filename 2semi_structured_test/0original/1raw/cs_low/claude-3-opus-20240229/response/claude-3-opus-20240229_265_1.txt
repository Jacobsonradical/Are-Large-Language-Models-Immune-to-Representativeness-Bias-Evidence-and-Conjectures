Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are often associated with computer science, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is just an educated guess based on the description provided. More information about Jason's specific research interests, publications, and academic background would be needed to make a more accurate assessment.
