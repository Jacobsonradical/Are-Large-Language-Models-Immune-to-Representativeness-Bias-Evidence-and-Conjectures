To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to look for characteristics that align more with computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests he may be a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.

However, other information like his age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious) could apply to professors from both groups and are not strongly indicative of his field.

Given the limited information strongly suggesting Jason is a computer science professor and the lack of information pointing towards the humanities, I would estimate the probability to be higher than 50% but not near certainty.
