Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creative outlets are more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

3. Computer science professors made up 25% of the overall sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 25% base rate probability of Jason being a CS professor. The details in his description seem to point strongly to CS rather than humanities.

Of course, this is still ultimately a probability estimate based on limited information. Not all computer science professors will fit this profile and some humanities professors may share some of these traits. But the description overall seems to me to be more representative of a stereotypical CS professor, leading to my 80% probability estimate.
