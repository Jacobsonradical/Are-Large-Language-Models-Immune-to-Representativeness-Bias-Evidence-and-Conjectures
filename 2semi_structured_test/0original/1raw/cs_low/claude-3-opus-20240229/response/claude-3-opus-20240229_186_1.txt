Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could suggest more technical/analytical creative outlets, which would align with computer science

At the same time, the description doesn't provide any conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Many traits and personal details are not strongly predictive of academic field.

Given the need to provide a specific probability estimate despite the uncertainty, I'll say there is a 60% chance Jason is a computer science professor. This reflects that the description leans in that direction but is far from definitive.
