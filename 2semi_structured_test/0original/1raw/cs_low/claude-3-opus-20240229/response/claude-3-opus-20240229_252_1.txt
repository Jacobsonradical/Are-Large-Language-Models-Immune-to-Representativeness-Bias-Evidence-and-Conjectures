Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he is more likely to be in computer science than the humanities.

3. However, the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor, as the study looks at "successful" professors who may have some atypical traits or interests for their field. 

4. The description also provides some personal details (age, marital status, children) that don't strongly point to either field.

So while the probability seems to favor computer science based on Jason's hobbies and creative inclinations, I don't feel there is enough certainty to give an estimate above 75%. More specific information about his research focus or academic background would help refine the estimate further.
