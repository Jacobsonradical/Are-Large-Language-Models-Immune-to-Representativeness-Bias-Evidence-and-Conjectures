Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative. This also points more towards computer science than humanities.

3. The base rates in the sample - 25% are computer science professors and 75% are humanities professors. Without any other information, Jason would have a 25% chance of being a computer science professor.

However, there is still significant uncertainty given the limited information provided. Personality traits and hobbies are not definitive predictors of academic field. More details about Jason's specific research focus and academic background would allow for a more precise estimate.
