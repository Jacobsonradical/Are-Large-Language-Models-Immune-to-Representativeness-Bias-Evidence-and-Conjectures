Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields.

- His lack of enjoyment in creative writing and drawing may indicate less interest in the humanities. 

- Descriptions of being careful, ambitious and not very artistic align with some stereotypes of computer scientists and engineers.

However, these are broad generalizations and there is significant overlap in traits between academic fields. Many details, like his family status and exercise habits, seem unrelated to his profession. More definitive information about his research focus and academic background would be needed to have high confidence in his field.

Given the need to make a probabilistic estimate based only on the description provided, I'd say there is a moderate probability Jason is a computer science professor, but significant uncertainty remains. Here is my estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
