To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the characteristics that may be more associated with computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Relevant characteristics:
1. Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely related to computer science.
2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

Less relevant characteristics:
1. Age, marital status, and number of children.
2. Being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, as these traits could apply to successful professors in both fields.
3. Jogging, as this is a neutral activity.

Given that Jason enjoys activities more closely related to computer science and does not enjoy activities more often associated with the humanities, there is a higher probability that he is a computer science professor. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence, and there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor.

Considering the available information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
