To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This may suggest a preference for more technical or analytical forms of creativity.
- Other details like his age, marital status, number of children, and enjoying jogging are likely less relevant in determining his field of study.

Given that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Considering the description, particularly Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

However, the information is not conclusive, as there could be humanities professors who share these traits or computer science professors who do not.

Balancing the prior probability and the relevant information from the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.6 to 0.7.
