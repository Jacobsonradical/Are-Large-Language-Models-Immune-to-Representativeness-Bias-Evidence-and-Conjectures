Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related technical fields.

- He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This could suggest his creativity is expressed more through technical or analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones often associated with the humanities.

- No information is provided about Jason's specific interests in humanities subjects.

That said, these clues are far from definitive. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy coding and math, and many computer scientists who have strong interests in humanities subjects as well.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This reflects that the description provides some signals pointing to computer science, but there is still significant uncertainty. More specific information about Jason's academic background and research interests would be needed to answer with higher confidence.
