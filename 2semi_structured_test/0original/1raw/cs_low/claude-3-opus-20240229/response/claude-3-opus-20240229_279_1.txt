Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few key details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may manifest more in technical rather than artistic pursuits
- His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits which could align with a technically demanding field like computer science

That said, this is based on limited information and stereotypes. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and computer science professors who like drawing and writing. More details about his specific research focus and expertise would help determine his field with greater confidence.

If I had to give a rough probability based solely on the description provided, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I would caution that this is a very tentative estimate from limited data that relies on stereotypes. Many more details would be needed to assign a probability with strong confidence.
