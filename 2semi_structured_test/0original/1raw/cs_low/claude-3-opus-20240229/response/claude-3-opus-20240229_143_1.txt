To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more closely related to the humanities.

However, we must be cautious about making stereotypical assumptions, as interests and personality traits can vary widely within both computer science and humanities professors.

Given the limited information and the need to avoid strong assumptions, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This probability reflects that while Jason's interests align more closely with computer science, there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. More information would be needed to make a more definitive judgment.
