Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer scientists.
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 
- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities.

That said, these are stereotypes and generalizations. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and plenty of computer scientists with artistic hobbies and large families.

Forced to give a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on stereotypes and the specific details provided. Much more information would be needed to give a confident assessment of the probability Jason is a computer science vs. humanities professor. The study methodology and findings would provide better aggregate insights than guessing based on any one profile.
