To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (the number of professors in each field) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of each field.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. The mentioned traits could apply to individuals in both fields, and there might be computer science professors who enjoy drawing or writing, as well as humanities professors who enjoy coding and puzzles.

Considering the base rates, there is a 25% (25/100) chance that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor, and a 75% (75/100) chance that they are a humanities professor.

Based on the description, I would estimate that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is somewhat higher than the base rate of 25%, but not overwhelmingly so, since the evidence is not conclusive.

{"probability": "0.6"}

This estimate suggests that while the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor, there is still a significant chance that he could be a
