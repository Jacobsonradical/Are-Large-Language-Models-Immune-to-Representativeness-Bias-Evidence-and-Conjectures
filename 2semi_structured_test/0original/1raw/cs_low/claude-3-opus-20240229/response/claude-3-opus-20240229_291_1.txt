Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

3. His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that seem well-suited for a demanding technical field like computer science.

4. No strong evidence is given to suggest he is more likely a humanities professor. His hobbies and personality align more closely with stereotypical traits of computer scientists.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, as the information given is not conclusive proof of his field. The description is also brief and could potentially fit some humanities professors. More details about his specific research focus and academic background would allow a more definitive assessment. But based solely on what is provided, I believe it is highly probable (85% chance) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
