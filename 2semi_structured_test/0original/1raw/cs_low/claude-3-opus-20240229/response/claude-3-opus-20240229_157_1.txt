Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that could align well with a rigorous and competitive field like computer science in academia.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description doesn't explicitly state his field, and some of the traits and interests could also apply to certain humanities professors. The sample also contains more humanities professors overall. But weighing the evidence, computer science seems more probable than not for Jason based on the description.
