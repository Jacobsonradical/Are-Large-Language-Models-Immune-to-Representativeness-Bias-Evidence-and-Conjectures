Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some key points:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- However, the other traits and hobbies mentioned (conservative, careful, ambitious, jogging, not enjoying drawing/writing) don't clearly point to either field.
- The base rates also matter - 75% of the sample are humanities professors. Without other distinguishing information, the base rates make any given individual more likely to be a humanities professor.

Weighing these factors, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 40%:

{"probability": "0.4"}

But there's a lot of uncertainty around this estimate given the limited information to distinguish the two groups in this particular description. More details about research focus, academic background, and other characteristics would allow for a more definitive estimate.
