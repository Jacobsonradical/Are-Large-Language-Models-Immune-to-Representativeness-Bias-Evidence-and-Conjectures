Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key details that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor are:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.
- His personality traits of being careful and ambitious align with stereotypes of computer scientists.

However, there's still a reasonable chance he could be a humanities professor who happens to have those traits and interests. The description doesn't provide definitively conclusive evidence either way. That's why I estimate a 75% probability rather than a near certainty.
