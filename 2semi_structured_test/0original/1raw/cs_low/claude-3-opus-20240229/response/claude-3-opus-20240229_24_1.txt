Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also seems more consistent with a computer science background

At the same time, other details like his family situation, personality traits, and jogging hobby don't clearly point to either field. Overall, if I had to estimate, I would say there is perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description. But this is highly uncertain given the limited information.
