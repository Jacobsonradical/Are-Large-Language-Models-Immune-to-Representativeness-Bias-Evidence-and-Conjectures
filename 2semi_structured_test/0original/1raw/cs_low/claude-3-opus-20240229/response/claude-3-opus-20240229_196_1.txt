To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to look for traits and interests that align more with computer science vs. humanities.

Traits and interests that suggest computer science:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. This strongly aligns with computer science.
- Described as "careful", which may fit an analytical field like computer science. 
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative. This suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical than artistic.

Traits and interests that are more neutral:
- Being married with children
- Jogging as a hobby
- Being described as conservative, talented and ambitious. These traits could apply to successful people in many fields.

Overall, Jason's profile contains some strong indicators of alignment with computer science (coding, math puzzles, technical creativity) and lacks clear markers of humanities focus.

Given that the overall sample has 25% computer science professors and 75% humanities professors, but Jason's individual traits point more to computer science, I estimate the probability he is a computer science professor as higher than the baseline 25% but not a certainty.
