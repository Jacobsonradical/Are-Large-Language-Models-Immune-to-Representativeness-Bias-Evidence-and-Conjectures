Based on the limited information provided, it's challenging to assign a definitive probability. However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, there seems to be a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Considering these factors, my estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.7"}

Please note that this is a subjective assessment based on the given description and the stereotypical traits often associated with computer science and humanities professors. More information about Jason's academic background, research interests, and publications would be needed to make a more accurate prediction.
