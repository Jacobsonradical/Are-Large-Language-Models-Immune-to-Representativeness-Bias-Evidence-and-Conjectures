Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or not. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment of creative writing and drawing may also point more toward a quantitative field like computer science.

However, these are only broad generalizations. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and not all computer science professors fit this mold. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But more data points about his specific academic background, research focus, and teaching areas would be needed to increase the confidence of that estimate. 

So in the requested format, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.65"}
