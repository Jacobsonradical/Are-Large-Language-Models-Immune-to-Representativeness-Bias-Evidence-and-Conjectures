To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more closely related to the humanities.
- The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Without more detailed statistical information about the distribution of these traits among the professors in the sample, we cannot calculate an exact probability. However, based on the limited information provided, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Considering the sample composition and Jason's interests, a reasonable estimate for the probability could be around 0.7 or 70%.
