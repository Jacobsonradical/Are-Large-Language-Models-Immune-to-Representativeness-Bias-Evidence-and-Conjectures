To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how the described characteristics align with the stereotypical traits of computer science vs humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

The base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description suggests that Jason has traits more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be higher than the base rate.
