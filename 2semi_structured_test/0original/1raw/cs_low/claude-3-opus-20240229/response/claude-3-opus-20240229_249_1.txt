Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors point to him being more likely a computer science professor (enjoying coding and math puzzles) while others are more ambiguous (being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to many successful professors).

Without more data on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups in this sample, I'll estimate the probability conservatively:

{"probability": "0.6"}
