To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details that may indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

Relevant details from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

While these details suggest a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, we should be cautious not to overweight them compared to the prior probabilities.

Considering the base rates and the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.6 to 0.7.
