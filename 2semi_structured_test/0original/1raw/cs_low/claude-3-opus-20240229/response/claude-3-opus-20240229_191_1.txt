Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, might indicate less interest in the humanities. 

- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities.

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile too. Conservative political views are found across academia. Many details like his marriage, children and jogging are not strongly indicative either way.

Without more specific information, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample to be:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But this is a tentative estimate based on limited data and stereotypical associations. More details about his specific research interests, academic background, and the relative gender balance between the two groups in the sample would allow for a more confident assessment.
