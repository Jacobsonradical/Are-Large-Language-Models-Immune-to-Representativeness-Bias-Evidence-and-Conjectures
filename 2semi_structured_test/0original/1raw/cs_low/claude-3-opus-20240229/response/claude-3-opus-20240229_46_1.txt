Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description doesn't rule out the possibility he's a humanities professor. Some humanities fields like linguistics involve logical puzzles. Many details like his family life seem largely irrelevant to determining his field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the given information, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this estimate has high uncertainty given the limited data.
