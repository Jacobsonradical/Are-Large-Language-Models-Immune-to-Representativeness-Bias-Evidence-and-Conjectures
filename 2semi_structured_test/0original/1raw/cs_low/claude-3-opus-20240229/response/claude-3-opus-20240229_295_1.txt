Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or not. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities more often associated with the humanities.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide Jason's actual field, and many of the other details (his age, marital status, values, jogging hobby) seem largely unrelated to his probability of being a CS professor.

Given the information pointing in both directions but leaning more towards computer science, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7, or 70%. But this is a very rough estimate given the limited information.
