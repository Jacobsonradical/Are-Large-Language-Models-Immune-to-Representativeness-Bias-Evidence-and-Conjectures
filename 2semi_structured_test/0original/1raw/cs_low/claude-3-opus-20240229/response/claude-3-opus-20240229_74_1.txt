To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the key characteristics and hobbies mentioned:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.
3. The description does not provide any strong evidence to suggest that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the limited information available and the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the assumption that the mentioned characteristics and hobbies are more strongly associated with computer science than with the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is a subjective estimate based on the given information, and more data would be needed to make a more accurate assessment.
