Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate more of a technical/analytical bent than a humanities focus.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Humanities professors can certainly also enjoy coding and math. And his other traits and demographics don't clearly indicate one field or the other.

Given the base rates in the sample (25% computer science, 75% humanities), and weighing the suggestive but inconclusive details, I'd estimate roughly a 60% probability Jason is a computer science professor.
