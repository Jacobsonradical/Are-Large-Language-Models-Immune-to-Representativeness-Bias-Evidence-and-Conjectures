Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, it's difficult to ascertain with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few clues suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science than humanities.

That said, these are only rough indicators based on generalized stereotypes. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and plenty of computer science professors who like writing and art. The other details provided like his age, marital status, political leanings and exercise habits seem largely unrelated to his field.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

That is, I believe there's roughly a 65% chance Jason is a computer science professor, with the acknowledgment that this estimate has a fairly high degree of uncertainty. More specific information about his research focus, publications, and academic background would be needed to assess his field with greater confidence.
