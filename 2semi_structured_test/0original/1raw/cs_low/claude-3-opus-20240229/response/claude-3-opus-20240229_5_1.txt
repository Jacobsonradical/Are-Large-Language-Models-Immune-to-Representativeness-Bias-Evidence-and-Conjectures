Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more common for computer science than humanities, where writing would be a key creative outlet

At the same time, the other details provided like his age, marital status, values and jogging hobby don't strongly indicate one field or the other.

So while far from certain, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor vs a humanities professor at around 0.6 or 60%. Here is my answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.6"}
