Based on the limited information provided in the description, it's difficult to conclusively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related fields.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide any definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Many of the other details, such as his age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits like being conservative, careful, and ambitious, could apply to professors in many fields.

Given the study's design with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. 

Weighing the base rate along with the suggestive but inconclusive details in Jason's description, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as moderately higher than the base rate, but not overwhelmingly so.
