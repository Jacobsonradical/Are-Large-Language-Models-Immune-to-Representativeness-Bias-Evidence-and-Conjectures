To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details that could indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Relevant details from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than humanities.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with humanities.

Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we should be cautious not to overweight the specific details and neglect the base rates.

Considering both the prior probability and the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.6 to 0.7.
