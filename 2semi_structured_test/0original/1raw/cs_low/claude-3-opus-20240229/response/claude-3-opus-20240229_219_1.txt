Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors suggest he could be a computer science professor, like enjoying coding and math puzzles. However, these traits don't necessarily mean he's a computer science professor, as some humanities professors may also have those interests. Likewise, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing doesn't clearly point to either field.

Without more specific information directly related to his academic field, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor in this sample is only slightly higher than chance:

{"probability": "0.6"}
