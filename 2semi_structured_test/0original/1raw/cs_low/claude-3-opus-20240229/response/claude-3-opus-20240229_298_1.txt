To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided in his description.

Key relevant facts:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being creative. This implies a lower probability of being a humanities professor.
- No other information clearly distinguishes him as more likely to be from one group or the other.

Given that the sample contains 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 25%. 

However, Jason's hobbies and preferences seem more aligned with a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as significantly higher than the base rate.

My educated guess would be:

{"probability": "0.7"}
