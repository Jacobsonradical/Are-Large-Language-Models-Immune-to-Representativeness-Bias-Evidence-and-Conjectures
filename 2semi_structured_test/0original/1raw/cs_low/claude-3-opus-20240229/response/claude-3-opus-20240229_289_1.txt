Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields.

- His hobbies of coding and math puzzles, along with not enjoying drawing or writing, suggest he may lean more towards analytical rather than artistic pursuits, which could point to computer science over humanities.

- Being described as "careful" and "ambitious" could align with stereotypes of computer scientists, though these traits are not exclusive to that field.

At the same time, the description provides no definitive information about Jason's profession. Plenty of non-computer scientists enjoy coding and math. Many humanities professors are also careful and ambitious. And with only 100 professors total across both disciplines, the 3:1 ratio of humanities to CS professors in the sample means that even if Jason "seems" more like a computer scientist, any given professor from the sample is still more likely to be a humanities professor, all else being equal.

Weighing these various factors, I'd estimate:

{"probability": "0.6"}

That Jason is a computer science professor, with the caveat that this probability is highly uncertain given the limited information provided. More details about his specific research focuses, publications
