Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate less affinity for the humanities. 
- Being described as "talented" in the context of other analytical traits and hobbies may imply talent in technical domains.

At the same time, the other traits and biographical details provided don't strongly indicate his academic field one way or the other. Ultimately, additional information would be needed to assign a probability with high confidence. 

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'll cautiously give a 60% probability of Jason being a computer science professor, while acknowledging the high uncertainty around this estimate:

{"probability": "0.6"}
