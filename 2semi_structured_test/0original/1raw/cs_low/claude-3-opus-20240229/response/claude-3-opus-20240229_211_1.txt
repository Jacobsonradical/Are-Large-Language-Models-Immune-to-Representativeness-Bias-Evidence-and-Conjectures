Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, common creative outlets more associated with the humanities.
- Computer science skews more male compared to the humanities.

That said, these are broad generalizations and there is certainly individual variation. Plenty of humanities professors are male, enjoy math and coding, and express creativity in ways other than writing/drawing. And the personality traits mentioned like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply across disciplines.

Without more information to go on, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.6, or 60%. But this is a tentative estimate based on limited data and stereotypical associations.
