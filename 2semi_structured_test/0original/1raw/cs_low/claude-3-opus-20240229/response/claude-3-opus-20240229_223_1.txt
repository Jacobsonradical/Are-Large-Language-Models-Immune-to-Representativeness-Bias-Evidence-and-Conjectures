Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science rather than humanities fields that often involve writing.

- Computer science professors are more heavily male-dominated compared to the humanities. As a man, this slightly increases the probability Jason is a computer science professor, all else being equal.

At the same time, the description provides no definitive information about Jason's field. Many details, like his family status, personality traits, and jogging hobby, don't clearly distinguish between the two fields.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate a 60% probability Jason is a computer science professor, but this is a tentative guess given the sparsity of field-specific information. So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
