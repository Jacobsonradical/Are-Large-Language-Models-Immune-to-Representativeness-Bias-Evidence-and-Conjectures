Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key pieces of information that suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, implying his creativity is more oriented towards technical pursuits. 

3. His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that could align with the rigor and drive often found in STEM fields.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 0.75 because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The sample also contained 3 times as many humanities professors as computer science professors, which I factored into my estimate.
