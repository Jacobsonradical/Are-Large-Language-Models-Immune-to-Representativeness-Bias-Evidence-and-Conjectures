Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could point in either direction:

Factors suggesting computer science:
- Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles, which are common interests for computer scientists
- Is described as careful and talented, traits that could suit a detail-oriented technical field

Factors suggesting humanities: 
- Has a large family, which may be more common in humanities than computer science
- Described as creative, a trait often associated with humanities fields
- Enjoys jogging, a non-technical hobby

Ultimately, the description doesn't provide enough distinctive information to make a strong judgment either way. Given that 25% of the sample are computer science professors, assigning a probability near that baseline of 25% seems reasonable without clearer evidence to weight it higher or lower.
