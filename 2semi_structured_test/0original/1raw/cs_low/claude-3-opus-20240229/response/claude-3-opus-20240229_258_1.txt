Based on the limited information provided, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, certain details in the description suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more commonly associated with computer science than humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative, seems more aligned with computer science than humanities, where writing would likely be an important skill

That said, these are stereotypical associations and there are certainly creative computer scientists who enjoy writing, as well as humanities professors who enjoy math and coding. The description doesn't provide strongly definitive evidence either way.

Without more specific information, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 60-70%. But this is a tentative assessment based on limited data prone to stereotypical assumptions.
