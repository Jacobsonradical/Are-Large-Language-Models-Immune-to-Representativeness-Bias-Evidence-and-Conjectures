To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rate (prior probability) and the specific details that may indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Without additional information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Relevant details from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than humanities.
- He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical and analytical creativity over artistic pursuits.

Considering the base rate and the description, there is a higher likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor compared to the prior probability. However, the description alone is not definitive proof, as there may be humanities professors with similar traits.

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability estimate is based on the limited information provided and assumes that the mentioned traits are more common among computer science professors. More data about the specific traits of professors in each field would be needed for a more accurate assessment.
