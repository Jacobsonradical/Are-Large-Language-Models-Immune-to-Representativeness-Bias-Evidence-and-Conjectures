Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, point towards computer science. However, other traits like being conservative, careful and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without knowing the base rates of these traits among the two professor groups or in the general population, I don't have enough information to calculate a precise probability. More data on the relative frequency of these characteristics in each group would be needed.

That said, if I had to give my subjective estimate based just on the description provided, I'd say the probability is slightly higher that Jason is a computer science professor, perhaps around 0.6. But this is a tentative guess with high uncertainty.
