Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science.

That said, none of these traits are exclusive to computer science, and many details like his family life and personality don't strongly indicate one field or the other. Without more information directly related to his academic discipline, the probability estimate can't be extremely high or low.

My rough estimate given the description would be:

{"probability": "0.65"}
