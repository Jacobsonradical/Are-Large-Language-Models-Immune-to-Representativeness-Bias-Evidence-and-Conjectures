Based on the given description, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. His personality traits of being careful, talented, and ambitious align with typical traits of successful academics, but seem especially compatible with computer science.

However, I didn't assign a probability of 1.0 because the description doesn't definitively rule out him being a humanities professor. The 0.8 probability reflects a high likelihood of him being a computer science professor based on the given information, while acknowledging some remaining uncertainty.
