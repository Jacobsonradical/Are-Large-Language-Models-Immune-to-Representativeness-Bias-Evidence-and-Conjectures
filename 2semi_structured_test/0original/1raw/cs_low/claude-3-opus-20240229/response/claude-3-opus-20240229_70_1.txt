Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more often associated with the humanities.

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and computer science professors who enjoy writing and art. More individual details about his specific research focuses, publications, teaching areas etc. would help inform the estimate.

If I had to give a rough probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But again, this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. Many more individual details would be needed to give a truly informed estimate.
