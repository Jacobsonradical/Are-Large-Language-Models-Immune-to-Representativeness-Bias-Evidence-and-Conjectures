To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of each group.

Given information:
- 25 professors are in computer science
- 75 professors are in the humanities
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities

Using this information, a reasonable estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The base rate alone would suggest a 0.25 probability (25/100). However, Jason's enjoyment of coding and math puzzles, coupled with his dislike for drawing and writing, strongly indicates he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, the probability is adjusted upward from the base rate.

It's important to note that this is an estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Individual traits and preferences can vary widely within both groups of professors.
