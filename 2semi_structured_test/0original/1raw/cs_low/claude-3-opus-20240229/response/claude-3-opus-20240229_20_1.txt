To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rate (the proportion of computer science professors in the sample) and how representative Jason's traits are of a stereotypical computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

Jason's enjoyment of coding and math puzzles, as well as his dislike for drawing and writing, suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we should be cautious not to overweight these stereotypical traits and underweight the base rate.

Considering both the base rate and the representativeness of Jason's traits, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be higher than the base rate but not overwhelmingly high.

{"probability": "0.6"}
