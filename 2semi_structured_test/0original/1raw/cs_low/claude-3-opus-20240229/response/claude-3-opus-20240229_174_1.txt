To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the traits and interests mentioned that align with typical computer science pursuits versus humanities pursuits.

Factors suggesting Jason is a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests for computer scientists.
- Described as talented and ambitious, traits that could apply to successful academics in either field.

Factors suggesting Jason is a humanities professor: 
- Enjoys jogging, a hobby that doesn't clearly align with either field.
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more typically associated with the humanities.

The description contains limited information to clearly differentiate between the two fields. The enjoyment of coding and math puzzles is the strongest indicator of being a computer science professor.

Given that only 25% of the sample are computer science professors, and without other strongly distinguishing characteristics, I estimate the probability to be only slightly higher than this base rate.
