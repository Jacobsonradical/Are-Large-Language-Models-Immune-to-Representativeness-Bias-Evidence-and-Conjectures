Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing and writing, while being ambitious and talented, aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. 

However, this is a tentative estimate based on very limited data and relies on generalizations. Much more information would be needed to make a truly confident assessment. The 3:1 ratio of humanities to computer science professors in the sample would also need to be factored in for a rigorous probability estimate using Bayes' theorem.
