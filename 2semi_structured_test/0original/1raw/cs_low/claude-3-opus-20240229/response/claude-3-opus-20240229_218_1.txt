Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points away from him being a humanities professor, as those activities are often integral to many humanities fields.

At the same time, the other personal details provided (his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby) seem largely unrelated to his field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

That is, I think there is around a 70% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. But more information would be needed to have strong confidence in this assessment.
