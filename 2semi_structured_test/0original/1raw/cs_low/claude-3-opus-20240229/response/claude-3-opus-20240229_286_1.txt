Based on the given description, here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2) His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests more of a technical/analytical creativity that aligns with computer science rather than the humanities. 

3) Being described as conservative, careful, talented and ambitious fits a common profile for computer science professors.

4) The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or pursuits.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 0.8 because the information is limited and does not definitively preclude the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. More details about his specific research focus and academic background would allow a more certain determination.
