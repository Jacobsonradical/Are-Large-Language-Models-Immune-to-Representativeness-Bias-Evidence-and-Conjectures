To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we can look for traits and interests that seem more likely to be associated with computer science versus the humanities.

Traits that suggest he may be a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests for computer scientists
- Described as careful and talented, traits that could align with the technical and detail-oriented nature of computer science

Traits that suggest he may be a humanities professor:
- Being married with five children at age 45 could align more with a traditional humanities background 
- Being described as conservative and not enjoying creative arts like drawing and writing seems to go against stereotypical traits of humanities professors

However, these are just rough stereotypes and associations, and there is far too little information to make a confident determination either way. The base rates (25% computer science, 75% humanities) also need to be factored in.

Given the limited information, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 40%. But this is highly uncertain.
