Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors pointing towards computer science are his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles. However, being conservative, careful, talented, ambitious and disliking creative arts could apply to many successful academics across fields. Without more distinguishing details, I'd estimate the probability at slightly higher than a coin flip that he's a computer science professor, but not with strong conviction:

{"probability": "0.60"}
