To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This suggests his creativity may be more focused on technical or analytical tasks.
3. The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Given that Jason's interests align more closely with computer science and the fact that there are fewer computer science professors in the sample, it is more likely that he is one of the 25 computer science professors.

However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate based on limited information, and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor with interests in coding and mathematical puzzles.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}
