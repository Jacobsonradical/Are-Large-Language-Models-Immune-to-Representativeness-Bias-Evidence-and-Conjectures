To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of each group.

Given information:
- 25 professors are in computer science
- 75 professors are in the humanities
- Base rate for computer science: 25/100 = 0.25
- Base rate for humanities: 75/100 = 0.75

Relevant traits for computer science:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing

Considering the base rates and the description, which seems to match the stereotypical traits of a computer science professor more closely than those of a humanities professor, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
