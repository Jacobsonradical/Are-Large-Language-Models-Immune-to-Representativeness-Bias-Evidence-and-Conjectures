To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This might suggest a preference for more technical and analytical creative outlets.
- The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Given the limited information, we can make an educated guess based on Jason's interests and the composition of the sample. Since coding and mathematical puzzles are more closely related to computer science than humanities, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate based on limited information, and there could be successful computer science or humanities professors with diverse interests and traits.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability indicates that while it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, there is still a 30% chance that he could be a humanities professor.
