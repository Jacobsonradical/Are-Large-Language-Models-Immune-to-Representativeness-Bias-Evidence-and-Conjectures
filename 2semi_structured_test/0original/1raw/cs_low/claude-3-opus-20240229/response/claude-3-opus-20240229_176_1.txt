Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to give a definitive probability. However, there are some clues in the description that suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more commonly found among humanities professors.

- His described personality traits of being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without more comparative data on the personality traits of the two groups, I'll make an educated guess that the probability Jason is a computer science professor is somewhat higher than the baseline 25% representation of CS professors in the overall sample.
