Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key pieces of information that led me to this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic, which aligns with computer science.

3. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or traits.

However, I did not give a probability estimate higher than 0.75 because the description is quite brief and does not provide definitive proof that Jason is a computer science professor. The enjoyment of coding and math puzzles is suggestive but not conclusive. More information about Jason's research focus, publications, teaching areas, etc. would allow for a more certain determination.
