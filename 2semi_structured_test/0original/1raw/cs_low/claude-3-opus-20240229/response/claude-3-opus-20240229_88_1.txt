Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing this high probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic. This fits the computer science profile better than humanities.

3. Traits like being careful and ambitious are fairly generic and could apply to successful academics in many fields.

Of course, this is just a probability estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Without more data on the actual distribution of these traits among the sample of professors, a definitive answer is not possible. But the clues in the description point more strongly to a computer science background for Jason.
