Based on the description provided, here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors leading to this high probability estimate are:

1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of an interest and talent in computer science.

2) His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that seem well-suited for a successful career in a highly technical field like computer science. 

3) While creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creative talents lie more in technical and analytical domains rather than artistic ones, again fitting the profile of a computer scientist.

4) Being 45, married with five children suggests an established, successful career, consistent with being a tenured professor.

The only factor that slightly reduces confidence is the 1:3 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample. Even accounting for that base rate, the description strongly points to Jason being much more likely to be one of the CS professors.
