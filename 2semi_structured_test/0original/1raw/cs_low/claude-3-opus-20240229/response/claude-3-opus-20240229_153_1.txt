Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to conclusively determine Jason's field. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative, point more towards a computer science background. At the same time, this is a generalization and there can certainly be humanities professors with those traits too. 

Given the need to provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1, I would say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This reflects my belief that while not certain, it seems more likely than not based on the description that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. But there is still a reasonable chance he could be in the humanities group.
