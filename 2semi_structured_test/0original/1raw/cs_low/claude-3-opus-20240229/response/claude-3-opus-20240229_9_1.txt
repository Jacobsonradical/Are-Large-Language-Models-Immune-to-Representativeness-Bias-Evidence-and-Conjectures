Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key traits that suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities fields. 

3. His personality is described as conservative, careful, and ambitious, which may align more with a technical/scientific mindset.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description provides limited information to conclusively determine his field. The 0.85 probability reflects a strong leaning towards computer science based on the available data points, while allowing for the possibility he could be a humanities professor with those particular traits and interests.
