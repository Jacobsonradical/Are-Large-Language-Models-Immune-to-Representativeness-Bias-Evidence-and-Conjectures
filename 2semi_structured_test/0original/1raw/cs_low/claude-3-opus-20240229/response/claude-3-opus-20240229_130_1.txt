To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rate (the proportion of CS professors in the sample) and how representative Jason's traits are of a typical CS professor versus a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The base rate of CS professors is 25/100 = 0.25.

Jason's traits that might be indicative of a CS professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing

Considering the limited information and the stereotypical traits mentioned, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a CS professor to be higher than the base rate, but not with very high confidence.

{"probability": "0.6"}

Note that this is a subjective estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. In reality, many more factors would contribute to determining an individual's field of expertise.
