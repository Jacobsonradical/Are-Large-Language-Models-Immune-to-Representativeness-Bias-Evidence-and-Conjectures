Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, could suggest a computer science background. However, other traits like being conservative, careful and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without knowing the base rates of these traits in the general population or among professors, I don't have enough information to give a precise probability estimate. A conservative, uncertain response is most appropriate given the ambiguous evidence.
