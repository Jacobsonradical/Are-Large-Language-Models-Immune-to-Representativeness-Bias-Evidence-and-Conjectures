Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields more so than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment of drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is more quantitative/analytical than artistic. 

- Computer science professors are a minority in the overall sample (25% vs 75% humanities), so in the absence of strong evidence, the base rates suggest someone is more likely to be a humanities professor.

Weighing these factors, I'd estimate there is a moderate probability Jason is a computer science professor, but significant uncertainty remains. As a rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.6"}
