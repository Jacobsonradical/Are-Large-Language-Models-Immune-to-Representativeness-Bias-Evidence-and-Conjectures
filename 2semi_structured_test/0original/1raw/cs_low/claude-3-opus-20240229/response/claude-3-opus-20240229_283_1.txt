Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles, seem to point towards computer science. However, those interests alone don't necessarily mean he's a computer science professor, as professors in quantitative fields within the humanities could share those hobbies. Other details, like being married with five children, seem largely irrelevant for distinguishing between the two categories.

Without more disambiguating information, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 60%, since his described interests align somewhat more with stereotypical computer science pursuits. But there's still substantial uncertainty.
