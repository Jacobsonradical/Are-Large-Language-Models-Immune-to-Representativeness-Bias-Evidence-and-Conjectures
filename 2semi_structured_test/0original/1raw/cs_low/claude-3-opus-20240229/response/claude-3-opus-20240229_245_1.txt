Based on the given description, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to assign a high probability are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. This fits the stereotypical profile of a computer scientist.

3. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or pursuits that would make it likely for Jason to be a humanities professor.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 0.8 because the information given is limited and there certainly could be some humanities professors who fit this general profile. The description is also consistent with other technical fields besides computer science. More details about Jason's specific research focus and academic background would allow for a more definitive estimate.
