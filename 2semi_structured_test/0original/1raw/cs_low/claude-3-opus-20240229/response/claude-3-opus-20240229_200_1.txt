Based on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without more detailed information on the specific personality traits that are more common among the computer science vs. humanities professors in the sample, I cannot give a definitive answer, so I am expressing my probability estimate as 0.75 rather than a value closer to 1.
