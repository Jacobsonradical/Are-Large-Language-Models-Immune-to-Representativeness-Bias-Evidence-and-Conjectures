Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits and interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities fields.

3. His other traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Of course, this is an educated guess based on limited information and stereotypical associations. There is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor with these traits and interests. More definitive information would be needed to assign a probability with higher confidence.
