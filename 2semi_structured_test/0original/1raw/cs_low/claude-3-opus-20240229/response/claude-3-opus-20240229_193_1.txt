Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate less interest in arts and humanities. 

- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities.

That said, these are generalizations and there is significant overlap in interests and demographics between the two groups. Many details, like his being married with children, are likely not strongly predictive either way.

Given the breakdown of the sample (25% computer science, 75% humanities), lacking other information I would estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.35"}

This estimate is higher than the baseline 25% to reflect the suggestive details above, but not drastically higher given how little we know. More details about his specific research focus, academic background, and personality traits would help refine the estimate.
