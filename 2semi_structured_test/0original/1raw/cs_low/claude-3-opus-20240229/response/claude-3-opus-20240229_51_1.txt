To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how his traits and interests align with typical computer science vs humanities professors.

Key information:
- 25% of the sample are computer science professors, 75% are humanities professors
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more with computer science
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more humanities-related creative pursuits

However, the description is quite limited to make a definitive assessment. Many of his other traits like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Given the base rates and Jason's strong alignment with computer science interests, I'd estimate the probability he is a computer science professor to be higher than the 25% base rate, but not overwhelmingly so due to limited information.

My estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
