Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly associated with computer science.

2. His enjoyment of jogging and not drawing or writing also seems more typical of someone in a technical field rather than the humanities. 

3. Being described as careful and talented could apply to either group, but combined with his specific interests, point more towards computer science.

4. Creativity is mentioned but applied more to technical pursuits rather than artistic ones.

However, there is still some uncertainty since the description doesn't explicitly state Jason's profession, and it's a relatively brief description to draw firm conclusions from. The 0.8 probability reflects a high likelihood of him being a computer science professor based on the available information, while allowing for the possibility it could be a humanities professor with some atypical traits and interests.
