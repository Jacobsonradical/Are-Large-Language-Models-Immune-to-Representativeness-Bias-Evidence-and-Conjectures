Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, certain details in the description suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professionals.

- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being highly creative could indicate his creativity is expressed more through technical or analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. 

- Computer science skews more male than humanities fields, so being male provides a small amount of probabilistic evidence toward computer science (though this is a much weaker signal than the hobby/interest info).

Without more data on the two groups to compare base rates and differentiating factors, I'll refrain from giving a specific numerical probability to avoid false precision. But considering the points above, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is moderately higher than him being a humanities professor, perhaps in the range of:

{"probability": "0.65"}
