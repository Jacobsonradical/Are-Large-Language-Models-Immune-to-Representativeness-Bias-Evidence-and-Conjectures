To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. The base rates suggest that there is a 25% chance (25 out of 100) that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor.

Considering the base rates and the description, which slightly favors the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, a reasonable estimate for the probability would be higher than the base rate of 25% but not extremely high.

{"probability": "0.6"}

This probability indicates that while the description suggests Jason might be a computer science professor, there is still a significant chance that he could be a humanities professor, given the limited information provided.
