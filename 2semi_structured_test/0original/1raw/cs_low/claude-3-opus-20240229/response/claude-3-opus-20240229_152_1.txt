Given the limited information provided, it's challenging to determine with high certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests align more closely with stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professionals.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly linked to computer science than humanities. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing might suggest a preference for more technical and analytical pursuits.

On the other hand, the description does not provide any information about Jason's specific research interests, publications, or academic background, which would be more reliable indicators of his field of expertise.

Considering the available information and making a cautious estimate, my probability assessment is:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This probability suggests that while there is a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor based on his interests and traits, there is still a significant chance that he could be a humanities professor, given the limited information provided.
