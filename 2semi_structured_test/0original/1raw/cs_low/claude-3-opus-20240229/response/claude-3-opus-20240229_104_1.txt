{"probability": "0.8"}

While the description provides some clues that could point to Jason being a computer science professor, such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as not enjoying drawing or writing, the information given is not definitive enough to say with certainty. Personality traits and hobbies have a wide distribution across fields.

However, given the specifics mentioned like coding and math, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities, I believe there is a reasonably high probability, around 0.8, that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. But we should be cautious about making overly confident judgments from limited personal details.
