To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the key information provided in the description that could indicate his field of study.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He is described as highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical creativity over artistic pursuits.

However, it's important to note that the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Some humanities professors may also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability is based on the assumption that enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, along with being creative in a non-artistic way, are more common traits among computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, without more definitive information, there is still a degree of uncertainty in this assessment.
