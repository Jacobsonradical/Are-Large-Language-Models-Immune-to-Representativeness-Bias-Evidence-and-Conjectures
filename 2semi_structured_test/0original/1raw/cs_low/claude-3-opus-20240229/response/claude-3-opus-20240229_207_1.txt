Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creative outlets may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic
- Computer science had a smaller sample size (25) compared to humanities (75), so the base rate probability of any randomly selected person being a CS professor is lower

That said, these are generalizations and there is substantial overlap in interests between fields. Many details, like his family life and personality traits, seem field-agnostic. 

Weighing the evidence, I'd estimate a 60% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this probability is not much better than a coin flip given the limited data.
