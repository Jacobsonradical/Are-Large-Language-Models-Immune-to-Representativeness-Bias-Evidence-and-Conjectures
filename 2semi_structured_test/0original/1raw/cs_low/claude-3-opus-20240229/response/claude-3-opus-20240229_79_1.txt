Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to conclusively determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common among humanities professors

At the same time, the description provides no information about Jason's specific areas of research, publications, or teaching, which would be more definitive indicators of his field.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate, and based solely on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This estimate suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor based on the personality description, but acknowledges substantial uncertainty given the limited information. More details about his specific academic background and focus would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
