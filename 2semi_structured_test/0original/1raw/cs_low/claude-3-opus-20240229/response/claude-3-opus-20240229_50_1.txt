Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative. This suggests his creativity manifests more in technical rather than artistic domains, again fitting the computer science stereotype.

3. Personality traits like being careful and ambitious are relatively generic and could apply to successful professors in many fields.

4. Other details like his age, marital status, and number of children seem largely irrelevant for distinguishing his field.

So while this is far from certain, the hobbies and creative outlets mentioned point relatively strongly to Jason being one of the 25 computer science professors in the sample, rather than one of the 75 humanities professors. But more information would be needed for a truly confident assessment.
