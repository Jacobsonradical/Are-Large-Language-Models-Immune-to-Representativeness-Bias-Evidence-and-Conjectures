Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, artistic pursuits that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description provides no definitive indication of his field, and many details (his age, marital status, values, jogging hobby) seem largely unrelated to distinguishing between the two fields.

Given the information provided, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 60-70%. But this is a tentative estimate based on very limited data.
