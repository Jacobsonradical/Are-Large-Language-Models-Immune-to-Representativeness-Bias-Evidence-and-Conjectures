Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science 

At the same time, the description doesn't rule out the possibility of him being a humanities professor. Humanities professors can also be conservative, careful, talented, ambitious and enjoy jogging.

Given the information provided, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.7, or 70%. But this is a rough estimate based on stereotypes and limited data. More details about his specific research area, publications, academic background etc. would allow for a more confident assessment.
