Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either category. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more typically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards technical rather than artistic pursuits

That said, this is far from definitive and relies on stereotypical assumptions. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy coding and math while not enjoying drawing. And the other details provided like his age, marital status, political leanings and jogging hobby seem largely unrelated to his field.

If I had to guess, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided. But that's a tentative estimate given the limited information. To express that in the requested format:
