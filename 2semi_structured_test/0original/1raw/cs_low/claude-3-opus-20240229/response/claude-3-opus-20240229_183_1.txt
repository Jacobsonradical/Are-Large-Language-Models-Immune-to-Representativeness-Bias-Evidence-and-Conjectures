Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to give a definitive probability. However, some key details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer scientists.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, is more typical of quantitative fields like computer science than humanities.

- Careful and ambitious personality traits are common in both fields, so those details are less informative.

Without more comparative data on the personality traits and interests of the two professor groups, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be moderately higher than him being a humanities professor, but not overwhelmingly so.
