Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more typically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could suggest more mathematically-oriented creative outlets

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of kids, and jogging hobby seem largely independent of academic field.

Without more definitive information to go on, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 70%:

{"probability": "0.7"}
