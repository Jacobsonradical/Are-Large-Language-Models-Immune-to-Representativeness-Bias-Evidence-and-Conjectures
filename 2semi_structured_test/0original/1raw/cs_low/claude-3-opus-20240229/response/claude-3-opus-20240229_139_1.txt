Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His hobbies don't include stereotypically humanities-related activities like drawing or writing.
- Computer science professors may be more likely to have larger families on average compared to humanities professors.

That said, these are generalizations and professors in any field can have a wide variety of personalities, hobbies and family situations. Humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding as well.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'll say there is a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this estimate has a high degree of uncertainty.
