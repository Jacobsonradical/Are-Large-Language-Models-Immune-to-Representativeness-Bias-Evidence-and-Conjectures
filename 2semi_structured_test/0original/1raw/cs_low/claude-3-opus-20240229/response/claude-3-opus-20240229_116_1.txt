Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors seem to point to computer science (his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles) while others are more ambiguous (being married with children, conservative, careful, ambitious, enjoying jogging). The fact he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing despite being creative could lean either way.

Without more data on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups, I'd estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor at only slightly higher than chance:

{"probability": "0.6"}
