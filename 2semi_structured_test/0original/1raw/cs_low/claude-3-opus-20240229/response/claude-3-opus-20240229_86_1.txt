Based on the limited information provided, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, certain details in the description suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors. 
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more characteristic of a computer science background rather than humanities.

At the same time, the description doesn't conclusively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the uncertainties, I would say there is a moderately higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor, based on the details provided. As a rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
