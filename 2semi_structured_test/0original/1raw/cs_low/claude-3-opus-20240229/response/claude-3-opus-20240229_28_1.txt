Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few things point to a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science than humanities.

That said, none of these traits are definitive. There are certainly humanities professors who code and enjoy math, and plenty of computer science professors who write and draw. Traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious are quite generic and could apply to successful professors in many fields.

So in summary, while the description hints Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor, there's still significant uncertainty given the limited information. I'd estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.65"}
