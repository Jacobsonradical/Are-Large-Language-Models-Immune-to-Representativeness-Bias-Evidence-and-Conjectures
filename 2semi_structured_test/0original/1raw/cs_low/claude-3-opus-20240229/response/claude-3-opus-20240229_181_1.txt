Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details stand out that suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science and STEM fields. 

- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities which may be more common among humanities professors.

- His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits which could align with a rigorous technical field like computer science.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide Jason's specific area of expertise or research interests, which would be the strongest indicators. Conservatism and having a large family also don't necessarily correlate with academic field.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 70% or 0.7. But much more detailed information about his work and background would be needed to improve the confidence of this estimate.
