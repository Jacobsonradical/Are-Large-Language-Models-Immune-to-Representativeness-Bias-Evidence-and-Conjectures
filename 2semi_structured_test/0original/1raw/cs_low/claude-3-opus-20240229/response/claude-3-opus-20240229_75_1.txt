Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing, while also being ambitious, suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without more specific information it's impossible to say definitively. The 0.8 probability reflects a reasonably high level of confidence based on the description, while still allowing for some uncertainty.
