Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than humanities 
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could point more towards technical/analytical creativity rather than artistic
- Being ambitious and conservative are traits that could align with a competitive STEM field

That said, these are generalizations and there is significant overlap in traits between fields. Many details like his family situation seem unrelated to field. Overall, I'd estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This is a tentative probability based on the information given, acknowledging significant uncertainty. More details about his specific research focus, academic background, and personality would help refine the estimate. But the description paints a picture that aligns somewhat more with stereotypical traits of computer science professors.
