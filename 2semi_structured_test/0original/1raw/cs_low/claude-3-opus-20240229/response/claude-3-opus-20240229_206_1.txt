Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to give a definitive probability. However, there are a few clues that suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more associated with computer science than humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities more common among humanities professors.

That said, these are stereotypical associations and certainly many humanities professors also enjoy logic puzzles and many computer scientists draw and write. His other traits like being married with children, conservative, careful, and ambitious could apply to professors of any discipline.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be modestly higher than him being a humanities professor, but not overwhelmingly so. My rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.6"}
