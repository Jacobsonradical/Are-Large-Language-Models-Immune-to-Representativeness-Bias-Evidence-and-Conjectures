Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are often associated with computer science, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are more often associated with the humanities, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This is a rough estimate based on the personality traits and interests described. It's important to note that individual personalities and interests can vary widely within any field, so this probability should be taken as a tentative guess rather than a definitive answer.
