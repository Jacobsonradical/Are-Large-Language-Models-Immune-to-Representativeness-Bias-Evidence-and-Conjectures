Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities

At the same time, the description provides no information about his specific research interests, publications, or academic background that would allow a more definitive determination.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1 based on the available information, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This estimate leans towards him more likely being a computer science professor given his stated interests, but still allows a significant 35% chance that he could be a humanities professor, since the description is quite limited. More details about his specific academic work would be needed to assign a higher probability to one field or the other with strong confidence.
