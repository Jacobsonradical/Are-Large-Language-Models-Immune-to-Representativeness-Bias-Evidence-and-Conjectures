Based on the limited information provided, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

- Computer science tends to skew more male than the humanities, so being male provides a small amount of additional probability he is a CS professor, all else being equal.

However, none of these factors are conclusive on their own, and many of the other details provided (his age, marital status, children, personality traits) seem fairly neutral between the two categories. More data would be needed to make a confident assessment.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I would caution that this is a very rough estimate with considerable uncertainty given the limited information. More details about his specific research focus, education, and other academic background would allow for a more precise estimate.
