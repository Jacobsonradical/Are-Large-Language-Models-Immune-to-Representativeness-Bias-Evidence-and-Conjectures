To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information and how strongly it indicates he belongs to one group or the other.

Relevant details suggesting he could be a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.
- Is described as highly creative, a trait that can be beneficial in computer science.

Relevant details suggesting he might not be a computer science professor:
- Enjoys jogging, which is not particularly indicative of either group.
- The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests.

The description lacks information strongly distinguishing computer science from humanities professors. Both groups could plausibly enjoy math puzzles and coding as hobbies. The prior probability he is a computer science professor is 25%, based on the study's sample.

Considering the above, I believe the probability is slightly higher than the prior probability, but not substantially higher due to the limited information. My estimate is:

{"probability": "0.35"}
