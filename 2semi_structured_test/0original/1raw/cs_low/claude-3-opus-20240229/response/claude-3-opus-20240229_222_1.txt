Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either profile. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than humanities
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more common for quantitative fields than humanities which often involve writing

On the other hand, the description doesn't provide strong differentiating information. Many details like his age, marital status, values, and jogging hobby don't clearly distinguish between the two professor groups.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this estimate has high uncertainty.
