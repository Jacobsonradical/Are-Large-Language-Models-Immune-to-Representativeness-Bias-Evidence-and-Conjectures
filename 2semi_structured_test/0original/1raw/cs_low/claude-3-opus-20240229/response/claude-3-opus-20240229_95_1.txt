To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information in his description that aligns with traits and interests that may be more common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Relevant points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities closely related to computer science.
2. He is described as highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more oriented towards technical or analytical pursuits.

However, we should be cautious about making strong assumptions based on limited information and stereotypes. The description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given the information provided and the need to make a reasonable estimate while acknowledging uncertainty, I would assign the following probability:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This estimate suggests a higher likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on his interests and traits, but it also acknowledges the possibility that he could be a humanities professor or that the given information may not be entirely predictive of his field.
