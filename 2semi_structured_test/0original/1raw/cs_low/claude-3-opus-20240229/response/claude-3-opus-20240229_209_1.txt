To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the relevant information provided and apply Bayesian reasoning.

Given:
- The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities more commonly associated with the humanities.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Let P(CS) be the probability of being a computer science professor, and P(H) be the probability of being a humanities professor.
Let P(J|CS) be the probability of having Jason's characteristics given that he is a computer science professor, and P(J|H) be the probability of having Jason's characteristics given that he is a humanities professor.

P(CS|J) = P(J|CS) * P(CS) / [P(J|CS) * P(CS) + P(J|H) * P(H)]

We know that P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 and P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75.

While we don't have exact values for P(J|CS) and P(J|H), we can make an educated guess based on the description. Jason's
