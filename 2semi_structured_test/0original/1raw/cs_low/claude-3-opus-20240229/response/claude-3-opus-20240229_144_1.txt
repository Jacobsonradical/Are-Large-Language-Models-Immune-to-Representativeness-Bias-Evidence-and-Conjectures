Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could point more towards technical rather than artistic creativity

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem largely unrelated to his field.

Given the need to provide a specific probability estimate between 0 and 1 based on this single description, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information and stereotypical associations. Many more details would be needed to make a truly informed estimate of the probability. The actual base rates of computer science vs. humanities professors in the study sample (25% vs 75%) would also be relevant prior probabilities to consider.
