Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could point more toward technical/analytical creativity over artistic/writing creativity

At the same time, the other personality traits and biographical details provided don't clearly indicate one field over the other. Conservatism, carefulness, talent, ambition and enjoying jogging seem like they could be equally prevalent in both groups.

So while the description hints Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor, there's still substantial uncertainty given the limited information. As a rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
