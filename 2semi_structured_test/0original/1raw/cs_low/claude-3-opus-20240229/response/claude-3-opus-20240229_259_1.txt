To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rate (prior probability) and the specific details that may indicate his field.

Prior probability:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- P(computer science) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

Relevant details:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests he might be a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence to significantly deviate from the base rate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be slightly higher than the prior probability of 0.25, but not significantly higher.
