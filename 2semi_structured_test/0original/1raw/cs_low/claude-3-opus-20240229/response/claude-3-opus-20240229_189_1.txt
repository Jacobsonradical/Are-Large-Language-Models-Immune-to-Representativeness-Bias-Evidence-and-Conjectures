To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to look for traits and interests that are more likely associated with computer science compared to the humanities.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely related to computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.

However, other information like his age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious) do not provide a clear indication of his field.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Considering Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be higher than the prior probability.
