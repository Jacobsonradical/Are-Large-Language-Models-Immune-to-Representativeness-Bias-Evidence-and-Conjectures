Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key pieces of information that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1) He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2) Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical/analytical in nature. 

3) His personality is described as conservative, careful and ambitious, traits that could align with a detail-oriented technical field.

However, I can't be certain based on this limited information. The description doesn't definitively identify his field. And of course, not all computer science professors fit this profile and some humanities professors may have similar traits and interests. But if I had to estimate a probability based solely on what's provided, I'd say there's about a 75% chance Jason is one of the CS professors in the sample.
