Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His dislike of drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he may be more analytically than artistically inclined. 

3. Careful, conservative, and ambitious personality traits could apply to either group, but may be somewhat more common in STEM fields.

However, there are many unknowns and individual variations, so my probability estimate is far from certain. More comprehensive data about the relative frequency of these traits in the two groups would be needed for a highly confident assessment.
