To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we should consider the traits and interests that may be more associated with computer science versus the humanities.

Relevant points:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.
- He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative. This could suggest his creativity is more oriented towards technical fields rather than artistic expression, which may be more common in the humanities.

However, the description is quite brief and does not provide definitive evidence either way. Many of the other traits like being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, as well as enjoying jogging, could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Given the limited information, a reasonable estimate is that there's a somewhat higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor, but not overwhelmingly so.
