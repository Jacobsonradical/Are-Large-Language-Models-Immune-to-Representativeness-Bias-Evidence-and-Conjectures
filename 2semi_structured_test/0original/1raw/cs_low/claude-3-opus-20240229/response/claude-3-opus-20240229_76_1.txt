Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors like his enjoyment of coding and solving math puzzles point towards computer science. However, other details like having a large family and enjoying jogging don't clearly indicate his field. Without more information directly related to his academic specialization, I'll estimate the probability conservatively:

{"probability": "0.6"}
