To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than humanities.
- He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This suggests his creativity is more aligned with technical and analytical fields like computer science.
- Other details like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby are likely not strongly indicative of his field of study.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

However, the description of Jason's interests and skills suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor. While not conclusive, the evidence points more towards computer science than humanities.

Considering the prior probability and the additional information, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.7 or 70%.
