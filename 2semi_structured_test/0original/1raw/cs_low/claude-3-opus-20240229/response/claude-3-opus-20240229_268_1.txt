Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, a few details suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His disinterest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science rather than humanities fields that often involve those activities.

At the same time, the description provides no information about his specific academic role, research focus, or other factors that could more clearly identify his field.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I'll say there is a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But I want to emphasize this is a tentative estimate based on stereotypes and very limited data.

{"probability": "0.7"}
