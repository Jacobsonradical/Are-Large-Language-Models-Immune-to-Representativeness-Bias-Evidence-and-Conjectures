To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the relevant information:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.
- The sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Without additional information about the distribution of these traits among the two groups, we can make an educated guess based on the description.

Given that Jason's interests align more closely with computer science and the sample contains 25% computer science professors, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor would be higher than the baseline of 25%, but not extremely high, as we don't have definitive information.

{"probability": "0.6"}

This estimate suggests that there is a 60% chance that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the limited information provided in the description and the composition of the sample.
