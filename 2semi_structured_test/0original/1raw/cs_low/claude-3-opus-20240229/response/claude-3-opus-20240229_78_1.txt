To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the traits and interests that might be more associated with computer science versus the humanities.

Relevant information:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities

However, the description is quite brief and does not provide a lot of distinguishing information. Many of the other details like age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to professors in either field.

Given the limited information that specifically points to computer science, but also acknowledging the small sample size of computer science professors (25) compared to humanities professors (75), I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.6"}

This probability reflects that there is some evidence pointing towards computer science, but a significant amount of uncertainty remains due to the brevity of the description and the unequal sample sizes. More distinguishing details would be needed to make a more definitive judgment.
