Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

- Computer science professors may be somewhat more likely to be male compared to humanities professors, though this varies by subfield.

Without more data on the two groups to compare base rates and other factors, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 60-70% based on the description. 

So my probability estimate is:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat this is a tentative estimate from limited data. More details on Jason and the two professor populations would allow for a more definitive probability.
