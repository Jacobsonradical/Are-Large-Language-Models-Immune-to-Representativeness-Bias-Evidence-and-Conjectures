Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Some factors in his description could point either way:

Factors suggesting he may be a CS professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among CS professors
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more typically associated with humanities

Factors that don't clearly indicate his field:
- Being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious 
- Enjoying jogging
- His age, marital status, and number of children

Without more definitive information about his research focus, publications, teaching topics etc., I don't feel I can give a probability much higher or lower than 50%. So my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.55"}

But this probability is highly uncertain given the limited information to base it on. More details about Jason's specific academic work and intellectual pursuits would be needed to estimate the probability with greater confidence.
