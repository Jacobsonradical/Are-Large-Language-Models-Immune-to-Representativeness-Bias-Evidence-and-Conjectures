Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities
- Computer science skews more male compared to the humanities

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile and computer science professors who don't.

If I had to give a rough probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. Many more details about Jason's background, research focus, and personality would be needed to give a truly informed estimate. The study methodology of comparing only 25 CS professors to 75 humanities professors also skews the base rates.
