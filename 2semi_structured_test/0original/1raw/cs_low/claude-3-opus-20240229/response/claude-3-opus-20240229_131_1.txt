Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors like his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles point towards computer science. However, other details like being married with five children don't strongly indicate either field.

Without more data on how the traits and hobbies mentioned correlate with the two academic disciplines in the study population, I'll estimate the probability conservatively:

{"probability": "0.6"}
