Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, certain details in the description suggest Jason may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns with typical interests of computer scientists
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, implying his creativity manifests more in technical/analytical domains than artistic ones
- Focus on his marital status, children and hobbies without mentioning any humanities-related interests 

At the same time, the description does not rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor, as the details provided are quite general. More specific information about his research focus and academic background would be needed to make a more confident determination.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I would subjectively assess the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This estimate leans towards him being a computer science professor based on the suggestive details, while acknowledging substantial uncertainty remains. The probability would need to be revised significantly in either direction if more specific academic details about Jason were provided.
