Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to ascertain with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem more typically associated with computer science and STEM fields. Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles in particular seem to point in that direction, while not enjoying drawing or writing could suggest less affinity for the humanities. At the same time, these are stereotypes and individual traits that may not be strongly predictive of his actual field.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the uncertainty, I'd say there's perhaps a 65% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided. But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate given the limited data points to work from.
