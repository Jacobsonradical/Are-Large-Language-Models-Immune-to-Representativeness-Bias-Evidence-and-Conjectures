Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more humanities-oriented creative pursuits.

At the same time, having a large family and enjoying jogging don't necessarily point to either field. And of course, there are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and computer science professors who enjoy writing and drawing. Personality and interests don't always neatly align with professional field.

If I had to estimate a probability based just on this short description, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But there's still a decent chance he could be a humanities professor.
