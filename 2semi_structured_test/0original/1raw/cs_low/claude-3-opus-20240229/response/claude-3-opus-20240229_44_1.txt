Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. This fits the typical profile of a computer scientist better than a humanities professor.

3. Traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields. But combined with his specific interests, they further point to a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypical associations. There's still a reasonable chance Jason could be a humanities professor who defies the typical profile. But if I had to guess based solely on this description, an 80% probability of him being a computer science professor seems appropriate.
