Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may point more towards technical and analytical creativerather than artistic creative pursuits common in the humanities.

- Being described as "careful" and "ambitious" may fit more with stereotypes of STEM academics.

That said, these are very broad generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile and CS professors who don't. Family status and hobbies like jogging also seem minimally relevant. 

In the absence of more definitive information, I'll estimate the probability of Jason being a CS professor as slightly higher than an even 50/50 split, but not with strong confidence:

{"probability": "0.6"}
