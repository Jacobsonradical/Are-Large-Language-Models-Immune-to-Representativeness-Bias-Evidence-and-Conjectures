To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more closely related to humanities.

However, we should also keep in mind that the sample sizes for computer science and humanities professors are different:

- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Without more specific information about the distribution of personality traits and interests among the two groups, we can make an educated guess based on the activities Jason enjoys and the sample sizes.

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability reflects the fact that Jason's interests align more closely with computer science, but also takes into account the larger sample size of humanities professors, which introduces some uncertainty.
