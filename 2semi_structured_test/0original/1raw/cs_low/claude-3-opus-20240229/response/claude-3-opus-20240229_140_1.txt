Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either category. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His dislike of drawing and writing despite being creative runs a bit counter to typical humanities interests

That said, these are only slight probabilistic hints based on stereotypes. Plenty of computer science professors have large families, and many humanities professors enjoy math and don't love drawing. There's not enough strongly distinguishing information here to assign an extreme probability either way.

If I had to guess, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-65% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description. But I wouldn't be at all surprised to be wrong. I'll split the difference and say:

{"probability": "0.625"}
