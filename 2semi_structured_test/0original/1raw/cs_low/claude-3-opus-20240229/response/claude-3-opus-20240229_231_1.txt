Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could also point more towards computer science rather than humanities.

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby don't strongly indicate one field over the other.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

This reflects that the description leans towards computer science based on the hobby information, but not overwhelmingly so given the limited data. There's still a reasonable chance he could be a humanities professor.
