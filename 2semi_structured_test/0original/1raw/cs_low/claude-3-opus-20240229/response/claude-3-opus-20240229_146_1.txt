To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, we should be cautious about making strong assumptions based on stereotypes. The description does not provide definitive evidence of Jason's field of study.

Given the limited information, a reasonable estimate would be that there is a slightly higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

{"probability": "0.6"}

This probability reflects a slight inclination towards computer science based on Jason's interests, but it also acknowledges the uncertainty due to the lack of conclusive evidence in the description.
