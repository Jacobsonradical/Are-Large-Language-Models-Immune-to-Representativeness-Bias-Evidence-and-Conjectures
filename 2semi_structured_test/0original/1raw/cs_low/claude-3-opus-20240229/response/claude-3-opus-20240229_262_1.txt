Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to ascertain with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science 

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, values and jogging hobby seem fairly generic and don't strongly indicate his field one way or the other.

So while far from certain, I'd estimate a moderately higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor, perhaps around 70%:

{"probability": "0.7"}
