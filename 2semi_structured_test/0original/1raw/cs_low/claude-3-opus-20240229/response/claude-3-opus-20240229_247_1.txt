Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, seem to point towards computer science. However, other traits like being conservative, careful and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without more specific information comparing the typical traits of the two groups, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at only slightly higher than chance:

{"probability": "0.6"}
