Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to ascertain with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles point towards computer science, while others like being married with five children don't necessarily indicate his field.

Without more definitive information, I'd estimate the probability at slightly higher than a coin flip that he's a computer science professor, since the description includes a couple relevant hints in that direction. But there's still substantial uncertainty.
