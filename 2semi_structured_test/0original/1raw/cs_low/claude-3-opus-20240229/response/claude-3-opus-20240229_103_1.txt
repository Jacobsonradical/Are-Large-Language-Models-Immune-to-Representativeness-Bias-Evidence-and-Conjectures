Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate less affinity for the humanities. 

- Being ambitious and talented are traits that could apply to successful professors in any field.

Without more data on the personality trait distributions between the two groups, I'll estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as slightly higher than chance, but not with high confidence:

{"probability": "0.6"}
