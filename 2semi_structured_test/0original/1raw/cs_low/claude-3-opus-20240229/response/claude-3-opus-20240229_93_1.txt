Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related technical fields. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide any definitive evidence that he is a computer science professor. Academics in many fields may enjoy coding and math puzzles. And not all humanities professors necessarily enjoy creative writing or art.

Given the very limited information to go on, I'll estimate the probability cautiously at 60% that Jason is a computer science professor, while acknowledging significant uncertainty. Here is my answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.6"}
