To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description.

Relevant information:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being highly creative. This might suggest a preference for more technical or analytical creative outlets.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as there could be humanities professors with similar traits and interests.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This probability is based on the assumption that enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, combined with a lack of interest in drawing and writing, are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. However, without more specific information about Jason's academic background and research interests, there is still some uncertainty.
