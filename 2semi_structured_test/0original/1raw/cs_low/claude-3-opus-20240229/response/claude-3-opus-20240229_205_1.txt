Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some details, like his enjoyment of coding and math puzzles, might suggest a higher likelihood of being a computer science professor. However, traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without more specific information comparing the typical traits of computer science vs humanities professors in the sample, I'd estimate the probability at close to a coin flip, perhaps slightly favoring computer science.
