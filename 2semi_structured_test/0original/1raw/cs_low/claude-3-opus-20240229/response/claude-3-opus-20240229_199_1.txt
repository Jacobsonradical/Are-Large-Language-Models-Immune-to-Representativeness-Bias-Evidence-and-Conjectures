Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a highly confident determination. However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, coupled with his disinterest in drawing and writing which are more associated with the humanities, I would estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor to be higher than that of him being a humanities professor. 

My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to emphasize this is a tentative probability assessment based on stereotypical associations and very limited data. Much more information about Jason's specific research focus, publication record, teaching subjects and other factors would be needed to make a truly informed estimate.
