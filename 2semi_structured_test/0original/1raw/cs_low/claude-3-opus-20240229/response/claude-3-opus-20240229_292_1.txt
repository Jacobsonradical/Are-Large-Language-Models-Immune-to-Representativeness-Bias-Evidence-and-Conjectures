Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

That said, these are far from conclusive indicators, and plenty of humanities professors also enjoy logic puzzles and are not artistically inclined. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could easily apply to successful professors in either field.

Given the description focuses more on personality than clear professional indicators, and acknowledging the small sample size, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at:

{"probability": "0.6"}
