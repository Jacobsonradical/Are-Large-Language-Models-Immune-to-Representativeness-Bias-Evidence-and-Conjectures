Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Some of his traits and interests, like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, are more stereotypically associated with computer science. However, these interests are not exclusive to computer scientists, and humanities professors can certainly share these traits too.

Without more contextual information about the relative proportion of these traits in the two groups of professors in the study, I don't feel I can give a probability estimate that is much different from the baseline proportion of CS professors in the sample (25%).

So my estimated probability would be:

{"probability": "0.3"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. More data about the actual distinguishing traits of the two groups would be needed to give a confident and rigorous probability estimate.
