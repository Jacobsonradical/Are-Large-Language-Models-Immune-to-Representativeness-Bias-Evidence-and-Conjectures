Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors point to him being more likely a computer science professor, such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, other details like being married with five children and enjoying jogging don't clearly distinguish between the two fields.

Without more specific information comparing the relative proportions of these traits between the computer science and humanities professors in the sample, I'll estimate the probability conservatively.

{"probability": "0.6"}
