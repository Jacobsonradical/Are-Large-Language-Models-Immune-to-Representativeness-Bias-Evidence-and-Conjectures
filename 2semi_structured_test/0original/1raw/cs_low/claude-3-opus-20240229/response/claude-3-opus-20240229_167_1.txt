Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors pointing to him being a computer science professor are:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists
- His personality is described as careful and ambitious, which could fit the analytical mindset of many computer scientists 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, might suggest more technical than artistic creative outlets

However, these are fairly weak indicators and rely heavily on stereotypes. Many humanities professors are also highly analytical, enjoy puzzles, and are not artistically inclined. Conversely, some computer science professors do have strong writing and artistic skills.

Given that the original sample contained 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the base rate probability that any randomly selected description would be a computer science professor is 25%. 

Considering the description leans slightly towards computer science stereotypes but is still highly ambiguous, I'll adjust this base rate up a bit to 40%.

So in summary:

{"probability": "0.40"}
