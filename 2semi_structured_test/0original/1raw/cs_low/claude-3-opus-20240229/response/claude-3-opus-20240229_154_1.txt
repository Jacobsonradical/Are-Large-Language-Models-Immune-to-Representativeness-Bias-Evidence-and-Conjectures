To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the key information provided:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests he may be a computer science professor.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities professors.
3. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as some of his other characteristics could be found in both groups.

Given the limited information and the fact that the sample includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, a reasonable estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.6"}

This probability is slightly higher than the base rate of 0.25 (25 out of 100 professors are in computer science) because Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles are more strongly associated with computer science. However, the probability is not extremely high, as the description does not provide conclusive evidence of his field.
