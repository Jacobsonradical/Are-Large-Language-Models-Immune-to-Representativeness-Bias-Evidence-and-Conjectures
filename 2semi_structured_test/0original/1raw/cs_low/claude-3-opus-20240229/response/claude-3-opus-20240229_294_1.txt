Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, hints that his creativity may manifest more in technical rather than artistic pursuits. 

- Computer science skews more heavily male compared to the humanities.

That said, these are generalizations and Jason certainly could be a humanities professor who happens to enjoy math and coding. More definitive clues like his specific research focus are absent.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate given the limited information.
