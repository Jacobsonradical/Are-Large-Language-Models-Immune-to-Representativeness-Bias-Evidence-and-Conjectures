Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of enjoyment of drawing and writing, despite being creative, may point away from humanities. 

- Computer science skews more male than humanities, so him being male provides a small signal toward CS.

That said, these are broad generalizations and Jason certainly could be a humanities professor who happens to personally enjoy math and coding. Many details like his family status and personality traits seem fairly neutral between the two fields.

If I had to estimate a probability based on this description alone, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But this estimate has high uncertainty given the limited information. More details about his specific research focus, educational background, methodologies used, etc. would help refine the estimate.
