To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the traits and interests that align with being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide a definitive answer, as there could be exceptions in both fields. Some additional information that could help make a more accurate assessment include Jason's educational background, research focus, and publications.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the assumption that enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing and writing, makes it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, without more definitive information, there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
