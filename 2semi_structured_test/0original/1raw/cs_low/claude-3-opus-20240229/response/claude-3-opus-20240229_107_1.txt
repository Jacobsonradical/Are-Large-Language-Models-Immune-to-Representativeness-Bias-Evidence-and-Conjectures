Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is expressed more through technical or analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones.

- Computer science skews more male than the humanities, so the fact Jason is male provides a small amount of additional probability he is a computer science professor.

However, these are generalizations and there is not enough information to make a confident determination. Many humanities professors may also enjoy coding and math while disliking writing. The personality traits listed are quite generic and could describe many academics across fields.

If I had to estimate a probability based on this description alone, I would say:

{"probability": "0.6"}

But I want to emphasize this probability is highly uncertain given the limited information. More details about his research focus, publications, and academic background would be needed to make a truly informed estimate.
