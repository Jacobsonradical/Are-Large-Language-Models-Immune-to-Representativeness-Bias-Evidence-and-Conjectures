Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key details that suggest Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

3. The description does not mention any strong humanities-related interests or traits that would be more common among humanities professors.

Of course, this is still just an educated guess based on limited information and stereotypes. Not all computer science professors will fit this mold, and some humanities professors could have a profile like Jason's. But given the details provided, I believe there is a high probability (around 80%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
