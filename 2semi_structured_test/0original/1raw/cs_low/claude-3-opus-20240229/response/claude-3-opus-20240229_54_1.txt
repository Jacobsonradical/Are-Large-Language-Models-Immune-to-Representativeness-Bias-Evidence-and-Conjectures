Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities more often associated with the humanities.

At the same time, other details like his marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem largely unrelated to his field. And of course, there are many exceptions to stereotypical characteristics of different professions.

Given the information provided, I would estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be slightly higher than chance, perhaps around 60%:

{"probability": "0.6"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited data and relying on generalizations. Many more details about Jason's background, research focus, and personality would be needed to make a truly informed estimate. The best answer is that there is still significant uncertainty given the information provided.
