Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some aspects of his description could fit either field. However, a few clues suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer scientists 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may manifest more in technical rather than artistic pursuits
- Computer science skews more male than humanities, so being male provides a small amount of additional probability 

That said, these are far from definitive signals and there are certainly humanities professors who share some of these traits. Overall, if I had to estimate a probability based on this description, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But this estimate comes with high uncertainty given the limited information to distinguish the two categories. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, department, or other academic background would help refine the estimate.
