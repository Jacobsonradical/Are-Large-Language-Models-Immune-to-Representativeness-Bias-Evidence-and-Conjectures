Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors. 
- His lack of interest in creative arts like drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, may point more towards technical creative outlets common in computer science.
- Computer science skews more male compared to the humanities, so his gender is suggestive but only weakly.

On the other hand, the description does not provide Jason's specific research focus, publications, or other clear markers of his field. Many of the other traits mentioned, like being careful and ambitious, are quite generic. And of course there is individual variation in any field.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor to be around 65%. But this is a tentative assessment given the sparsity of field-specific information.
