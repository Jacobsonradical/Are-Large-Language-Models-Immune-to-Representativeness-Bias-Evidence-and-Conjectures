To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the key characteristics and hobbies that align with the stereotypical traits of computer science professors.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.
- He is described as talented and ambitious, traits that could be applicable to successful academics in both computer science and humanities.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more associated with humanities professors.

However, it's important to note that these are stereotypical associations and may not always hold true for individuals. The description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given the limited information and the need to avoid strong assumptions, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.6"}

This probability indicates that while there is a slight inclination towards Jason being a computer science professor based on his hobbies and lack of interest in drawing and writing, there is still a significant chance that he could be a humanities professor. More information would be needed to make a more definitive assessment.
