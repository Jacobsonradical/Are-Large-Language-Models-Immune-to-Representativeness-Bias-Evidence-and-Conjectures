To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in the description and see how well it aligns with typical characteristics of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as there could be some overlap in interests between the two groups.

Given the limited information, a reasonable estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This estimate suggests that there is a higher likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on his interests, but it is not a certainty due to the potential for overlap between the two groups and the lack of more specific information about his academic background and research areas.
