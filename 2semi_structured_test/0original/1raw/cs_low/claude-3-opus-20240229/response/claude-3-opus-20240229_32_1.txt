To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for technical pursuits over artistic ones.
3. The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, meaning that the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 25%.

Given the limited information, we cannot make a definitive determination. However, based on Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in artistic activities, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Considering the prior probability and the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.6 to 0.7.
