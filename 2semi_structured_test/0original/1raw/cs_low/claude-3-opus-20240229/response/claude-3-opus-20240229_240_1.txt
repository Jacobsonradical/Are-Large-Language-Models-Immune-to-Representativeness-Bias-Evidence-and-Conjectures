To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how his characteristics align with typical traits of computer science vs. humanities professors.

Key observations:
- 25% of the sample are computer science professors, 75% are humanities professors (base rates).
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.
- Some traits like being careful, talented, and ambitious are likely common to successful professors in both fields.

Given that coding and mathematical interests are specifically mentioned as Jason's hobbies, which seem more diagnostic of computer science, and that he lacks typically humanities-related hobbies, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is higher than the base rate of 25%.

However, the description is quite limited, and many other factors could influence this probability that aren't mentioned. So I'll make a conservative estimate, but higher than the base rate.
