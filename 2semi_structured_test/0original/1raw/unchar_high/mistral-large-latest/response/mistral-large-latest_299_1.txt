{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since there is no information in the description that would make it more likely that Jason is a humanities professor, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be proportional to the number of computer science professors in the sample. Therefore, the probability is 75/100 or 0.75.
