{"probability": "0.75"}

My answer is based on the fact that there are 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75. This is assuming that the description given is equally likely to apply to a professor from either field. The description does not provide any specific information that would make it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.
