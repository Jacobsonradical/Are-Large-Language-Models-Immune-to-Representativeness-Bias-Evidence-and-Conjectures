{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this estimation is that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making it three times more likely that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. The description provided does not contain any specific information that would suggest a higher likelihood of Jason being a professor in one field or the other, thus the probability is based on the sample distribution alone.
