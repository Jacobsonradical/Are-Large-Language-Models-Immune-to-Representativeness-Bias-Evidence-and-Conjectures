{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would directly link Jason to either the computer science or humanities field. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is higher, assuming that the chance of selecting any professor is equal. This is based solely on the sample distribution, not on any personal characteristics of Jason.
