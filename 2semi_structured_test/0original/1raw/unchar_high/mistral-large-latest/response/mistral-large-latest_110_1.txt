{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that there were 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Without any further information that might suggest Jason is more likely to be one or the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample, which is 75/100 or 0.75.
