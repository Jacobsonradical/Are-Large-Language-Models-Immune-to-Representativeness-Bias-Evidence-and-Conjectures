{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Since there were 75 successful professors in computer science and 25 in the humanities, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors. The given description does not provide any additional information that would suggest he is more likely to be in one field over the other. Therefore, the probability is based on the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors, which is 75/100 = 0.75.
