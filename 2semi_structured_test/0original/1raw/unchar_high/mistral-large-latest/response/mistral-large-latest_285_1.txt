{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide specific traits that would definitively categorize Jason as a professor in either computer science or the humanities. However, since the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and without any strong evidence suggesting otherwise, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be closer to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75.
