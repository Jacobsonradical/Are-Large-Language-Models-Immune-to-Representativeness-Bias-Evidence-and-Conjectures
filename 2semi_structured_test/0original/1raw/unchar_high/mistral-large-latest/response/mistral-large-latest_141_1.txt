{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether Jason is a professor of computer science or humanities. However, given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, it is statistically more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Therefore, I assigned a probability of 0.75, which corresponds to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
