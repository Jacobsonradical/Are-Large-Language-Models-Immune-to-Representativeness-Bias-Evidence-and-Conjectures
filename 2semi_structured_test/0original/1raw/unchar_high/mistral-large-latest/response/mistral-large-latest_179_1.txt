{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since there is no additional information in the description provided that would suggest a specific field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor should reflect the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.
