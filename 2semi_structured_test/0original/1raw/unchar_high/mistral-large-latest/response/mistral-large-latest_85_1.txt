{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any further information to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75/100 or 0.75.
