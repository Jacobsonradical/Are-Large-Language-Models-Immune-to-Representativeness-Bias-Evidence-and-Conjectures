{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would clearly indicate whether Jason is a professor of computer science or humanities. However, since the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is higher (75%) based on the sample distribution alone.
