{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that the sample size for computer science professors is 75 out of 100, which makes it more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors. However, it is important to note that the description provided does not give any specific information that would definitively link Jason to either the computer science or humanities field. Therefore, the probability is based solely on the sample size.
