{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide specific details that would definitively categorize Jason as a professor of computer science or humanities. However, since there are more computer science professors in the sample (75 out of 100), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is higher. This answer is a simple application of the base rate, not taking into account any potential correlations between personality traits and academic fields.
