{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would definitively categorize Jason as a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is higher based solely on the size of the sample groups. This does not mean that he is definitively a computer science professor, but the odds suggest a 75% chance.
