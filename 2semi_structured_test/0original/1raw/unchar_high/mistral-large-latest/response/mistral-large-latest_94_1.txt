{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any additional information that might suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, it is reasonable to base the probability on the proportions of professors from each field in the sample. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100, or 0.75.
