{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that there were 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Without any further information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, it's reasonable to assume that the probability he is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.
