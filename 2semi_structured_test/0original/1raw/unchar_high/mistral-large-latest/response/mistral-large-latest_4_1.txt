{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide specific information that would directly link Jason to either the computer science or humanities field. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor based purely on the proportion of professors from each field in the sample.
