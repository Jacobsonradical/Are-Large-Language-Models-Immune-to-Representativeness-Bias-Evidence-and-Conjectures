{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since no specific information about Jason's field of study or personality traits related to a particular discipline is provided, the probability that he is a computer science professor can be estimated based on the given sample distribution. Therefore, the probability is 75/(75+25) = 0.75.
