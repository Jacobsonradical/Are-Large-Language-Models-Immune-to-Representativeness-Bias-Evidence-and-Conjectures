{"probability": "0.75"}

The explanation for this answer is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information that might suggest that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of him being a computer science professor is proportional to their representation in the sample. Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/(75+25) = 0.75.
