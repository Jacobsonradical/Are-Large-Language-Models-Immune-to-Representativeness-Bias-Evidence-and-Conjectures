{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 professors from the humanities. Since no other information is given, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75 (75 out of 100).
