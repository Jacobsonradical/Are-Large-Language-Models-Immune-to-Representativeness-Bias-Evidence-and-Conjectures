{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since Jason's description does not provide any specific information related to his field of expertise, the probability that he is a computer science professor should be proportional to the number of computer science professors in the sample. Therefore, the probability is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
