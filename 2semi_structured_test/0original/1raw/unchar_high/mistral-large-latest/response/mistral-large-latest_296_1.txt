{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a professor in either computer science or the humanities. However, given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor simply based on the larger number of computer science professors included in the study.
