{"probability": "0.75"}

The description does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is a professor in computer science or the humanities. However, given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75% if we assume an equal chance for any professor to be selected. This answer is based on the provided sample distribution and not on any personal knowledge or stereotypes about the fields of study.
