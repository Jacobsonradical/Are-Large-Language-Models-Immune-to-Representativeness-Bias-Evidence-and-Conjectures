{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Given no additional information to suggest that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, it's reasonable to base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.
