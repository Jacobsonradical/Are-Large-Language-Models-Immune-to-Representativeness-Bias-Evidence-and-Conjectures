{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since Jason's description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest he belongs to either group, we can base our probability estimate on the proportion of professors from each discipline in the sample. So, there is a 0.75 probability that Jason is a computer science professor and a 0.25 probability that he is a humanities professor.
