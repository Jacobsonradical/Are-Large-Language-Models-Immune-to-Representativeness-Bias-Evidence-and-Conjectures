{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since Jason's description doesn't provide any specific information that would suggest he's more likely to be a humanities professor, we can base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.
