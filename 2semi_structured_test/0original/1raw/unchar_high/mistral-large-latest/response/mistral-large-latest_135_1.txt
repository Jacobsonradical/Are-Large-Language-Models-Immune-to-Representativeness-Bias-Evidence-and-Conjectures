{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that there are 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, the description does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be one or the other, so the probability is based solely on the sample size.
