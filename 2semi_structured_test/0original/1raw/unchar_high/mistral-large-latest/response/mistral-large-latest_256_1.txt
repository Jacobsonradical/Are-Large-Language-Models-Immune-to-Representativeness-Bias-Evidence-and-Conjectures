{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any further information tying Jason specifically to either field, we can only base the probability on the given sample distribution. Therefore, there is a 75% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
