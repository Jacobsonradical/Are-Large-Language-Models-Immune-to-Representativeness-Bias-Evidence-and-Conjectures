{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that there are 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 75/100 or 0.75, assuming that each professor has an equal chance of being selected. The description provided does not contain any specific information that would make it more or less likely for Jason to be a computer science professor.
