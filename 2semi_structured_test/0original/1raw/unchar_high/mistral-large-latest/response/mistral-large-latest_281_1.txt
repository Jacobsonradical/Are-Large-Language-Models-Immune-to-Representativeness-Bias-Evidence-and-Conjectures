{"probability": "0.75"}

My answer is based on the fact that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since Jason's description does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be a professor of one subject or the other, I have based my probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
