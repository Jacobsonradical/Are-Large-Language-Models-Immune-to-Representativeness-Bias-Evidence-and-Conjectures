{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Since no additional information is provided that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should correspond to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. This means that the probability is 0.75 (75 out of 100 professors).
