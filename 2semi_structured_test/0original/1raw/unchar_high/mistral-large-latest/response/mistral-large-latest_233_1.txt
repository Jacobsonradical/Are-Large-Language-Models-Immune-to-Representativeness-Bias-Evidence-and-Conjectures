{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without any further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be proportional to the size of the computer science group compared to the total number of professors. So, the probability is 75/100 = 0.75.
