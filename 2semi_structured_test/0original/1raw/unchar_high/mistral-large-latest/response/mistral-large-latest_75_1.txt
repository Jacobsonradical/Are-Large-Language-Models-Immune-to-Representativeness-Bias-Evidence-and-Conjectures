{"probability": "0.75"}

My answer is based on the fact that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, the most reasonable estimate is that the probability he is a computer science professor is 0.75 (75 out of 100 professors).
