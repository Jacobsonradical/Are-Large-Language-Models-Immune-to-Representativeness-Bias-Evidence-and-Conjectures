{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that there were more computer science professors (75) in the sample than humanities professors (25). Without any other information that could suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, the probability should reflect the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors. So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
