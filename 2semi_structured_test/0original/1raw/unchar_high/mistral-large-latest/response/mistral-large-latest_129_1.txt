{"probability": "0.75"}

The reason for this answer is that there are 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Since Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, without any specific information pointing to either discipline, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors should be proportional to the number of computer science professors in the sample. Therefore, the probability is 0.75 (75/100).
