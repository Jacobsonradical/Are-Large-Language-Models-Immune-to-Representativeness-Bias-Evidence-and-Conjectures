{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this is that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Given no other relevant information, we can base our probability on the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
