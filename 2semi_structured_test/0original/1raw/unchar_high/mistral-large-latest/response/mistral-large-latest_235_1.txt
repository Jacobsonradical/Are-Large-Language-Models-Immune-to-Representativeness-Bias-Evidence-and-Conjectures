{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this answer is that there were 75 computer science professors in the sample and 25 humanities professors. Without any additional information from the description that might suggest a particular field, we can only base our probability on the sample size. Therefore, there is a 75% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
