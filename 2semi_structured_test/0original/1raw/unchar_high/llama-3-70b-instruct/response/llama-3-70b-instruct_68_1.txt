{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field and are generally desirable in academia. The fact that Jason is well-liked by his colleagues also does not provide a strong indication of his field. Given that 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors, I would default to a probability of 0.75 that Jason is a computer science professor.
