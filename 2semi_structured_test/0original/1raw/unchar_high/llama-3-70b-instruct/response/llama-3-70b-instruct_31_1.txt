{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate of computer science professors is 75/100 = 0.75. The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be a humanities professor, so I will stick with the base rate.
