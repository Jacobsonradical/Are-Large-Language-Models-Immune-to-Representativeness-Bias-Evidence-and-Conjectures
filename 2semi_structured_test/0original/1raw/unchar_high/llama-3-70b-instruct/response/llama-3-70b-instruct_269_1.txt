{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that the description doesn't provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful academics in general. However, since the majority of the sample (75 out of 100) consists of computer science professors, it's more probable that Jason belongs to this group.
