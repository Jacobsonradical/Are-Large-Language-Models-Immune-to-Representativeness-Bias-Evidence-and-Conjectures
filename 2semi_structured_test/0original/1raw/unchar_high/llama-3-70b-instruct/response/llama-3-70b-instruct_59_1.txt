{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. The description doesn't provide any strong cues that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, so I'll stick with the prior probability.
