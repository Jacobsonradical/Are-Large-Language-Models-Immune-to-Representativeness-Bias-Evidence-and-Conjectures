{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate of a professor being from computer science is 0.75. The description doesn't provide any strong cues that would suggest Jason is more likely to be from humanities, so I'll stick with the base rate.
