{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would suggest Jason is a humanities professor, whereas the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are commonly associated with successful academics in general, and computer science professors in particular. Since 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors, I defaulted to the base rate probability.
