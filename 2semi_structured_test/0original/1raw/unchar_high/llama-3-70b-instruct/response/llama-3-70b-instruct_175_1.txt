{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: There is no information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The traits described, such as high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful professors in both fields. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor simply due to the larger sample size.
