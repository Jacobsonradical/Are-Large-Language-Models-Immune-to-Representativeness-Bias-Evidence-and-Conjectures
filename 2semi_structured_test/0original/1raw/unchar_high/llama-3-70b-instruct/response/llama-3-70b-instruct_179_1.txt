{"probability": "0.75"}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is a humanities professor, whereas the fact that he is 30 years old and has a high ability and strong motivation might be more typical of a computer science professor. Additionally, the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 75%, which also influences my answer.
