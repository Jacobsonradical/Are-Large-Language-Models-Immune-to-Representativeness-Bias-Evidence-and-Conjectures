{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field. However, since computer science is a field that tends to attract individuals with strong technical skills and a high level of motivation, I'm giving a slightly higher probability to Jason being a computer science professor.
