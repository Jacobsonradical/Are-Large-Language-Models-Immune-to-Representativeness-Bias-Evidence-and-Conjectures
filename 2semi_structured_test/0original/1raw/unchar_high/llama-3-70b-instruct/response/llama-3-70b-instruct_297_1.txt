{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. The description provided doesn't give any information that would significantly update this prior probability, so I'll stick with the prior probability.
