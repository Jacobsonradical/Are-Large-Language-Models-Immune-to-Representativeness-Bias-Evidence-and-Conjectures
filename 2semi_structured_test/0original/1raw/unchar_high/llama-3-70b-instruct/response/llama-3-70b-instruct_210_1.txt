My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are not unique to either field. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor simply due to the larger proportion of professors in that field.
