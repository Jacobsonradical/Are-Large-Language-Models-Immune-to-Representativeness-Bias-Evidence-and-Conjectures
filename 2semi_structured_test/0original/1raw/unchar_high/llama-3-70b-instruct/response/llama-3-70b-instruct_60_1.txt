My reasoning is that the description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful academics in general. The fact that Jason is well-liked by his colleagues also does not provide a strong indication of his field. Given that 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors, it is more likely that Jason is one of them.
