{"probability": "0.75"}

My reasoning is that there is no information in the description that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are generally desirable in academia and don't seem to be specific to one field or the other. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor simply due to the larger proportion of professors in that field.
