{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is a humanities professor, and the study has a larger proportion of computer science professors (75 out of 100). Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, I wouldn't assign a probability of 1, as the description is quite generic and doesn't provide any specific clues that would definitively point to computer science.
