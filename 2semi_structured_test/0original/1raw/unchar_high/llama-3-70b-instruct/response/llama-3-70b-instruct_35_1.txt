{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75. The description provided does not contain any information that would suggest Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor, so I would stick with the prior probability.
