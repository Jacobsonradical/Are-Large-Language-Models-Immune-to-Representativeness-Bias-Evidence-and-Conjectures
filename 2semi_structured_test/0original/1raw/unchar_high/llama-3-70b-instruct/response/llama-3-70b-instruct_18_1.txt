{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. The description does not provide any information that would significantly update this prior probability, so I will stick with the prior probability.
