My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is a humanities professor, whereas the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are more commonly associated with STEM fields like computer science. Additionally, the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample suggests that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.
