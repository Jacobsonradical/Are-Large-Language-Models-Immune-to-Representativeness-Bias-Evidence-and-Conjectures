{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful academics in general. However, since there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor simply due to the larger sample size.
