{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate of a professor being from computer science is 0.75. The description does not provide any information that would strongly suggest Jason is from the humanities, so I will stick with the base rate.
