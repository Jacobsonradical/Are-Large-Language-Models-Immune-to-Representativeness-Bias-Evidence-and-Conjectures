{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability and strong motivation, are likely to be common among successful professors in general. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, it's reasonable to assume that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor simply due to the larger representation in the sample.
