{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is a humanities professor, and the fact that he is 30 years old and has a strong motivation might suggest that he is in a more technical field like computer science, where youth and drive might be more valued. Additionally, the fact that there are 3 times as many computer science professors in the sample as humanities professors means that it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor by chance alone.
