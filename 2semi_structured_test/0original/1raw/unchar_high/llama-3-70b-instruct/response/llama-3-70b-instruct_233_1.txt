{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is as follows: since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate of computer science professors is 0.75. The description does not provide any specific information that would strongly suggest Jason is a humanities professor, so I will stick with the base rate.
