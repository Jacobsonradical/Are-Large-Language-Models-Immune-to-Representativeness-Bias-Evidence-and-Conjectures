{"probability": 0.75}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that suggests Jason is a humanities professor, whereas some characteristics like "high ability" and "strong motivation" might be more stereotypically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, the fact that there are 75 computer science professors in the sample and only 25 humanities professors means that the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is already higher.
