{"probability": "0.75"}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that would suggest Jason is a humanities professor, whereas the fact that he is 30 years old and has a "high ability" might suggest he is a computer science professor, given the stereotype that computer science is a field that values youth and technical skill. However, this is a weak inference, and the majority of the description is neutral, so I wouldn't put the probability too high.
