{"probability": "0.75"}

My reasoning is that there is no specific information in the description that would suggest Jason is a humanities professor, whereas the description does mention "high ability" and "strong motivation", which are traits that are often associated with success in a field like computer science. Additionally, the fact that there are 3 times as many computer science professors in the sample as humanities professors means that, all else being equal, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
