It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children, or possess high ability and motivation  relies on stereotypes and is not statistically sound. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description could easily apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
