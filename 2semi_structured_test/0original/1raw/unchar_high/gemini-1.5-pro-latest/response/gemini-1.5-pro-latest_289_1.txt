It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  There's nothing specifically suggesting a leaning towards either field.
* **Base rate neglected:**  We need to consider the base rate. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science. 

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need more information specific to either computer science or humanities in Jason's description.** 

**Therefore, any probability given would be a guess.**
