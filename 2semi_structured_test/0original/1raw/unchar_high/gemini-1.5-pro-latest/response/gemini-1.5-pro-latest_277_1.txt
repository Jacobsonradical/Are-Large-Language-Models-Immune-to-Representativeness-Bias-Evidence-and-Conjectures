It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description alone. The information provided offers no specific clues about his profession.  Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, young, or lacking children is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence. 
* **Description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in any field. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
