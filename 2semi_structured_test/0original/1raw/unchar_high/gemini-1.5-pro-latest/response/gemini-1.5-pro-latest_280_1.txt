It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors relevant to computer science or humanities. 

Since we know 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, there's a higher baseline probability of him belonging to that group. However, without any field-specific information, relying on the baseline would be a fallacy. 

Therefore, the probability remains the same as the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.
