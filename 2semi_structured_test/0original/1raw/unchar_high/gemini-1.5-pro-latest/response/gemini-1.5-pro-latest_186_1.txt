It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  The qualities mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are desirable traits in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means it's statistically more likely he's in computer science, it's not a guarantee.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.** 

To provide a meaningful probability, we would need more information in the description that is specifically relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "Cannot determine from the given information"}
