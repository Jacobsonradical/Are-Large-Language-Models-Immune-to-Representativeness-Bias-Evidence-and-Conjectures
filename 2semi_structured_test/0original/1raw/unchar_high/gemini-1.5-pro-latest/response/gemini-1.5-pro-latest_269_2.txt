It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children at 30, or possess high ability and strong motivation is stereotypical and inaccurate.  
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description lacks specific details about Jason's work style, research interests, or other factors that might differentiate between computer science and humanities professors.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "0.5"}
