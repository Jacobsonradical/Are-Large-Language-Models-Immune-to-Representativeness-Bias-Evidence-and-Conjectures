It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be "high ability" or that humanities professors are less likely to be "well-liked" is biased and inaccurate.
* **The description is generic:**  The information about age, marital status, and even personality could apply to professors in many disciplines.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This reflects the fact that 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
