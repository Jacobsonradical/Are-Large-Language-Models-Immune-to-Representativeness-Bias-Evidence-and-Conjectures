It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence.  
* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description could easily fit a successful professor in *any* field. There's nothing uniquely indicative of computer science.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.  Without any useful information from the description, the best we can do is rely on the initial proportion.
