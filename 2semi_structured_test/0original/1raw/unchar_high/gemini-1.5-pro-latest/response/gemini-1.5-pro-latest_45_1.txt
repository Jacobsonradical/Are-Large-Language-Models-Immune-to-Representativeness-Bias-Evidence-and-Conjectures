I cannot provide a meaningful probability without more information about personality traits common in each field. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a successful professor in either computer science or the humanities.  There's no mention of specific traits that might hint at a preference for one field over the other.
* **Base rates matter:**  The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor would be from computer science. However, without personality insights, this base rate is not very informative.

**To give you a more accurate probability, I would need information like:**

* **Personality test results:** What specific traits did the tests reveal about Jason? 
* **Field-specific traits:** Did the study identify any personality traits that were significantly more common among successful computer science professors compared to humanities professors? 

Without this additional context, any probability I provide would be purely speculative.
