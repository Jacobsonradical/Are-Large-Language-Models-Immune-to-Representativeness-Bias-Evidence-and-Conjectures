I cannot give a reliable probability estimate based on the information given. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  The description relies on very general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked). These traits are desirable in many professions and don't specifically point towards computer science or humanities.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample of 100 is relatively small to draw strong conclusions about typical traits.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** The description only tells us about Jason, not how he compares to other professors in the study.  To estimate probability, we'd need information about how common these traits were in *both* the computer science and humanities groups.

**In short, relying on this description would likely lead to biased guessing.**
