It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided.  

Here's why:

* **The description lacks relevant information:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are positive attributes that could apply to successful individuals in numerous fields, not just computer science. 
* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be like the description than humanities professors would be falling into harmful stereotypes. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the baseline probability 75%.
