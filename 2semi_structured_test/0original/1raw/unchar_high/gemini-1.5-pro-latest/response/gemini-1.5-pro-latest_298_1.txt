I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Description Bias:** The description of Jason is very generic and doesn't offer any specific traits that would be more common in computer science or the humanities.  It highlights positive attributes applicable to many successful professionals.
* **Small Sample Size:**  While 100 professors seem like a decent number, the study doesn't tell us the overall gender breakdown of professors in those fields. If computer science has significantly more male professors than the humanities, that would influence the probability.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** To estimate the probability, I'd need information about common personality traits found in the study *for both computer science and humanities professors*. This description alone doesn't provide that comparative data.

**To get a meaningful probability, I'd need more information about how personality traits differed or were similar between the two groups of professors in the study.**
