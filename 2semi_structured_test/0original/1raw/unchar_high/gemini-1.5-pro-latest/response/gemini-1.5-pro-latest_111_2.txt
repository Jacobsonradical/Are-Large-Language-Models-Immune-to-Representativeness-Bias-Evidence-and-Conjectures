It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based on the description provided. The information given describes general positive traits but offers no specific insights into whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:**  Assuming professions based on limited personality descriptions relies on stereotypes.  
* **The description is generic:** The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields.
* **Sample size is irrelevant without relevant information:** Knowing the study's composition doesn't help without Jason's specific traits linking him to either field.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being in the humanities:

{"probability": "0.5"}
