I cannot provide a probability estimate based solely on the description of Jason. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** It lacks any information specifically related to personality traits commonly associated with either computer science or humanities professors.  A tendency towards introversion/extroversion, methodical thinking vs. creative approaches, etc., would be more informative.
* **The sample size difference is a distraction:** While there are three times as many computer science professors in the study, this fact alone is not enough to draw a conclusion about Jason. 

To provide a meaningful probability, I would need more information about the specific personality traits revealed by the tests and how these traits correlate with academic disciplines. 

**Therefore, any probability estimate I provide would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
