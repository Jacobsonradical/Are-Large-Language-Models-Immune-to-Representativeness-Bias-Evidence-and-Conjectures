It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have specific personality traits is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Limited Information:** The description provides general personality traits and demographics common to many successful individuals, regardless of their profession. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some statistically significant differences between the personality traits of computer science and humanities professors in the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions.

**Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to a higher prevalence in either field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

The probability is 0.75 because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
