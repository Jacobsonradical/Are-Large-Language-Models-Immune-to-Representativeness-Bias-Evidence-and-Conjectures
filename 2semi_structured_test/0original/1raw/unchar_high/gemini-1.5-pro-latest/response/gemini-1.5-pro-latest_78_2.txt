It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:** While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The description provided could easily apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just academia. 
* **Base rate matters:** We know that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of computer science professors in the sample.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to personality traits specifically associated with either field, the most accurate probability is based solely on the base rate.**
