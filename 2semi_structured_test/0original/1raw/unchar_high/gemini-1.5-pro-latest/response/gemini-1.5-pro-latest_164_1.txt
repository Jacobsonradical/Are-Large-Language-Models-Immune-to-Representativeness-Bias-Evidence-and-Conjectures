I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science. There's nothing specifically indicating a proclivity towards a technical field. 
* **Base rate is important:**  To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher starting probability that a randomly selected professor would be from computer science.
* **No relevant personality traits:** The description doesn't mention any personality traits that are stereotypically (and importantly, statistically) associated with either computer science or humanities professors.

**To get a meaningful probability, you would need information about how the personality traits identified in the study relate to the two groups of professors.**  For example, if the study found that a specific trait was significantly more common among computer science professors, and Jason's description included that trait, then we could make a more informed estimate.
