It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation plays into harmful stereotypes.  
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in *any* field. There's nothing uniquely suggestive of computer science.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
