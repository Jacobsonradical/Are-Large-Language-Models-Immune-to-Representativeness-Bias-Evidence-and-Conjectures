It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** While we might have stereotypes about the personalities of computer science professors versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased.
* **Description is generic:** The description provided applies to many successful individuals regardless of their profession.  
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were personality differences between the two groups, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw conclusions from. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

{"probability": "0.75"}
