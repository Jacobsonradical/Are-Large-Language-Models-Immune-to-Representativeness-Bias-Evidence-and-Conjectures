It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming all computer science professors are similar (high ability, motivated) or that humanities professors are different is inaccurate and potentially biased. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description could easily apply to a successful lawyer, entrepreneur, doctor, etc.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as his representation in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There's a 75% chance Jason is from the computer science group (75 out of 100 professors). 
* Without more information specific to computer science or humanities, we cannot make an informed guess beyond the initial sample proportions.
