I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his area of expertise. 
* **Base rate bias:**  The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of computer science professors in the sample. Simply guessing "more likely computer science" based on this bias would be statistically flawed without more information about Jason.

**To provide a meaningful probability, I would need more information in the description that is specifically relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.**
