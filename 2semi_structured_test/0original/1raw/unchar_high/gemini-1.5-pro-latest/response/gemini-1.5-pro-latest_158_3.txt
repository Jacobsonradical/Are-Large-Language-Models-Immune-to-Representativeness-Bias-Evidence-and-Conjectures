It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could easily apply to successful professors in *any* field, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific clues:**  There's nothing in the description hinting at a particular interest or aptitude for computer science (or the humanities, for that matter). 

Since we have no useful information to differentiate Jason, the base rates of the study are our only guide. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study:
