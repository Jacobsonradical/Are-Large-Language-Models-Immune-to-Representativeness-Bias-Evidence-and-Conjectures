I cannot give a probability based on the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **No comparative information:** We don't know if certain traits were more common in one group of professors versus the other. 
* **Small sample size:**  100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw strong conclusions about entire fields. 

**To provide a meaningful probability, I'd need more information about how personality traits differed between the computer science and humanities professors in the study.**
