I cannot determine the probability based on the given description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The provided information about Jason (age, marital status, work ethic, and general likability) could apply to successful professors in either computer science or the humanities. 
* **No field-specific indicators:** There are no clues in the description that hint at Jason's specific research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might be more common in one field versus the other.
* **Base rate bias:**  We know that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. A naive approach might consider a 75% probability based on this split. However, without any discriminating information about Jason, using the base rate alone would be a fallacy.

To estimate the probability, I would need more information related to personality traits or behaviors that differentiate successful computer science professors from successful humanities professors.
