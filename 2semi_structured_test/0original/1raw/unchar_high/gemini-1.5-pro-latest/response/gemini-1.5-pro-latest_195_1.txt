It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal for both.  Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a 75% chance he's in computer science.
