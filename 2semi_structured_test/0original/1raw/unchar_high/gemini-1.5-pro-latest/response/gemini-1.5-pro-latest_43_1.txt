I cannot give you a probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science.  
* **No comparative information:** We don't know if these traits are more or less common in computer science professors versus humanities professors. 
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw conclusions about entire fields.

To estimate the probability, I would need more information about how the personality traits observed in the study correlate with being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
