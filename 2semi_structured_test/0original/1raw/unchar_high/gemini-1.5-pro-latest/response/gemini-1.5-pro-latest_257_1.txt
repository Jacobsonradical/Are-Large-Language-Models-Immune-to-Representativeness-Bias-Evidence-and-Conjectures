It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies to successful professionals in many fields, not just computer science. 

Since there's no information linking the description specifically to computer science, and the sample has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability is based on the overall proportion in the sample.

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
