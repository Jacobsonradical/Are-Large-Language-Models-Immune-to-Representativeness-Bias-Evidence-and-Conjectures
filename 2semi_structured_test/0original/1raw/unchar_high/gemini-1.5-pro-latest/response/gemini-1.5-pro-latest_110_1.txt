It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We have no information about the personality descriptions of other professors in the study, making it impossible to assess if Jason's profile leans towards one field or another.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. **
