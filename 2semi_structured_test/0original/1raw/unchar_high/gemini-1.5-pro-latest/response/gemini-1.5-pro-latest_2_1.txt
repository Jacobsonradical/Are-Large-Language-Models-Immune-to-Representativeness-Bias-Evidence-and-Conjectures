It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science.  
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field of study.
* **Sample bias is unknown:** We don't know if there are any inherent biases in the selection of the 100 professors. 

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.** 

To make a more informed estimation, we would need additional information that could potentially correlate with being a computer science professor. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}
