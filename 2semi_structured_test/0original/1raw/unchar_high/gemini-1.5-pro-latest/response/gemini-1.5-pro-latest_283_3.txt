It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  While there might be stereotypical images of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are unreliable and often biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The provided description could easily apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.
* **Base rates are crucial:**  We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  This means it was initially more likely Jason was in computer science simply because there were more of them in the study. However, the description offers no information to adjust our understanding of that initial likelihood.

**Therefore, without any information linking the personality description to traits more common in either field, the best we can do is rely on the base rate.**
