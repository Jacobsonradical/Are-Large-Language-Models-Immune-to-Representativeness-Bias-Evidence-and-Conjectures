It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The description highlights general traits of intelligence, ambition, and social adeptness, which could easily apply to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
* **Lack of Diagnostic Information:** The description provides no specific clues about Jason's research interests, hobbies, communication style, or other factors that might be more common in one field versus the other.

**Important Note:** This assumes the description was chosen randomly. If there was any bias in selecting this description (e.g., the researchers are more likely to showcase descriptions of computer science professors), the probability would change.
