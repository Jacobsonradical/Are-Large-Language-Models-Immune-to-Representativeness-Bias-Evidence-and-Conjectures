It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Demographics:** Being 30, married, and childless doesn't strongly correlate with either computer science or humanities. 
* **Personality:** High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive attributes found in successful individuals across disciplines.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because there is a 75% chance that a randomly selected professor from the study is in computer science (75 out of 100).
