It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 years old is a plausible age for a tenured professor in both computer science and humanities. 
* **Marital Status:** Being married with or without children is not indicative of a specific academic field.
* **Personality:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive qualities found in successful individuals across various professions. 

**Therefore, without any information linking his traits or interests specifically to computer science or humanities, the probability is equal to the base rate in the study.**
