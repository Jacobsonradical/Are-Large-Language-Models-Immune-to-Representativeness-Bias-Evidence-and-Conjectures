I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science.  
* **No comparative information:** We lack information about the typical personality traits found in the study for either computer science or humanities professors. To estimate a probability, we'd need some comparative data. 

**To illustrate:** If the study found that 90% of computer science professors were described as "highly motivated" but only 10% of humanities professors were, then the description of Jason being "highly motivated" would increase the probability of him being a computer science professor. 

**Without such comparative data, any probability estimate would be a guess.**
