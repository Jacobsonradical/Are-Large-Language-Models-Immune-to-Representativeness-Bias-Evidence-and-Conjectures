It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professionals in both computer science and the humanities. 

Since the sample size is split 75/25 between computer science and humanities, there's a higher base rate for computer science professors. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

{"probability": "0.75"}
