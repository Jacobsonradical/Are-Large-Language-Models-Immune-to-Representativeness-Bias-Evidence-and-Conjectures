It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided.  The description is full of generic positive traits that could apply to a professor in *any* field. 

Here's why this makes it impossible to give a meaningful probability:

* **Base Rate:** The study had 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of computer science professors in the sample to begin with. Simply guessing "computer science" based on the base rate alone would be more accurate than trying to use the description.
* **Stereotypes:** We must be careful not to let stereotypes about computer scientists vs. humanities professors influence our judgment.  The description doesn't touch on any stereotypes.

**Therefore:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

**Explanation:** Without any information related to Jason's work or personality that could hint at his field, the only logical probability is to default to a 50/50 chance, reflecting the fact that we have no useful information to sway us from the base rate.
