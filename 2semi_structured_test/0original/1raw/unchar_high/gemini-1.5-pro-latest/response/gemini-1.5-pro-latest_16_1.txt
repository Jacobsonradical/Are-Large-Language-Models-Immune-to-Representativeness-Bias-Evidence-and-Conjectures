It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be "high ability" or that humanities professors are less likely to be "well-liked" is biased and inaccurate.
* **The description is generic:**  The description could easily apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just academia. 

**Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to a specific field, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.**

{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the baseline probability 75%.
