I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. Here's why:

* **Lack of Comparative Information:** The description of Jason is entirely neutral. It doesn't offer any details that are stereotypically associated with either computer science or humanities professors. 
* **Stereotypes are Unreliable:** Even if the description contained traits often linked to computer science (like introversion), relying on stereotypes is problematic and inaccurate.  
* **Sample Bias (Potentially):** We don't know if the selection of professors within each field was random. There might be underlying biases in the study's sample.

**To estimate the probability, I would need information that reveals something meaningful about Jason's field, such as:**

* **Research interests:**  Does he study artificial intelligence, medieval literature, etc.?
* **Teaching style:**  Is he known for his engaging lectures or his hands-on coding workshops?
* **Publications:**  What kind of journals or conferences does he publish in? 

**Without such information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
