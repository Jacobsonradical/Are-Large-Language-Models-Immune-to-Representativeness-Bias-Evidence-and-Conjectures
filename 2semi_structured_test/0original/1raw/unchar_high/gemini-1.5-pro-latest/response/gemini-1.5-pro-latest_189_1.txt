It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general traits like intelligence, motivation, and social skills. These traits can be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study as humanities professors. However, this doesn't directly translate to a 75% chance of Jason being in computer science. We lack information about the overall prevalence of these personality traits within each field.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
