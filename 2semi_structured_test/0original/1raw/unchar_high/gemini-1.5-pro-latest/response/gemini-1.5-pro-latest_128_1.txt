It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  Attributes like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not unique to computer science or humanities. They are desirable traits in many professions.
* **The sample size is irrelevant without differentiating information:** Knowing the study involved 75 computer science and 25 humanities professors is statistically relevant, but only if the description provided clues leaning towards one field or the other.

Therefore, without any information connecting Jason's traits or interests to computer science, the probability is equivalent to a random guess based on the sample composition.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**  Since 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, there's a 75% chance Jason belongs to that group based purely on the sample's proportions.
