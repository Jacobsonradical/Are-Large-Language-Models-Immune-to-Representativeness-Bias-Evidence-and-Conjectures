It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's area of expertise. 

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.  

**{"probability": "0.5"}** 

I'm providing 0.5 as the probability because, without any other information, there's a 50/50 chance based purely on the sample size of the study (75 computer science vs. 25 humanities). However, this is NOT an informed probability based on the description itself.
