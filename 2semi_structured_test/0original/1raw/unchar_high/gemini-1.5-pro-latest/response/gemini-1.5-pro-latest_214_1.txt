It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are desirable qualities in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means there's a higher raw number of computer science professors, it doesn't tell us anything specific about Jason.

**To provide a probability, we would need more information that correlates with either computer science or humanities.**

Therefore, I cannot give a meaningful probability.
