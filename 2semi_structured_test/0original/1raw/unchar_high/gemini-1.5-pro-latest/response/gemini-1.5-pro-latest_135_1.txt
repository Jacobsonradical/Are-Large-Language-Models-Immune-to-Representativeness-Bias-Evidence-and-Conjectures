It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the baseline probability of any professor in the study being a computer science professor, which is 75/100.
