It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are not unique to computer science or humanities professors. 
* **The sample size is irrelevant in this case:** Knowing the study's composition doesn't help us profile Jason individually.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.  

**{"probability": "0.5"}** 

This represents a 50/50 chance, reflecting the lack of information to sway us toward either computer science or humanities.
