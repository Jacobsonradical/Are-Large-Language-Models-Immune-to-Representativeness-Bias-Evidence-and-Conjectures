It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies to successful academics in general and doesn't offer any specific clues about computer science versus humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Sample Bias:** The study has a significantly larger proportion of computer science professors (75%) compared to humanities (25%). This alone makes it statistically more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.
* **Lack of Field-Specific Indicators:**  The description highlights positive traits common to success in many fields, not just computer science. 

Therefore, the most accurate probability is based on the sample composition:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```
