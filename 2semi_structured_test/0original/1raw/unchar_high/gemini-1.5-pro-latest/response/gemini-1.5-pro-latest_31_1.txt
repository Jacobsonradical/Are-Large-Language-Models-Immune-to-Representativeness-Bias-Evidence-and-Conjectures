It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks relevant information:** The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are applicable to successful individuals in *many* fields, not just computer science. 
* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to fit this description is based on stereotypes, not evidence.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm providing 0.5 as the probability because, in the absence of any useful information, the baseline assumption should be a 50/50 chance for either field.
