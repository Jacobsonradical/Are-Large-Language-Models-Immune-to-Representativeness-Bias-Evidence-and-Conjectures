It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The information provided (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, married without children, or have certain personality traits is a generalization.  

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group, which is 50%.**

{"probability": "0.5"}
