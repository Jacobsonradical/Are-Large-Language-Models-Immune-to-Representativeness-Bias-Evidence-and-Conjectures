I cannot give you a probability based on the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is too general:**  The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No comparative information:** We don't know if these traits are more or less common among the computer science professors compared to the humanities professors. 
* **Small sample size:** While 100 people might seem like a lot, it's a small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about personality traits and career fields.

**To give you a meaningful probability, I would need more information about:**

* **Personality traits that distinguish the two groups:** Are there any traits that the study found to be significantly more prevalent in one group versus the other?
* **How Jason's description aligns with those findings:**  Does Jason exhibit any traits that were found to be particularly common among computer science professors? 

Without this additional information, any probability I provide would be a guess.
