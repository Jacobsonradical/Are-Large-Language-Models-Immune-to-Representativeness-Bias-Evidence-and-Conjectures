It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  We cannot and should not assume someone's profession based on general personality traits or demographics like age and marital status. 
* **The description is generic:** The description provided could easily apply to a successful individual in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
