It is impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information provided lacks any specific details related to personality traits, research interests, or other factors that might distinguish between computer science and humanities professors. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
* This means 75 out of 100 participants were computer science professors.
* Therefore, there is a 75% chance (or a probability of 0.75) that any randomly chosen description from this study belongs to a computer science professor.
