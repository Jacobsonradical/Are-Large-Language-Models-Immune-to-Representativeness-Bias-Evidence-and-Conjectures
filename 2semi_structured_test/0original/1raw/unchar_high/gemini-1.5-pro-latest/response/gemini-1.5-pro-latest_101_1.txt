It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common to many successful professionals, regardless of their academic discipline. 

Therefore, given the lack of information related to Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

Here's why:

* **Base rate:** 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science, establishing a 75% base rate.
* **Lack of specific information:** The description does not provide any clues that would increase or decrease the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. 

Without further information relevant to the distinction between the two fields, we must rely on the base rate.
