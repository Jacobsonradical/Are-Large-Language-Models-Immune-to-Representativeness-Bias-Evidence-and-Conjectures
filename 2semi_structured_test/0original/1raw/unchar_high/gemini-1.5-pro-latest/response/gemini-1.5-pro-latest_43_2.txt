It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:**  The description lacks any hints about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might suggest a leaning towards computer science or humanities.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* There's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science (75 out of 100).
* Without any additional information, we have to rely on the original proportions.
