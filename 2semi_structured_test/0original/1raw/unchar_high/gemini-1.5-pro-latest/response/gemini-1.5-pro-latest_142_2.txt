It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's interests, hobbies, teaching style, or research areas that might hint at his field.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** While the study had more computer science professors, knowing the overall sample composition doesn't help us in this individual case.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as a random guess, which is equivalent to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**
