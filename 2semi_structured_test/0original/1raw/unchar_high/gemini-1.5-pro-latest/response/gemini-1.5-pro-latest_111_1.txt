It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. This means even if we had *no* information about Jason, the prior probability of him being in computer science would be higher (75%).

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**

**Instead of providing a probability, I would emphasize that the question is unanswerable with the current data.**
