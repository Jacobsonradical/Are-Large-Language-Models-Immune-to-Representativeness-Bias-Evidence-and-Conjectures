It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights positive personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are not specific to computer science or humanities. Successful individuals in many professions likely share these traits.
* **Demographics:**  While the description provides age and marital status, these factors are also not indicative of a specific academic field.

**Therefore, without more information related to Jason's research, teaching, or interests, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "0.5"} 

While I cannot give a more informed probability, I am defaulting to 0.5 because the sample size of computer science professors (75) is larger than the sample size of humanities professors (25).
