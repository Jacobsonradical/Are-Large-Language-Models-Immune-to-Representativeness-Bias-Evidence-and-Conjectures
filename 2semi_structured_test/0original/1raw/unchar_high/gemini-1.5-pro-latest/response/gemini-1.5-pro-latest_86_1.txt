It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is small:**  While there were more computer science professors in the study, a sample size of 75 and 25 respectively is not large enough to draw strong conclusions about personality traits being definitively linked to one field or the other.

**Therefore, I cannot give you a probability. Any number I provide would be a random guess.** 

To estimate the probability, we would need more information about personality traits that differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors, based on the study's findings.
