It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Base rates are crucial:**  Knowing that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors is essential.  There's a higher baseline probability that any randomly selected professor from the study would be from computer science.

**Without considering the base rates, any probability estimate would be a guess.** 

To provide a meaningful probability, I need more information or a different approach.
