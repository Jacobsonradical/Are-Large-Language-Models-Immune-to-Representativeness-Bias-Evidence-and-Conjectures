It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Personality is not exclusive:**  While there might be some personality traits more common in certain professions, they are not exclusive.  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are valuable in many fields, not just computer science.
* **The description is vague:** The information about Jason is very general. It lacks any specific details about his research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field of study. 

Therefore, I cannot give you a probability. 

**{"probability": "N/A"}**
