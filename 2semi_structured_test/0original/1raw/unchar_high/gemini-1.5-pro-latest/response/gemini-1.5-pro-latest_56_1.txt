It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights positive personality traits and circumstances (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) that could be equally applicable to professors in computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
* This means 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science.
* Therefore, there's a 75% chance (or a probability of 0.75) that any randomly chosen professor from this study is a computer science professor.
