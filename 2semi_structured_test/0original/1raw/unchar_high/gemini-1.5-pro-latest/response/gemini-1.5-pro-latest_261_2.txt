It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:**  75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science. This means there is a 75% chance that any randomly selected professor from the group is in computer science.
* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description offers no specific clues about Jason's research, interests, or teaching that would make one field more likely than the other.
