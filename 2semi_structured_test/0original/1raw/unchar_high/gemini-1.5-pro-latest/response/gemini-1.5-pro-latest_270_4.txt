It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equivalent to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
