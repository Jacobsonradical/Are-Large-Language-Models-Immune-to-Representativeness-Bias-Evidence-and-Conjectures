It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be "high ability" and "strongly motivated" is a harmful stereotype.  Humanities professors require those same traits.
* **Description is vague:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that would hint at his field.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**
