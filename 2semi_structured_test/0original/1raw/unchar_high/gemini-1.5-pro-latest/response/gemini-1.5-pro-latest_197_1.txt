It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general traits like intelligence, work ethic, and social skills. These can be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just computer science.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means there's a higher chance of any random professor being from computer science, it doesn't tell us anything specific about Jason. 

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be a guess.** 

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm providing 0.5 as the probability, but it's crucial to understand this represents a lack of information, not an actual 50/50 chance.
