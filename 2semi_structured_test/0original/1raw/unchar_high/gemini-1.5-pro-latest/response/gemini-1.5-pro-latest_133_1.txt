It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given, such as age, marital status, personality traits, and work relationships, is stereotypical and does not offer any specific insight into his academic field. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the study.
* This means the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
* The description doesn't give us any information to adjust this prior probability.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid applying stereotypes when making judgments about individuals.  The description provided could easily describe a successful professor in any field.
