It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to either field.** It highlights general positive traits (high ability, motivation, good reputation) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed.** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means there's a higher chance of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science, it doesn't tell us anything specific about *Jason*.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}**
