It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have certain personality traits is stereotypical and inaccurate.  
* **Insufficient Information:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any randomly selected professor from the study being in computer science.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
