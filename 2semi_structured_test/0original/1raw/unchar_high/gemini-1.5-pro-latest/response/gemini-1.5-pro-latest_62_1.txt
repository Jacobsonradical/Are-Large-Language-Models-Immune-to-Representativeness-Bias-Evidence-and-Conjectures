I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in computer science or humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his field of expertise.
* **Stereotypes are not reliable:**  It's tempting to draw on stereotypes (e.g., computer scientists are more likely to be male, married young) but these are unreliable and potentially biased. 

**To estimate the probability, I would need information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors within the study.** 

For example:

* **Personality traits:**  Did the study find any personality traits that were significantly more common in one group over the other?
* **Background information:** Are there any details about Jason's upbringing, hobbies, or research interests that might be relevant?

Without such information, any probability estimate would be pure guesswork.
