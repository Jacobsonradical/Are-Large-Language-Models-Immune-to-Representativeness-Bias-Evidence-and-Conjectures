It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is relying on stereotypes. These stereotypes don't accurately reflect the diversity within academia.
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in any field. It lacks any specific details that would hint towards computer science or humanities. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor.
