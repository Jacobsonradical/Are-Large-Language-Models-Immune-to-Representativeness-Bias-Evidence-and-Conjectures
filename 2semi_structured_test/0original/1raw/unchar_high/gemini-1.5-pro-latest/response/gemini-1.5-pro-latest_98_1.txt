It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks relevant information:** The description focuses on Jason's age, marital status, personality (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked), and professional standing. None of these are particularly indicative of being in computer science vs. humanities. 
* **Base rate is important:** We know that 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) for a randomly chosen professor to be in computer science. However, the description doesn't give us any information to adjust our estimate from that base rate.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be pure speculation.**
