It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:**  The study includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This imbalance makes it more likely that a randomly chosen professor would be from computer science.

**To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate:**

* **Base rate:** The prior probability of an event before any specific information is given. In this case, the base rate of a professor in the study being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

**Without any information linking Jason specifically to computer science, the probability is equal to the base rate.**

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
