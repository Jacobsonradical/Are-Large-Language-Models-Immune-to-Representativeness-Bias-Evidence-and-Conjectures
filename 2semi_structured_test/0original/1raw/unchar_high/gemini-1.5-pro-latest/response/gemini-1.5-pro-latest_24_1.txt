It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes generic traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Demographics:**  Being a 30-year-old married man without children doesn't correlate strongly with either computer science or humanities.
* **Personality:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are positive traits found in successful individuals across many professions. 

**Therefore, without further information relevant to the specific characteristics of computer science or humanities professors, the probability is equal to the base rate in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Explanation:**

Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, the prior probability (without the description) of Jason being a computer science professor is 75%, or 0.75.
