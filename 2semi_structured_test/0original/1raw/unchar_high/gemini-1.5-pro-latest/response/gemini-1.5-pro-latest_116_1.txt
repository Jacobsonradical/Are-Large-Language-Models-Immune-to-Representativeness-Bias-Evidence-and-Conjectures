I cannot give a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful academic in many fields, not just computer science or humanities.  There are no specific details that hint at his field of study.
* **Base rate is crucial:** To estimate the probability, I need to know the base rate â€“ the proportion of computer science professors in the original sample.  You mentioned 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  

To calculate the probability, I would need to use Bayesian reasoning, taking into account both the base rate and any evidence provided in the description (which, in this case, is not informative).
