It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These can apply to successful individuals in any academic field.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions about entire professions.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We have no information about the personality profiles of the other professors in the study. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially a coin toss:**
