I'm sorry, but I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities.  There are no details about his research interests, teaching style, hobbies, or anything else that might hint at his field. 
* **Base rate bias:** To estimate the probability accurately, we need to consider the base rates. We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher baseline chance (75%) of any random professor in the study being from computer science. However, the generic description doesn't give us any specific evidence to adjust our estimate from this baseline.

**To get a more informative probability, I would need additional details about Jason that are more specific to his profession.**
