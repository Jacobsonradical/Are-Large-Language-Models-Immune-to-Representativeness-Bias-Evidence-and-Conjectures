It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science. 
* **The description lacks specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's research interests, hobbies, communication style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be based on pure speculation. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

Since we have no useful information to bias us, the safest assumption is that there's an equal chance of Jason being in either field (50/50).
