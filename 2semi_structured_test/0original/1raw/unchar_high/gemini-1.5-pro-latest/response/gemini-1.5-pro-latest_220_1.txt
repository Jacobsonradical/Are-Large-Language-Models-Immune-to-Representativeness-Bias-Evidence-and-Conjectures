It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given that the sample size is 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate within the sample.
