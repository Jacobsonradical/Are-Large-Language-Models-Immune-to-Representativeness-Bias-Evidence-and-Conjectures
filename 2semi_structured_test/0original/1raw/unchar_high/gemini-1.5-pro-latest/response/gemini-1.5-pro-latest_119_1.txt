It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits can be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just computer science.
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study's sample size is relatively small, and extrapolating broader probabilities from it is not statistically sound. 

**To provide a probability, we would need more information that could potentially correlate with either field, such as:**

* Research interests
* Hobbies
* Specific skills mentioned

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be purely speculative.**
