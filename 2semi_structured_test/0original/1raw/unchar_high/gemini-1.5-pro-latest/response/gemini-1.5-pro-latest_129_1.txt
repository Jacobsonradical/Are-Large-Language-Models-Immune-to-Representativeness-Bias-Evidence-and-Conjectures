It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personality traits and circumstances that could be equally applicable to individuals in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, given that there is no information in the description to differentiate between the two groups, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the baseline probability of a randomly selected professor from the study belonging to that field.

Here's how to calculate the probability:

* **Total computer science professors:** 75
* **Total professors:** 100
* **Probability:** 75/100 = 0.75

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```
