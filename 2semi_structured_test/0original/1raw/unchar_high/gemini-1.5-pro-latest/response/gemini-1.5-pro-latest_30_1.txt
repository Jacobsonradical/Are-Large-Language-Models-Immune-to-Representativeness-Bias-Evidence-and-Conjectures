I cannot provide a probability based on the description of Jason. Here's why:

* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description focuses on positive personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could easily apply to successful professionals in *any* field, not just computer science. There's nothing in the description that is particularly associated with computer science or the humanities.
* **Bias Introduction:**  Knowing the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors might tempt you to guess a higher probability for computer science. However, this would be statistically flawed reasoning.  

**To calculate a meaningful probability, we would need information that is actually predictive of a career in computer science,** such as:

* **Specific Interests:**  Does Jason enjoy problem-solving, coding, or working with technology?
* **Background:** Did Jason excel in mathematics or logic-based subjects? Does he have prior experience in the tech industry? 

**Without such information, any probability I provide would be arbitrary and not based on the evidence given.**
