It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description lacks specifics:**  The description offers generic positive traits that could apply to professors in any field. There's no mention of teaching style, research interests, or other clues.

**Therefore, I cannot give a probability other than a random guess.  Since there's a 75% chance of a randomly selected professor in the study being in computer science, my answer is:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

**Important:** This answer is based solely on the study's sample composition, not on Jason's description.
