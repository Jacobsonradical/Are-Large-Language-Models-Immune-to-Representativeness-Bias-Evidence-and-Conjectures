It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that would hint at his profession.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

**Important Note:**  I'm assuming a 50/50 chance since the description doesn't provide any evidence to favor one field over the other.
