It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that would make Jason more likely to be in one field over the other. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes the description selection was truly random. If there's any bias in how the description was chosen, the probability might change.
