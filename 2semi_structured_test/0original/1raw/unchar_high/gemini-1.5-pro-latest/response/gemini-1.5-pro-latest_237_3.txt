It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While we might have preconceived notions about the personalities of people in different professions, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and unhelpful. 
* **The description is generic:** The description focuses on positive attributes that could be found in successful individuals across various fields.  

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

**{"probability": "0.75"}** 

This is because there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors in the study.
