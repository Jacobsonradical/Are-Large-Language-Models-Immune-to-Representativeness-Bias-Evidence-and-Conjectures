It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science.
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw strong conclusions about entire professions. 
* **Lack of comparative information:**  We lack information about the personality descriptions of other professors in the study.  To estimate a probability, we'd need to know how common or unique Jason's traits are within each group (computer science vs. humanities).

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on evidence.**
