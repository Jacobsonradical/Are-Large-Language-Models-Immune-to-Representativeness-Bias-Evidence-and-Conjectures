It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw strong conclusions about entire professions.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We don't know anything about the typical descriptions of the humanities professors in the study. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially a coin toss:**

{"probability": "0.5"}
