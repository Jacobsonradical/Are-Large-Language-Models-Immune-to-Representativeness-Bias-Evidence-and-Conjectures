It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have specific personality traits is based on stereotypes and not factual evidence. 
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description doesn't mention anything related to teaching style, research interests, or other factors that might hint at Jason's field.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```
