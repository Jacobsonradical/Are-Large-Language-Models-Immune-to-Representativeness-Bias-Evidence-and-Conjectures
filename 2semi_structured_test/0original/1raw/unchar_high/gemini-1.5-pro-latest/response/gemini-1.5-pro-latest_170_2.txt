It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) is stereotypical and doesn't offer any specific insights into whether Jason is more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:** While there might be common personality traits within specific fields, relying on stereotypes is inaccurate and can perpetuate biases. 
* **Individual variation:**  People within the same profession are diverse. Many different personalities can thrive in both computer science and humanities. 

**Therefore, without more information relevant to the specific demands and characteristics of these fields, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 
 
 I'm defaulting to 0.5 because, with no useful information, the odds are 50/50 based simply on the study's sample size.
