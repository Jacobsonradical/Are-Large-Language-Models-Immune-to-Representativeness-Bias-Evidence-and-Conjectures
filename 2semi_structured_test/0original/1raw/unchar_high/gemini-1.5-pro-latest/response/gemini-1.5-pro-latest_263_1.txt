I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a wide range of professions and doesn't offer any specific traits that might be more common among computer science professors versus humanities professors. 
* **Base rate is crucial:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher starting probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor would be from computer science. However, the generic description doesn't give us any information to adjust this base rate.

**To improve the probability estimate, I would need more information that could potentially differentiate between the two groups of professors, such as:**

* Specific research interests
* Teaching style
* Hobbies outside of work
* Personality traits more unique to certain fields 

Without such information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the evidence provided.
