It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** The study includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This means a randomly selected professor is more likely to be from computer science simply due to the way the sample is structured. 

**To provide a probability, we would need more information that could potentially distinguish between computer science and humanities professors.** 

**Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful probability.**
