It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the description provided. The description highlights positive personal qualities and provides no information about Jason's work or interests that would hint at his field of study. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the sample.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Total professors:** 100
* **Computer science professors:** 75

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75
