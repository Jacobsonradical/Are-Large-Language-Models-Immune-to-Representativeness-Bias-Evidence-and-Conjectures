I cannot give you a probability because the provided description does not contain any information that is stereotypically associated with either computer science or humanities disciplines. 

The description focuses on Jason's personal attributes (age, marital status, personality) and professional reputation, which are not informative for determining his field of study. 

To provide a probability, I would need information that hints at specific research interests, teaching styles, or other aspects related to computer science or humanities.
