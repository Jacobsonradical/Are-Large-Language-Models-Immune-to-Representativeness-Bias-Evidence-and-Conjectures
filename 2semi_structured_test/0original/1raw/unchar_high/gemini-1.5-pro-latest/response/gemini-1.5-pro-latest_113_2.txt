It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or have particular personality traits is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence.  
* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in many fields.  

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I am providing 0.5 as the probability because, with no useful information, the chances are 50/50. However, it's crucial to understand this is not a calculated or meaningful probability.
