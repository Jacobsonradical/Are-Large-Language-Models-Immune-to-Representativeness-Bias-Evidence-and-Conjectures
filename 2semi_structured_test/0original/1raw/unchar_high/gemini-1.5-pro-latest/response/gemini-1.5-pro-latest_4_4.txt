I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science.  It lacks any specific details about his research, interests, or teaching style that might hint at his field.
* **Base rate is crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.  This means there's a higher starting probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (75%). 
* **No correlation implied:** The study doesn't suggest that the provided personality description is more common among computer science professors or humanities professors.

**To get a more accurate probability, I would need more information that relates specifically to the traits of professors in each field as identified by the study.**
