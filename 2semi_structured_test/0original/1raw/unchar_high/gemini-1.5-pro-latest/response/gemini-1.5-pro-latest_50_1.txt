It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is dangerous:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is biased and inaccurate.  Humanities professors can have these traits too.
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were subtle trends within the study's data, a sample size of 100 is relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about entire professions. 
* **Lack of comparative information:**  The description doesn't tell us how common or uncommon Jason's traits were within each group of professors. 

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "0.5"} 

While I'm providing 0.5 to represent an equal chance, it's crucial to understand that this does **not** reflect a true probability based on the given information.
