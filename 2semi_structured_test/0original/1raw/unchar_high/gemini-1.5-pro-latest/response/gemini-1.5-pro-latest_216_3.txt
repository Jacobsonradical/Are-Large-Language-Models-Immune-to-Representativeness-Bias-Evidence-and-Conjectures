It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in any field.  

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
