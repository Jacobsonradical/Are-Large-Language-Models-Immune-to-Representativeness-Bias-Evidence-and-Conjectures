I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description of Jason is generic and could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no details that hint at a specific field of study. 
* **Base Rate is Crucial:**  To estimate probability, we need to consider the base rate (prior probability).  We know there's a higher chance (75/100) of a randomly chosen professor in the study being in computer science. However, without any information linking Jason's description to computer science specifically, we cannot adjust this base rate.

**In short, the description of Jason is insufficient to determine a probability different from the base rate. **
