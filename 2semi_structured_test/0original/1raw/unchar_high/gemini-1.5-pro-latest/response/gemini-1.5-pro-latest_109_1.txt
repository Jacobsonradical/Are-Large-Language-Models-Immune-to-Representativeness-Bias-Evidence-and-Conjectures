It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any specific information related to computer science or humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science. This translates to a 75% probability. 
* **Lack of Diagnostic Information:**  The description doesn't offer any clues that would increase or decrease the likelihood of Jason being in computer science vs. humanities.  

**Important Note:**  We are avoiding the "base rate fallacy" by acknowledging that the description provides no specific evidence to shift our assessment away from the original proportion of computer science professors in the study.
