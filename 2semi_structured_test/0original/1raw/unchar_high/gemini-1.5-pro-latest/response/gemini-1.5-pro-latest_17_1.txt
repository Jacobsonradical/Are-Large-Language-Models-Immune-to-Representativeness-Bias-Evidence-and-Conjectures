It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Limited Information:** The description offers general traits that could apply to successful individuals in various fields. 
* **Sample Bias:** Even knowing the study's sample size (75 computer science vs. 25 humanities), we can't extrapolate to a single individual without more information specific to Jason's work and personality.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This reflects the base rate in the study, **not** any information about Jason himself.
