It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given, such as his age, marital status, personality traits, and professional standing, are stereotypical and could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are computer science professors (75%).  We lack any information about Jason that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor than any other randomly selected professor in the study.
