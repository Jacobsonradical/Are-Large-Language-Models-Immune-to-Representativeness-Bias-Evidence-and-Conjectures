I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the given description. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description focuses on general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. There's no mention of specific interests, hobbies, or work styles that might hint at a computer science background.
* **Bias in the Sample:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means the initial probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is already higher (75%).  Simply stating Jason is "successful" doesn't overcome that initial bias.

**To make a more informed probability estimate, I would need additional information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors within the context of this study.**
