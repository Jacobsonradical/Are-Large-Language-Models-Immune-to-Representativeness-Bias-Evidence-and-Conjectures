It is impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. The description focuses on general personality traits and circumstances that are not specific to computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age and marital status:** These factors are not indicative of a particular academic field.
* **High ability and motivation:** These are desirable traits in any academic discipline.
* **Positive reputation:** This also holds true for both computer science and humanities professors. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, there is a 75% chance that Jason is one of them based solely on the composition of the sample.
