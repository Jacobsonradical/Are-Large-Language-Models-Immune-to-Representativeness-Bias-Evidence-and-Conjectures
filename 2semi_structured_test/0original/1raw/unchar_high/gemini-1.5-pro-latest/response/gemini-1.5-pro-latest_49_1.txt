It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to individuals in both computer science and humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information linking the description to either field, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
