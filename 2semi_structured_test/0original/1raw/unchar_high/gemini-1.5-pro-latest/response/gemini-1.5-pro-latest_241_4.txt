It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer science professors versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and unhelpful. 
* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive qualities (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just academia.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 75/100 = 0.75.
