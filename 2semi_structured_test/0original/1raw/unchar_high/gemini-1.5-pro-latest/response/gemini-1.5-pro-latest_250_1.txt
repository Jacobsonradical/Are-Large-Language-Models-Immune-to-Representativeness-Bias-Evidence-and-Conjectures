It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate provided in the study description. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **75 out of 100** professors in the study are in computer science.
* This translates to a **75% probability**.

**Answer:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
