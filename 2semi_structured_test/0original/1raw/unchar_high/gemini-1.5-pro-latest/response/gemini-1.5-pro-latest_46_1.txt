I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could easily apply to successful professors in both computer science and the humanities.  
* **No comparative information:**  The description doesn't tell us how Jason's personality might differ from other professors in the study, making it impossible to assess his likelihood of being in either group.

To estimate the probability, I would need information that helps distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors based on their personality traits.
