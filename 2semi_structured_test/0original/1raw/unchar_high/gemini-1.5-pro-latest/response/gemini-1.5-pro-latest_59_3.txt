It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:**  While we might have cultural stereotypes about computer science professors versus humanities professors, these stereotypes are unreliable and often inaccurate. 
* **The description is generic:** The description of Jason focuses on positive personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just academia. 
* **No relevant information:**  The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research, teaching style, interests, or other factors that might hint at his field of study.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any of the professors in the sample being a computer science professor, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**
