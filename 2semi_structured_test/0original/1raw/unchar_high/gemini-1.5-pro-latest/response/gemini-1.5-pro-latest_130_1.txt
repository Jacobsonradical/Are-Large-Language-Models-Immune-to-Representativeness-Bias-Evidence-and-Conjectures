I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Description is too general:** The description of Jason is very generic. It lacks any specific details that might hint at a particular academic field like computer science (e.g., hobbies, interests, communication style). 
* **Base rate is crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know that 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science. This means there's a higher starting probability (75%) that Jason is a computer science professor. However, without any field-specific information in the description, relying solely on the base rate would be a fallacy. 

**To improve the probability estimation, we would need more information about Jason that relates to the stereotypes or typical characteristics of people in computer science vs. humanities.**
