It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:**  It lacks any information specifically related to personality traits common in either computer science or humanities.  Many professions value high ability, strong motivation, and positive interpersonal skills. 
* **The sample sizes are potentially biasing:** With 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a higher baseline chance of any random professor being in computer science.

**To provide a meaningful probability, we would need information about how the described traits correlate (or not) with either field.** 

**Therefore, I cannot give you a probability other than a guess.**
