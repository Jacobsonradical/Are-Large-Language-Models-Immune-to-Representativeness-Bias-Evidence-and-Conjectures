It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes generic positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 
 
This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
