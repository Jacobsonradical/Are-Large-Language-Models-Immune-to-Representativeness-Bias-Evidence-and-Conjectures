It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general positive personality traits and life circumstances that could apply to a professor in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence. 
* **Description is vague:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field of study.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
