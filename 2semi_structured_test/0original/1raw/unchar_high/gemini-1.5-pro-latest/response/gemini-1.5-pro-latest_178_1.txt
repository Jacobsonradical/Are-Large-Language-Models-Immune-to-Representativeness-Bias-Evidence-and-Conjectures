It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the provided description. Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked). These traits could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science.
* **Small sample size and potential bias:** The study has a relatively small sample size and focuses only on tenured professors. This might not be representative of all computer science or humanities professionals.

**Therefore, without more information relevant to the specific demands and characteristics of computer science versus humanities, any probability assignment would be arbitrary.**

**{"probability": "0.5"}** 

I'm providing 0.5 as a probability because, in the absence of any distinguishing information, we must assume an equal chance of Jason being in either field (50% computer science, 50% humanities).
