It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies equally to professionals in computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability is equal to the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.  Without any distinguishing information about Jason, the probability he's in computer science is the same as the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.
