It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at one field over the other. 
* **We lack relevant statistics:**  While we know the study size (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), this information alone doesn't tell us how common the described traits are within each field.

To make a more informed estimate, we would need additional information, such as:

* **Base rates:** How common are these traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) among professors in general, and are they more prevalent in one field over the other?
* **Predictive value of the description:** Does the description differentiate between computer science and humanities professors in any meaningful way? 

**Therefore, any probability estimate would be purely speculative.**
