It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No comparative information:**  We lack information on how these traits manifest differently between computer science and humanities professors.  
* **Small sample size:** Even knowing the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the sample size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about personality traits being predictive of a specific field.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
