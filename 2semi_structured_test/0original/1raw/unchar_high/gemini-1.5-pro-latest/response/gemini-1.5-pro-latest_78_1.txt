I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Description Lacks Relevant Information:** The description focuses on Jason's personal life (age, marital status) and general positive qualities (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked).  None of these traits are particularly indicative of being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
* **Stereotyping is Unhelpful:** It's tempting to make assumptions (e.g., maybe you think computer scientists are more likely to be married young), but these are stereotypes and not reliable for judging an individual case.
* **Base Rate is Crucial:** To calculate a meaningful probability, we need the base rate.  This means knowing how likely a randomly chosen professor from the study is to be a computer science professor *before* considering the description.  We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the base rate 75/100 = 0.75 or 75%. However, the description doesn't give us any information to adjust that base rate.

**In short:**  Without more information that specifically relates to the fields of computer science or humanities, any probability estimate would be a guess.
