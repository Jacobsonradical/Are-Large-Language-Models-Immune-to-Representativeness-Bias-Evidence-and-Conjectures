It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given is stereotypical and doesn't offer any specific insights into whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality traits are not exclusive to fields:**  Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are found in successful individuals across all disciplines. 
* **The description is vague:**  It lacks specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science (75%).  Without more information, we have no reason to assume Jason is any more or less likely to be one of them.
