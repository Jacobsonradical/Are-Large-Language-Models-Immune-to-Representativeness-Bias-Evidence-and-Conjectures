It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While we might have preconceived notions about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just academia. 
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** Knowing the study's sample size doesn't provide any specific insights into Jason's field.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
