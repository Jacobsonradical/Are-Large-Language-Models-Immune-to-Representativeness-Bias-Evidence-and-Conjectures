It is impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in any field, not just computer science. 
* **No comparative information:** We lack information about the typical personality profiles of professors in computer science versus humanities.  

Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess and not based on the available data. 

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined from the information given"}**
