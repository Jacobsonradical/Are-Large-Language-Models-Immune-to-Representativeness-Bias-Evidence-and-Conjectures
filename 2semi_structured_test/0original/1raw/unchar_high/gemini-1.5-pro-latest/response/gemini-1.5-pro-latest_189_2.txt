It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  The traits mentioned (high ability, motivation, positive reputation) are desirable in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **The sample size is small:** While there were more computer science professors in the study, this doesn't automatically make Jason more likely to be one.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"}
