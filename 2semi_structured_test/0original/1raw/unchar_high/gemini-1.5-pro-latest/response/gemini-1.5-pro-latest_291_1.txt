It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, married without children, or have certain personality traits is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Small sample size:**  The study only includes 100 professors, which is a small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

{"probability": "0.75"}
