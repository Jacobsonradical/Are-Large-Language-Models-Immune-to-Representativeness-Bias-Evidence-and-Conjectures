It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:** Being 30 years old, married, and without children doesn't strongly indicate either computer science or humanities.
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are desirable for success in any academic field.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  These social aspects are also beneficial across disciplines. 

**Therefore, without any information linking Jason's description to computer science specifically, the probability is based solely on the initial sample proportions.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
