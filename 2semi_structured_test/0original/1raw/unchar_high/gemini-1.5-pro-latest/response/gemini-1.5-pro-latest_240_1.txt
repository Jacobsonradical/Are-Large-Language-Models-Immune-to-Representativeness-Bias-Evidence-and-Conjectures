It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits, and professional standing) is stereotypical and could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the base rate of computer science professors in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, making the prior probability 75%. Without any distinguishing information about Jason related to his field, we cannot deviate from this base rate.
