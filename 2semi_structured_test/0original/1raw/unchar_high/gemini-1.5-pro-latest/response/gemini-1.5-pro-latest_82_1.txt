It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.  Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
