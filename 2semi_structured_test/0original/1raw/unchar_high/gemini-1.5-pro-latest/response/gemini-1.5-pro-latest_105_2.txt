It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given focuses on his personal qualities and professional standing, which are not necessarily indicative of being a computer science professor. 

Here's why:

* **Personality traits are not exclusive to one profession:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are valuable traits across many professions, not just computer science. 
* **The description lacks specific clues:** There's nothing in the description about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that would hint towards computer science or humanities.

Since we have no information to differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, the probability is equal for both. 

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.5"} 
```
