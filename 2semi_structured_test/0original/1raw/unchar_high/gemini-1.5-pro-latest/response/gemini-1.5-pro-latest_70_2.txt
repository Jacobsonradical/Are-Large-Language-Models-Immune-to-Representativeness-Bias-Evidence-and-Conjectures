It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description lacks specific clues:**  The description offers no information about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100.
* The probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
