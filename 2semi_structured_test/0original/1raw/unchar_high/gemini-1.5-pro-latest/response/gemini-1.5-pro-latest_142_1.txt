It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample from which to draw conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of Field-Specific Information:**  The description lacks any details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
