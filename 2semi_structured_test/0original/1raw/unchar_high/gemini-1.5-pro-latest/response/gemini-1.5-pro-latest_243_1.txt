It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, 100 people is not a large enough sample to draw conclusions about entire professions.
* **Lack of comparative information:**  We don't know how the humanities professors were described.  Maybe they were described with similar traits.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"} 
 
I'm providing 0.5 as the probability, but understand this represents a 50/50 chance, essentially a coin flip, as there's no valid basis to favor one field over the other.
