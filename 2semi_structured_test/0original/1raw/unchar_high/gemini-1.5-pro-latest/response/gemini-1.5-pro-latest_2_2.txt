I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. There are no specific details about his research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.
* **Base rate is crucial:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate â€“ the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample (75 out of 100). However, the description doesn't give us any information to adjust our estimate from this base rate.

**To illustrate:** If the description was highly stereotypical of a computer science professor (e.g., mentioning a love for coding, solitary hobbies), the probability would be higher than the base rate. Conversely, if the description fit a stereotypical humanities professor (e.g., mentioning a passion for literature, strong social skills), the probability would be lower than the base rate.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability estimate would be a guess.**
