It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:**  The study includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This means a randomly chosen professor is more likely to be from computer science simply due to the composition of the study.

**To calculate the probability, we would need information that hints at specific skills or interests related to computer science or humanities within Jason's profile.**

**Therefore, without further information, any probability assigned would be a guess.**
