I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the given information. 

Here's why:

* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description of Jason is very generic. It highlights positive qualities (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science. 
* **No Comparative Information:** The description doesn't offer any traits or experiences that are more typical of computer science professors versus humanities professors. 
* **Sample Bias:** We don't know if the initial sample of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors accurately reflects the actual proportion of these professors in the wider academic population.

**To provide a meaningful probability, I would need information that helps distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, such as:**

* Specific research interests
* Teaching style
* Collaboration preferences
* Technological proficiency 

Without such differentiating factors, any probability estimate would be arbitrary.
