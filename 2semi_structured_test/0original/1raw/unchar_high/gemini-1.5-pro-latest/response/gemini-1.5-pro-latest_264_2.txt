It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the provided description.  The information given is too general and doesn't offer any insight into his academic interests or career path. 

Here's why:

* **Personality is not field-specific:**  While there might be some personality trends within different professions, they are not definitive.  Many personality traits like high motivation, intelligence, and being well-liked are found across successful individuals in various fields.
* **The description is vague:** The information about Jason is very general. It doesn't mention anything about his research, teaching style, interests, or anything else that could hint at his academic background.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as him being in the humanities, which is equivalent to the initial proportions given in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, there's a 75% chance that Jason belongs to that group based purely on the sample composition.
