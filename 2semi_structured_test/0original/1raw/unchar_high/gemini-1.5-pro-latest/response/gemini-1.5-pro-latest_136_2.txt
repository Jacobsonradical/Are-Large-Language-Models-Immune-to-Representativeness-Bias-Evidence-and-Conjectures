It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate provided in the study's sample. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **75 out of 100** professors in the study are in computer science.
* This translates to a **0.75** probability.

Therefore:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
