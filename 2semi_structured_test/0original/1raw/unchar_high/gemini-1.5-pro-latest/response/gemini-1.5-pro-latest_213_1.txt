I cannot determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks specific information:** The description highlights general traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked. These traits can be found in successful individuals across various fields, not just computer science. 
* **The description doesn't mention research or teaching style:**  Insights into Jason's research interests, teaching methodologies, or preferred areas of focus would have been helpful in determining his field.

Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.
