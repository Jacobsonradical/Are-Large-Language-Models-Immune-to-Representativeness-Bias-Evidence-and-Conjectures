It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given is too general and does not contain any specific clues about whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  While stereotypes exist about personality differences between fields, they are unreliable for predicting an individual's profession. The description highlights positive qualities that could be found in professors from any discipline.
* **Demographics:** The information about Jason's age, marital status, and children is not relevant in determining his field of study.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from any field. Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, Jason has a 75/100 chance of being in computer science.
