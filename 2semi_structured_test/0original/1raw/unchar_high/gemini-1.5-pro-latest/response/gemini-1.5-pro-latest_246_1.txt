It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides generic positive attributes applicable to successful individuals in many professions.  

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:**  Being 30, married, and childless doesn't strongly correlate with either computer science or humanities. 
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These are desirable traits in academia and many other fields.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:** This speaks to interpersonal skills, again valuable across disciplines.

**Without any information linking the described traits to computer science specifically, assuming he is more likely to be in computer science simply because that group is larger in the study would be baseless.**

Therefore, the probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:
