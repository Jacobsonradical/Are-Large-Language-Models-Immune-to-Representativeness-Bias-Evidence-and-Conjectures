It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:** It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:**  There's nothing about Jason's interests, research, teaching style, or any other clue that would link him to computer science or humanities.
* **Base rate bias:** We know the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.  This difference in base rates might tempt you to guess a higher probability for computer science, but that would be ignoring the lack of information in the description itself.

**Therefore, any probability estimate would be pure speculation.**
