It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. There is no mention of teaching style, research interests, or any other clues related to his academic field. 
* **Base rate bias:** We need to consider the base rates. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher prior probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor from this study would be from computer science.

**Therefore, any probability estimate would be based on pure speculation.**  

While it's tempting to lean towards a higher probability because of the base rate, it would be statistically unjustified without any evidence from the description to differentiate Jason's field of expertise.
