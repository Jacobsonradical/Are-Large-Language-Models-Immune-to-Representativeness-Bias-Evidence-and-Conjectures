It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:**  We have no information about the personality descriptions of other professors in the study, making it impossible to assess if Jason's profile is more typical of computer science or humanities professors.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and not based on the given information.**
