It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to computer science or humanities:** The information about Jason's age, marital status, personality, and reputation doesn't correlate strongly with either field. 
* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** While we might have stereotypes about academics in different fields, relying on them would be inaccurate and potentially biased.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science, making the base probability 75%.
