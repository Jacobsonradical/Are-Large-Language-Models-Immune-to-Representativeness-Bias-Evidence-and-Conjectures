It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies equally to professors in computer science and the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, male, or lacking children is based on stereotypes, not reality.
* **Description is generic:** The description emphasizes positive qualities found in many successful professionals, regardless of their field.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities.
