It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could be found in successful academics in any field. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:** Being 30, married, and without children is not specific to computer science or humanities.
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are desirable in any academic discipline.
* **Well-liked and Positive Reputation:**  This suggests good interpersonal skills, valuable in both fields.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, making the probability 75/100 = 0.75.
