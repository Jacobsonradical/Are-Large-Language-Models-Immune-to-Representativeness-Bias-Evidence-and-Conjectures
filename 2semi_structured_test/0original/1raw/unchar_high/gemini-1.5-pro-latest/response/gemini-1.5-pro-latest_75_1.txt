It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general traits and circumstances applicable to professors in both fields. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is a plausible age for a tenured professor in both computer science and humanities.
* **Marital Status:**  Being married with or without children is common in both fields.
* **Personality:**  High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are desirable traits in any academic discipline.

**Therefore, without further information that could hint at a specific field (research interests, hobbies, etc.), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
