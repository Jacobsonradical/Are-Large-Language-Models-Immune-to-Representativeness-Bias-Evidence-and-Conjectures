It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children by age 30, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence.
* **The description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in *any* field. It lacks specific details about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his academic discipline. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group. Since the sample size is 100 with 75 computer science professors, the probability is:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
