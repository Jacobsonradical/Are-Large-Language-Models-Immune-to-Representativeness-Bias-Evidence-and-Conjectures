It's impossible to determine Jason's field solely based on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be young, male, married without children, highly motivated, or well-liked is relying on stereotypes. These traits can be found in successful individuals across many professions. 
* **Limited information:** The description offers no specific clues related to Jason's research, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
