It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks subject-specific information:** It focuses on general personality traits and social skills applicable to various professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is small:**  While there might be personality trends within larger groups of academics, a sample of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors is not enough to draw definitive conclusions.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
