It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes positive personal and professional qualities that could apply to a professor in either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:** The description highlights Jason's ability, motivation, and positive reputation, which are desirable traits in many professions, not just specific to computer science or humanities. 
* **Demographics:**  While age and marital status are mentioned, they don't offer any statistically significant correlation with either field. 

Therefore, without further information about Jason's research, teaching style, or other relevant factors, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"}
