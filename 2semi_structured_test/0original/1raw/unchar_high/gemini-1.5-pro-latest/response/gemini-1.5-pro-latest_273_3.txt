It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study as humanities professors. However, this prior information is not relevant in light of the completely non-informative description.

**Therefore, without further information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

While it's tempting to factor in the higher number of computer science professors, doing so would be statistically flawed. We are given no information about Jason that is more likely to be associated with either field.

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"}
