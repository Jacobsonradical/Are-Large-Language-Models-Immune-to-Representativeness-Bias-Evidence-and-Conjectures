It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given reveals nothing about his research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his profession. 

Here's why:

* **Personality Traits Aren't Field-Specific:**  Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are valuable in numerous professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **Description is Generic:** The description is quite general and could apply to many individuals in various academic fields.
* **Sample Size is Irrelevant:**  While the study's sample size is mentioned, it doesn't provide any useful information for determining Jason's specific field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.  Therefore, there's a 75% chance that any randomly selected professor from this study, including Jason, is a computer science professor.
