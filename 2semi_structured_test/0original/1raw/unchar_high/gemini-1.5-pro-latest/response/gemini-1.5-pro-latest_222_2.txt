It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to the academic field.**  It highlights general traits like motivation, likability, and marital status, which are not specific to computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample sizes are skewed.** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means there's a higher chance of randomly selecting a computer science professor overall, the description itself doesn't offer any clues to differentiate between the two fields.

**Therefore, without more information directly linking Jason's personality or background to computer science, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
