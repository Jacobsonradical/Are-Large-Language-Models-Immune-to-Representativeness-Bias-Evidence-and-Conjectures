It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  It highlights general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this influences the overall probability, it doesn't tell us anything specific about Jason.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
