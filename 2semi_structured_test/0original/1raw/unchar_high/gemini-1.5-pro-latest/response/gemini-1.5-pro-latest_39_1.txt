I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science. There is no information specific enough to indicate a leaning towards one field or the other.
* **Base rates are crucial:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rates. We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher starting chance (75%) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science. However, without any information linking the description to specific traits of computer science professors, the base rate alone isn't enough.

**To give you a meaningful probability, I would need more information that correlates with personality traits or characteristics more common among computer science professors versus humanities professors.**
