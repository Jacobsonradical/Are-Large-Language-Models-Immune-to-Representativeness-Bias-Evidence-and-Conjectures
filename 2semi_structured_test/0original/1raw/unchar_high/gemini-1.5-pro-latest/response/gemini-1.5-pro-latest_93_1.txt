It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science.  
* **Small Sample Size:** 100 people is a relatively small sample size, and assuming this description makes someone more likely to be in one field over another is statistically weak. 
* **Lack of Field-Specific Information:**  The description lacks any details about Jason's research, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science, there's a 75% chance that Jason, randomly chosen from this group, is one of them.
