It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits and demographics that could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Therefore, given the lack of information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, totaling 100.
* The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is  75/100 = 0.75.
