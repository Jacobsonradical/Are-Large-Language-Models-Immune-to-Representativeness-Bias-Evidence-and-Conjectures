It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information given. The description provided focuses on general personality traits and circumstances that are not specific to either computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:** Being 30 years old, married, and without children is not indicative of either field.
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are desirable in many professions, not just academia, and within academia, they are valuable in both computer science and the humanities.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  Similar to the point above, these traits are beneficial in numerous fields and don't point towards a specific academic discipline. 

Since we have no information about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests, we have to rely on the base rate provided in the study.  75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
