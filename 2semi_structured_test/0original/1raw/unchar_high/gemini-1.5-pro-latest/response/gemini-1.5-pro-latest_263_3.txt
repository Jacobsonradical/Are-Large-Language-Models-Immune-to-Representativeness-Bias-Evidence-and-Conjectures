It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **Description lacks specifics:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just academia. There's no mention of specific research interests, teaching styles, or other clues that might hint at Jason's field.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This reflects that 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
