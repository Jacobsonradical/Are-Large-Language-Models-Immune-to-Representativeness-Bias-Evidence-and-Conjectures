It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are not exclusive to computer science. Successful academics in any field likely share these characteristics.
* **Demographics:** The information about Jason's age, marital status, and lack of children is irrelevant in predicting his field of study.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
