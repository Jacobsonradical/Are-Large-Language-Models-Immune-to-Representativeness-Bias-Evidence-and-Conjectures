It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information given. The description provided offers generic details applicable to successful professionals in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:** Being 30, married, and childless is not specific to computer science or humanities professors. 
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These traits are desirable in academia as a whole, not exclusive to one field.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  Similar to the above, these are positive qualities found in successful individuals across disciplines.

Therefore, without further information directly related to Jason's research, teaching, or interests, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.
