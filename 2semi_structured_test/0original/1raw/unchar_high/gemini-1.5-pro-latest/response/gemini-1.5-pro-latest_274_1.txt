It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While there might be stereotypical images of computer science professors versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and unhelpful. 
* **The description is generic:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just academia. There's no information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
