It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It describes traits that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **Bias alert:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  or that they are less likely to have children at 30,  introduces harmful stereotypes.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 75/100 = 0.75.
