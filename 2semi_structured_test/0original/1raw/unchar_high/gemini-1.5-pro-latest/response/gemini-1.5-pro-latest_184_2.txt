It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given, such as age, marital status, personality traits, and professional standing, are stereotypical and do not inherently correlate with a specific academic discipline. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the sample.

**Answer:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, there's a 75% chance that Jason belongs to that group, assuming no other information is available.
