It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are not reliable:** While there might be stereotypical images of computer scientists and humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and unhelpful. 
* **The description is generic:** The provided information about Jason (age, marital status, work ethic, likability) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just academia. 

**Therefore, without any information linking the described traits to either computer science or humanities, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I am providing 0.5 as the probability because, in the absence of any other information, the base rate (50% chance of being in either group) is the most logical assumption. However, it's crucial to understand this does not reflect a genuine probability based on the given information.
