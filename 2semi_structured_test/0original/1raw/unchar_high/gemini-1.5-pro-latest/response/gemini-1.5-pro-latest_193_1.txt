I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a probability estimate for this scenario. The description provided offers no information about Jason's field of study or any traits that would be particularly indicative of being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. 

Here's why:

* **Description Bias:** The description focuses on positive personality traits and general life circumstances common across many professions, not just academia. 
* **Lack of Field-Specific Information:** There are no details about Jason's research, teaching style, interests, or any other clues that might hint at his academic discipline.

To give you a meaningful probability, I would need more information that is relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.
