It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is harmful:** Assuming computer science professors share certain personality traits while humanities professors have others is simply perpetuating stereotypes. 
* **Description is generic:**  The description provided could easily apply to a successful individual in many professions, not just academia. 
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw broad conclusions.

**Therefore, without any information linking the description to specific traits found more commonly in either field, the probability is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**
