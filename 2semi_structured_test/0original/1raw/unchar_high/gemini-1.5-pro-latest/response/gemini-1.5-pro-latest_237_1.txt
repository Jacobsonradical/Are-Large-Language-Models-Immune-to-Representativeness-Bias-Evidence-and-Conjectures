I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the given description. Here's why:

* **Lack of Relevant Information:** The description provides common biographical details and positive personality traits.  There is no information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, hobbies, or any other factors that might be stereotypically associated (rightly or wrongly) with computer science or humanities professors. 
* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:** Even if the description included details that align with stereotypes (e.g., "enjoys logic puzzles" or "loves classic literature"), relying on stereotypes would be inaccurate and potentially biased. 
* **Prior Probabilities Matter:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the prior probabilities. Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a higher starting chance (75%) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. However, without any distinguishing information about Jason, we can't deviate from this baseline.

**In conclusion, any probability estimate beyond the baseline 0.75 (reflecting the sample composition) would be pure speculation.**
