I'm sorry, I cannot answer this question with the information provided. The description provided for Jason lacks any information about his personality traits or other characteristics that would provide a basis for determining whether he's more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.  

To make an informed estimate, I would need information about how certain personality traits correlate with either field based on the study's findings.
