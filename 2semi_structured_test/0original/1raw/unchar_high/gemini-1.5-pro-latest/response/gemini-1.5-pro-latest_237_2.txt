It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and unhelpful. 
* **Description is generic:** The description of Jason is very general and could apply to a successful individual in many professions, not just academia. 
* **Sample size is irrelevant:**  Knowing the sample size of the original study doesn't provide any specific information about Jason's likelihood of being in one field or the other.

**Therefore, I cannot give you a probability.**  The information provided does not offer any insight into Jason's field of study.
