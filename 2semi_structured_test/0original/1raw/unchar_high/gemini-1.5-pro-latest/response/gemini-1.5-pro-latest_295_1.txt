I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:** The personality description of Jason is very generic and could apply to a successful professor in any field, not just computer science. 
* **No relevant information about personality:** The description doesn't highlight any specific personality traits that are known to be more common in either computer science or humanities professors. 
* **Base rate bias:** While we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, this information alone isn't enough. To make an accurate probability judgment, we would need to know if there are specific personality traits that significantly differentiate the two groups, as identified by the study.

**In short, the information provided doesn't give any insight into whether Jason's personality is more aligned with a computer science or humanities professor.**
