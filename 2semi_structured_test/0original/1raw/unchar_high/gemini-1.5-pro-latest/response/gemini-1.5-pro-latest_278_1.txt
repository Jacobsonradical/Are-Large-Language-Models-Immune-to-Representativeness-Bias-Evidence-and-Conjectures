It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science.
* **The sample size is small:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw strong conclusions about entire fields. 
* **Base rates matter:**  There are likely more computer science professors overall compared to humanities professors. This "base rate" information would be crucial in determining a more accurate probability.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**
