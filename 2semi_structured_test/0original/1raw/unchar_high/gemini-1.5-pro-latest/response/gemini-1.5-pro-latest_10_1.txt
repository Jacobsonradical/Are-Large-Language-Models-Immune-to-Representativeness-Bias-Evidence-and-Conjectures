It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too general:**  It describes traits common to many successful professionals, regardless of their field (high ability, strong motivation, good reputation).
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at computer science or humanities.
* **Bias alert:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married, or childless at 30 would be stereotyping. 

**Therefore, the probability is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**
