It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks subject-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common across professions.  There are no details related to teaching style, research interests, or other clues that might hint at Jason's field.
* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married, or have certain personality traits is based on stereotypes and not factual evidence. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science. This means there's a 75% chance that any randomly chosen professor from the group, including Jason, is a computer science professor.
