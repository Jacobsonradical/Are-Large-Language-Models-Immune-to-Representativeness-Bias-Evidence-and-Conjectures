It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general positive attributes but nothing specifically related to computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Demographics are unhelpful:**  The description mentions age, marital status, and a positive work reputation. These traits are found across professions and don't favor computer science or humanities.
* **No field-specific clues:** There's no mention of Jason's interests, teaching style, research, or any other clue that might hint at his academic field.

Since we have no useful information to differentiate, the probability is based solely on the initial sample composition:

* **75 Computer Science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75**

**Therefore:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
