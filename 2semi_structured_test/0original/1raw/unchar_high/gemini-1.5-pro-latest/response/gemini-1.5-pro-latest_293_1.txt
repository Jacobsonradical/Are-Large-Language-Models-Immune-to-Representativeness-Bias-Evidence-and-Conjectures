It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. 

The description highlights traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," being "well-liked," and having a "positive reputation."  These traits are not exclusive to computer science and could easily apply to successful professors in the humanities as well.  

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
* This means 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
*  The probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
