I cannot answer this question without further information or context that would suggest a correlation between the provided description and the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor. The description offers general personality traits and demographics that are not stereotypically exclusive to either computer science or humanities disciplines.  

To provide a probability, I would need some evidence suggesting:

* **Are there personality traits more common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors?**  The prompt mentions "common personality traits among successful academics" but doesn't specify if these traits differ between the two fields.
* **Is age, marital status, or having children relevant to the field of study?** The description provides these details about Jason, but it's unclear if they hold any significance in this context. 

Therefore, any probability I provide would be a random guess without any supporting evidence.
