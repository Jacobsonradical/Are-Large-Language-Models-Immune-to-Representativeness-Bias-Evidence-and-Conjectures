It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be found in professors of any discipline. 

Since we know 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, there's a higher baseline probability he belongs to that group. However, the description doesn't offer any specific clues to confirm or deny that. 

Therefore, the probability remains the same as the sample distribution:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```
