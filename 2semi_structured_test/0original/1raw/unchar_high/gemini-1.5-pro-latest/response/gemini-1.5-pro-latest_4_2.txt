I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in almost any field. There are no details that specifically relate to computer science or the humanities. 
* **Base rate neglect:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rates. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher starting probability that a randomly chosen professor would be from computer science. However, the generic description provides no information to adjust that probability.

**To get a more accurate probability, we would need more information in the description that is specifically relevant to the differences between computer science and humanities professors.**
