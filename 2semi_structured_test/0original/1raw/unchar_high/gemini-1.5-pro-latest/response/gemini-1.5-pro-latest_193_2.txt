It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 is a plausible age for a tenured professor in both computer science and humanities. 
* **Marital Status:** Being married with or without children is not indicative of a specific academic field.
* **Personality:** High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are desirable traits in many professions, not just academia.

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
