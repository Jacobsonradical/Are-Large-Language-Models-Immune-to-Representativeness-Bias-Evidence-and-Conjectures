It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could easily apply to successful professors in any field, not just computer science.
* **No comparative information:** We don't know if these traits were more or less common among the computer science professors versus the humanities professors. 

**To calculate a meaningful probability, we would need more information, such as:**

* **Base rates:**  What percentage of the overall sample were computer science professors? (In this case, it's 75 out of 100, or 75%.)
* **Correlations:** Did the study find any personality traits that were significantly more prevalent among computer science professors compared to humanities professors?

**Without this additional information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary and unfounded.**

Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate in the requested format.
