I cannot give a reliable probability estimate based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to many successful professionals, regardless of their field. There's nothing specifically indicative of a computer science background.
* **Base rates are crucial:** To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study. This means there's a higher starting probability (75%) that a randomly chosen professor would be from computer science. However, the generic description doesn't give us any information to adjust this base rate.

**To improve the probability estimate, I would need more information that is specifically relevant to distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors.**
