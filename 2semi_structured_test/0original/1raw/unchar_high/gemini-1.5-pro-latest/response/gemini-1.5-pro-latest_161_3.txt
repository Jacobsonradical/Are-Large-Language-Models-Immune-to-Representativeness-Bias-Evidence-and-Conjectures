It's impossible to determine the probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no details that particularly hint at one field over the other. 
* **We lack relevant information:**  To make an informed guess, we'd need some indication that certain personality traits are more common in one field versus the other.  Does the study suggest computer science professors are more likely to be married young? Are humanities professors more likely to be described as "well-liked"? Without this kind of information, any probability assigned is a pure guess.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful probability estimate.**
