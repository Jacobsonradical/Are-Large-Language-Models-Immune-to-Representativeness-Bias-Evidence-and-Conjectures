It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Personality Traits:** The description highlights Jason's intelligence, motivation, and positive relationships with colleagues. These traits are valuable in many professions, not just computer science. 
* **Lack of Field-Specific Information:**  There are no clues about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other indicator that would link him to computer science or humanities.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
