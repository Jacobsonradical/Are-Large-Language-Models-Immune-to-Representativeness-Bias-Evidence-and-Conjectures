It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could be found in successful academics of any field. 

Here's why:

* **Age and Family Status:**  Being 30, married, and without children doesn't indicate a specific field.
* **High Ability and Motivation:** These are desirable traits in many professions, especially academia.
* **Well-Liked and Positive Reputation:**  This speaks to interpersonal skills, again not specific to any one field.

Since we have no information about Jason's research, teaching style, or other clues related to his academic field, we have to rely on the base rates provided in the study. 

* **75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.** This means there's a 75% chance a randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the overall proportion in the study:
