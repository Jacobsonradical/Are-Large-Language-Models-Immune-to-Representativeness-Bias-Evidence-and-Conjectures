It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  While we might have preconceived notions about the personality traits of professors in different fields, these stereotypes are often inaccurate and should not be used for this type of judgment.
* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive qualities (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could be found in successful individuals across various professions. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
