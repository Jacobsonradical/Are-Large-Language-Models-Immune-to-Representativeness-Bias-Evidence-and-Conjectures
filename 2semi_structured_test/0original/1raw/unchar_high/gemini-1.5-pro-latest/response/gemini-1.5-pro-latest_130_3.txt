It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the information given. The description focuses on general personality traits and doesn't offer any clues about his academic specialization. 

Here's why this type of reasoning is problematic:

* **Stereotyping:**  Assuming computer science professors share specific personality traits is inaccurate and reinforces stereotypes. 
* **Lack of Evidence:** The description provides no information about Jason's research, teaching, or interests that would link him to either field.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the sample:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science.
