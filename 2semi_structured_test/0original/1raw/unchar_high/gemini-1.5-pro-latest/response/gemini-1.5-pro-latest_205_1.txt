It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions about entire professions.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.  Without more information, there's a 75% chance Jason is one of them.
