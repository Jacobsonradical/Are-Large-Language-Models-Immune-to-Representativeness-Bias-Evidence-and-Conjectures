It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits and life circumstances common across professions.  
* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** While there might be stereotypes about computer scientists vs. humanities professors, relying on them is biased and inaccurate. 

**Therefore, without more information related to Jason's work or interests, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**
