It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general positive traits and circumstances that could apply to professors in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence.
* **Description is vague:** The description lacks any specific details about Jason's research, interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field. 

Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.
