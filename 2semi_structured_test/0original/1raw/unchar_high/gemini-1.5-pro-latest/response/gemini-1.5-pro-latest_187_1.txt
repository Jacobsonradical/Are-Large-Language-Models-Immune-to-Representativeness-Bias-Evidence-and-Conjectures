It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general positive traits that could apply to professors in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality traits are not exclusive:**  While there might be some personality traits slightly more common in one field,  high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are valuable in both computer science and the humanities. 
* **The description is vague:** It lacks any specific details that might hint at Jason's area of expertise or interests.

Since we have no useful information to differentiate, we fall back on the base rates provided in the study's description:

* 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors in the study.
