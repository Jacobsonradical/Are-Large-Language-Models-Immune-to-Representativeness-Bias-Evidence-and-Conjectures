I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a successful professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details that hint at his field of study.
* **Base rate bias:**  We know that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of computer science professors in the sample. Simply guessing "more likely computer science" based on this bias would be flawed without any information specific to Jason. 

**To estimate a probability, I would need more information that could differentiate between professors in the two fields, such as:**

* Research interests
* Teaching style
* Hobbies 
* Other personality traits specifically linked to either field in the study 

**Without such information, any probability estimate would be a guess.**
