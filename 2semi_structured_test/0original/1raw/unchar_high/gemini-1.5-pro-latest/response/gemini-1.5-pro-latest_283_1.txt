I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Description Lacks Specificity:** The description of Jason is very generic. It mentions positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No Comparative Information:** We lack information about the personality traits of the humanities professors.  To assess the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, we'd need to know if the description somehow differentiates him from the typical humanities professor in the study.

**To improve the probability estimate, I would need:**

* **Distinguishing personality traits:**  Information about how computer science professors and humanities professors might differ in their personalities based on the study's findings.
* **More specific details about Jason:**  Additional information about Jason's research interests, hobbies, or other relevant factors that could provide clues about his field. 
 
**In short, without more information that reveals how personality traits might differentiate the two groups of professors, any probability estimate would be a guess.**
