It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and professional standing but lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors relevant to his academic field. 

Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors in the study.
* This means there is a 75/100 = 0.75 probability that any randomly chosen professor from this study belongs to the computer science department.
