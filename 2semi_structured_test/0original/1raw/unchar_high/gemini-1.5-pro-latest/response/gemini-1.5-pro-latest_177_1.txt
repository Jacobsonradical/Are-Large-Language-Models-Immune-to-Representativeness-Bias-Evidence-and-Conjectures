It's impossible to determine Jason's profession based on the description provided. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to a professor in either field. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are valuable in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **Demographics:**  Being 30, married, and childless is common among professionals in various fields, offering no specific clues.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group due to the lack of information. Since there's a 50/50 chance:**
