I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details about his research, teaching style, interests, or other factors that might hint at his field.
* **Base rate bias:** To make a reasonable probability judgment, we'd need to consider the base rate. Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, there's a higher baseline chance of Jason being in computer science (75%). However, the generic description doesn't give us any evidence to adjust our estimate from this base rate.

**To improve the probability estimate, you would need to provide more revealing information about Jason's personality or professional life.**
