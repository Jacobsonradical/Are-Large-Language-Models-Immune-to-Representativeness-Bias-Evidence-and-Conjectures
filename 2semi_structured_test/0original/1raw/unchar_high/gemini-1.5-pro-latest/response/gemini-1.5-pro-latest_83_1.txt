It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:**  There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints towards computer science or humanities.

**Therefore, without more information, any probability I assign would be a guess.**  

To illustrate, I could arbitrarily say:

```json
{"probability": "0.5"} 
```

But this implies a 50/50 chance, which is simply a reflection of the fact that there are two groups, not based on any actual evidence from the description. 

**To get a more meaningful probability, we would need more information about Jason that is relevant to distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors.**
