I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could easily apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities.  There are no specific details that hint at his field of study. 
* **Base rate is important:** To calculate a probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher starting probability that a randomly selected professor would be from computer science.  However, without any information linking Jason specifically to computer science, we can't adjust that probability.

**To get a more accurate probability, I would need information that relates to common personality traits or stereotypes associated with each field.**  For example, if the description mentioned Jason being particularly introverted or extroverted, or having certain hobbies, that might allow for a more informed guess.
