It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are desirable qualities found in successful individuals across various professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. While this means it's statistically more likely a random professor is from computer science, the description gives us no reason to assume Jason is more likely than any other professor in the sample.

Therefore, without any information linking Jason's traits to a specific field, the probability is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the original sample.
