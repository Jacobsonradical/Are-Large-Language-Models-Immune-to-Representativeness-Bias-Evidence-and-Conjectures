I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The provided description of Jason could easily apply to a successful professor in either computer science or the humanities. There are no specific details about his research interests, teaching style, or personality traits that are stereotypically associated with one field or the other. 
* **Base rate is crucial:**  To calculate the probability, we need to consider the base rate.  We know that 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science (75%). This prior information is crucial in determining the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor.  However, without any distinguishing information about Jason, we can't deviate from this base rate.

**In conclusion:**  With the information given, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor remains the same as the base rate:

{"probability": "0.75"}
