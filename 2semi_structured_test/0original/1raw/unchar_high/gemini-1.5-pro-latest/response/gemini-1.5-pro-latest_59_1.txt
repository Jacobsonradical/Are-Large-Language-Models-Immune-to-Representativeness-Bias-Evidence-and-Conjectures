I'm sorry, but I cannot answer this question. The provided description of Jason lacks any information about his personality traits, research interests, or any other factors that would be indicative of his field of study. 

To estimate the probability, I would need information related to how personality traits differ between computer science and humanities professors based on the study. 

For example, if the study found that computer science professors were more likely to be described as "analytical" or "detail-oriented," and the description of Jason included those traits, then I could estimate a higher probability of him being a computer science professor. 

Without such information, any probability I provide would be a random guess.
