It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. The description highlights positive personality traits and provides no information related to computer science or humanities. 

Here's why this makes it tricky:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason" or fit the description is stereotyping. 
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some subtle biases in the description, a sample size of 100 is too small to draw meaningful conclusions.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
