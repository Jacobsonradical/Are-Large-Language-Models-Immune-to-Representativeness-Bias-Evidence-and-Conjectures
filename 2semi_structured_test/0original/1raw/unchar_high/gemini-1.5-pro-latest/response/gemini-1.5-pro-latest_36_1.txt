I cannot determine Jason's field of study based on the information provided. The description is devoid of any details that might hint at whether he works in computer science or humanities.

Here's why:

* **Personality traits are not exclusive:** Traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are found in successful individuals across all fields, not just computer science.
* **Demographics are too general:**  Knowing Jason's age, marital status, and having no children doesn't correlate to either field.

To make an informed probability judgment, I'd need information more specific to either computer science or humanities, such as:

* **Research interests:**  Does Jason work on artificial intelligence, or 18th-century literature?
* **Teaching style:**  Does he favor practical coding exercises, or Socratic seminars?
* **Hobbies:**  Does he enjoy building computers, or attending theatre?

**Therefore, without further information, my probability estimate is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

This reflects the fact that 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
