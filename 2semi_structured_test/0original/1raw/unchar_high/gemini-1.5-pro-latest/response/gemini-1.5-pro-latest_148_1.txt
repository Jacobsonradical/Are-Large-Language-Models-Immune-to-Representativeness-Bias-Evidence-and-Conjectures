It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The provided personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing in the description to suggest Jason's area of expertise.  

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**Answer:**

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm defaulting to 0.5, representing a 50/50 chance, only because we have no information to skew the probability in either direction.
