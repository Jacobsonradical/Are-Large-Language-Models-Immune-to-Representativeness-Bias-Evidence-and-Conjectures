It's impossible to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No comparative information:** We lack information about the personality traits of the humanities professors in the study.  To make an informed guess, we would need to know how their descriptions compare to Jason's.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be pure speculation.**
