It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality) applies to successful individuals in many fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  Assuming computer scientists are more likely to be "highly motivated" or that humanities professors are less likely to be "well-liked" is biased and inaccurate.
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 100 is too small to draw reliable conclusions. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
