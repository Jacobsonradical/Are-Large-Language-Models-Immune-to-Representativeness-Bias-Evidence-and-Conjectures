It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, totaling 100.
* The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75 (favorable outcomes) divided by 100 (total possible outcomes).
