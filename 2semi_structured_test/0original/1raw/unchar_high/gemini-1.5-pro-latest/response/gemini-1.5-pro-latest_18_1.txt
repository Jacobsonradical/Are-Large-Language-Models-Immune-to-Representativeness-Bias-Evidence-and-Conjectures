It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. The information given (age, marital status, personality traits) applies equally to professors in both computer science and the humanities. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Rate:** 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
* **Lack of Distinguishing Information:** The description doesn't offer any clues that are stereotypically associated with either computer science or humanities professors. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid relying on stereotypes.  While there might be personality trends in certain fields, individual variation is significant.
