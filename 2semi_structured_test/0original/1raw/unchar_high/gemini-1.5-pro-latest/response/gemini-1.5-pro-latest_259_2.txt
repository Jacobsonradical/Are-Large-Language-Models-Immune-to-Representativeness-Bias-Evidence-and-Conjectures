It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The information given describes general traits that could apply to professors in various disciplines. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are not exclusive to computer science. Successful academics in any field often share these characteristics. 
* **Demographics:** Knowing Jason's age, marital status, and parental status doesn't provide insight into his academic field. 
* **Lack of Specific Information:** There's no mention of Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other clues that might hint at his field. 

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 50%, the same as it would be for any randomly chosen professor from the study.**
