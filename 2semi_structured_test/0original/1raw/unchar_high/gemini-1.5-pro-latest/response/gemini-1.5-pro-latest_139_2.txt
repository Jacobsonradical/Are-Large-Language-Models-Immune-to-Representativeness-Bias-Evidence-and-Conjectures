It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:**  It highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in numerous professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study as humanities professors.  

While this skews the overall odds, we don't have enough information about *Jason specifically* to say whether he's more likely to be in one group or the other. 

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability other than to say it's equally likely he is in either field (in the absence of other information).**
