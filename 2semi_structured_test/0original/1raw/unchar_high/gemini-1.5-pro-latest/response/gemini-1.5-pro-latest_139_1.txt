It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits are not exclusive to computer science and can be found in successful individuals across various fields, including the humanities.
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study's sample size of 100 professors is relatively small, and inferring an individual's profession based on such limited data is statistically unreliable.

**Therefore, without further information, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. **
