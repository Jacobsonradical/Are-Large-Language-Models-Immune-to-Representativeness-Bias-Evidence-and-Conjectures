It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We have no information about the typical personality descriptions of the humanities professors in the study. 

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

{"probability": "0.5"}

I'm providing 0.5 to represent a 50/50 chance, acknowledging that without more information, it's impossible to say if he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities.
