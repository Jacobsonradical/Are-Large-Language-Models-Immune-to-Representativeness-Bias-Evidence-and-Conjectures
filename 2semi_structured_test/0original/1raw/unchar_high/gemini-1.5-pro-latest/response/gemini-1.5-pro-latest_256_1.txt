It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the provided description. The description highlights positive personal qualities and provides no information about his academic interests or career choices. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any randomly selected professor from the study being a computer science professor. Since there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the probability is 75/100 = 0.75.
