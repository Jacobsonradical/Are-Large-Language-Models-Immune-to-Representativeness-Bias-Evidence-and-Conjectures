It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small sample size:**  Even if there were some personality trends within the study, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of comparative information:**  We don't know how the humanities professors were described.  If they were described similarly, it would suggest these traits are common to successful academics in general. 

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is essentially a coin toss:**
