I'm going to be honest - the information provided gives me very little to go off of to determine Jason's field. Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are less likely to be married or have children than humanities professors is based on stereotypes, not evidence.  
* **The description is generic:** The description of Jason could apply to many successful professionals in various fields. 

**Therefore, the best I can do is estimate based on the proportion of computer science professors in the study.**  Since 75 out of the 100 professors were in computer science, there's a higher baseline chance he falls into that category.

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Important Note:** This is purely based on the study's composition, not on any information about Jason himself.
