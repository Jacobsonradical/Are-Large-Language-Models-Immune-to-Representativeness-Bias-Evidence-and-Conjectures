It's impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:**  While there might be stereotypical views about the personalities of computer scientists versus humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and biased. 
* **The description is generic:** The information provided (age, marital status, work ethic, likability) could apply to successful individuals in many fields. 

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as him being from the humanities group, which is 50%.**

**Answer:**

```json
{"probability": "0.5"}
```
