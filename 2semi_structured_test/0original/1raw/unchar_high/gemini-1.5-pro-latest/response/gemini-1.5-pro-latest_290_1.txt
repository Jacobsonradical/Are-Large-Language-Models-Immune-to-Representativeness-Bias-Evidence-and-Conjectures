I cannot give you a probability based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **Description is too general:** The description of Jason is positive but doesn't offer any specific traits that might be more common in computer science professors versus humanities professors. 
* **No comparative information:** We lack information about the personality traits found in the study overall.  To estimate a probability, we'd need to know if certain traits were more prevalent in one group versus the other.

**To illustrate:**

If the study found that 90% of computer science professors were described as "highly motivated" while only 10% of humanities professors were, then the probability of Jason being a computer science professor would increase. However, we don't have that kind of comparative data. 

**In conclusion:**  Without more information about the study's findings on personality differences between the two groups, any probability estimate would be a guess.
