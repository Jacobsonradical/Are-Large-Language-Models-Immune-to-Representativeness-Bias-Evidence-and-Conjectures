I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science. There's nothing in the description specifically suggesting a computer science background.
* **Base rate is crucial:** To estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rate. We know 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science (75%). However, without any distinguishing information about Jason, using the base rate alone would be a fallacy.

**In short, the description doesn't provide any evidence to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor.**
