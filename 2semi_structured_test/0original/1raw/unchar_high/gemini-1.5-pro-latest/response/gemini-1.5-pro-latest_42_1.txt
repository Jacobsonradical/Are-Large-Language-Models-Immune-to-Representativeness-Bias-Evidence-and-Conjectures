I cannot provide a probability estimate based on the information given. Here's why:

* **Description Lacks Relevant Information:** The description focuses on general positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. There's no mention of specific interests, hobbies, or work styles that might hint at a computer science background.
* **Base Rate Matters:**  To estimate probability accurately, we need to consider the base rate.  We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher starting probability (75/100) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science. However, without any information linking the description to computer science specifically, relying on the base rate alone would be misleading.

**In short, the description provides no evidence to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor.  Any probability estimate would be a guess.**
