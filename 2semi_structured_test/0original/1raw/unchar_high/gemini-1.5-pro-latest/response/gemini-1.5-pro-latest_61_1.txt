It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the description provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:**  The description highlights general traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.  
* **Stereotyping is unhelpful:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess these traits is based on stereotypes and not factual.

**Therefore, without further information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the base rate in the study.**

{"probability": "0.75"}

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science. This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor from this study is in computer science.
