It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights general traits that could apply to successful academics in various fields. 

Here's why:

* **Common Traits:**  The description emphasizes high ability, strong motivation, and good interpersonal skills. These traits are valuable for success in both computer science and the humanities. 
* **Lack of Field-Specific Information:** The description lacks any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other clues that might point to his academic discipline.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
``` 

This is because 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science.
