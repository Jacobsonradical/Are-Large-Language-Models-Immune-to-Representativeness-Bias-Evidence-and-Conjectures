It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general positive traits but no specific clues about whether he's more likely to be in computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It describes a successful professional, but the traits (high ability, motivation, well-liked) could apply to many fields.
* **The sample size is skewed:** There are three times as many computer science professors in the study.  While this means there's a higher raw number of computer science professors, it doesn't tell us anything about Jason specifically.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the overall proportion of computer science professors in the study.**
