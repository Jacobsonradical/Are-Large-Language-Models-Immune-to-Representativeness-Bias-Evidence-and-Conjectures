It's impossible to determine the probability of Jason being a computer science professor based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field.**  Traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked" are applicable to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities.
* **The sample size difference is irrelevant without relevant information.** While there are more computer science professors in the study, this doesn't make Jason more likely to be one without information linking him to that field.

**To calculate a probability, we would need data connecting the personality traits or other characteristics mentioned in the description to a higher prevalence in either computer science or humanities.**

Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.
