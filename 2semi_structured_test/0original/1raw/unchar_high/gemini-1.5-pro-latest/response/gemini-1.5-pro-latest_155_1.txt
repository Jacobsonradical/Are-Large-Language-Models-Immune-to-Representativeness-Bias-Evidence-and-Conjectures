It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits can be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just computer science.
* **Small Sample Size:** Even if there were some personality trends within the study, 100 people is a small sample size to draw definitive conclusions about entire fields like computer science and humanities.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We don't know what the descriptions of other professors in the study were like.  Perhaps many humanities professors were also described as highly motivated and well-liked.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability other than a random guess.  My answer would be based on prejudice, not evidence.** 

{"probability": "0.5"}
