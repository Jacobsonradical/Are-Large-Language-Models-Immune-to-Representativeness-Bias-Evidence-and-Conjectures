It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The description highlights general positive traits found in many successful professionals, regardless of their field. 

Here's why:

* **Personality and Success:**  While some personality traits might be slightly more common in certain fields,  there's no strong evidence to suggest computer science professors are inherently more likely to be "high ability," "strongly motivated," or "well-liked" than humanities professors.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if there were subtle personality differences between the fields, a sample size of 100 is relatively small to draw definitive conclusions. 
* **Bias in Description:** The description itself might be biased towards positive traits, given the study's focus on "successful" academics.

**Therefore, given the information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:**
