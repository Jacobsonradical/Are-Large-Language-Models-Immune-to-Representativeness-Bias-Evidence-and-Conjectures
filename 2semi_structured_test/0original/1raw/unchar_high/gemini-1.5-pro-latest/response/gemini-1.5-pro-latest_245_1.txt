It's impossible to determine Jason's field of study based on the provided description. The information given describes general traits and circumstances that could apply to a professor in either computer science or the humanities. 

Here's why:

* **Personality:**  The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are not exclusive to either field.
* **Demographics:** Being 30, married, and childless offers no specific clues about academic specialization.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Explanation:**

* The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
* This means 75 out of 100 professors were from computer science.
* Therefore, there's a 75% chance (or a probability of 0.75) that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science.
