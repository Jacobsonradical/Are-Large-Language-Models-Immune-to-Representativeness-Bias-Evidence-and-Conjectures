It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. The description provides general traits and circumstances common to successful professionals in many fields. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer scientists are more likely to be "high ability" and "strongly motivated" is biased and inaccurate.  Humanities professors require those same traits.
* **The description is vague:**  It lacks specifics about Jason's work style, interests, or even hobbies that might hint at his field.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** Knowing the study's composition doesn't change the fact that Jason's description is equally likely to fit a professor from either field.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as him being in the humanities, which is 50%.**
