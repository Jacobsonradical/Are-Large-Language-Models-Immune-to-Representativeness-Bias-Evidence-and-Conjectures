It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is Unreliable:**  The description relies on general traits that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample from which to draw broad conclusions about entire fields.
* **Lack of Comparative Information:** We don't know anything about the personality descriptions of the other professors in the study.  

**Therefore, I cannot give you a probability.**
