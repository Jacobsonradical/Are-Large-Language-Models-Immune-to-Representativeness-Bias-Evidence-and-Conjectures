It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description.  The description lacks any information about his research, teaching style, or interests that would hint towards computer science or humanities. 

Here's why:

* **General Traits:** The description highlights traits common in many successful professionals, regardless of their field: intelligence, motivation, strong work ethic, and good interpersonal skills.  
* **Lack of Specifics:** There's nothing about Jason's work, hobbies, or interests that would even stereotypically align him with either field. 

**Therefore, the probability is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the original sample:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
``` 

**Important Note:** This assumes the description was chosen randomly. If there was any bias in selecting this specific description, the probability could change.
