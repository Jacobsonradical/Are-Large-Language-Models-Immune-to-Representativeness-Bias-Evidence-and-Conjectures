It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is unreliable:**  The description relies on generic traits like "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked." These traits can be found in successful individuals across many professions, not just computer science.
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample size from which to draw conclusions about entire fields as broad as computer science and humanities.
* **Lack of field-specific information:**  The description provides no information about Jason's research, teaching style, interests, or any other factor that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.**  

{"probability": "0.5"} 

I'm defaulting to 0.5 (50%) to represent that, without further information, both computer science and humanities are equally likely.
