It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The characteristics described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific information:** There are no clues about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other aspect that might hint at his academic field.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate provided in the study: 75 computer science professors out of 100 total.
