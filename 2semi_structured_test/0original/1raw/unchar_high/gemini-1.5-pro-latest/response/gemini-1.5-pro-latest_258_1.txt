It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information relevant to either field:**  It mentions personality traits (high ability, strong motivation), relationship status (married, no children), and social standing (well-liked, positive reputation). None of these are inherently indicative of being a computer science or humanities professor.
* **Stereotyping is dangerous:** Assuming all computer science professors are introverted or that all humanities professors are extroverted is inaccurate and unhelpful.

**Therefore, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, there's a 75% chance Jason is one of them, but this is based purely on the study's composition, not the description provided.
