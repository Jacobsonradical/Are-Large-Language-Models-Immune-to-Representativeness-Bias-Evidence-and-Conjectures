It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general positive traits that could be found in professors from various disciplines. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are unreliable:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be "high ability" or that humanities professors are less likely to be "well-liked" is based on harmful stereotypes. 
* **Description is generic:** The description lacks any specific details that might hint at Jason's field, such as research interests, teaching style, or hobbies.

Since there's no information to differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, the probability is equal for both:

{"probability": "0.5"}
