It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description lacks specific clues:** The description doesn't offer any information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might hint at his field.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, making the prior probability 75%.
