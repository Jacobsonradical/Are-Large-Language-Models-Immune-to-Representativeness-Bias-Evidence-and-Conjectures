I cannot give a reliable probability estimate based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason,"  are more likely to be married without children at 30, or possess high ability and strong motivation is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence.
* **Lack of comparative information:** The description doesn't tell us how common or uncommon these traits are among *either* computer science *or* humanities professors.  
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors (and only 75 computer science professors) is a relatively small sample from which to draw broad conclusions.

**To provide a meaningful probability, I would need information about how these traits correlate with each field within the study data.**
