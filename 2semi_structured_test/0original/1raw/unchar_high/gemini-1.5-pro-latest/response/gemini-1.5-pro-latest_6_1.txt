It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The description highlights positive personality traits and life circumstances that could be equally applicable to professors in both computer science and the humanities.  

Here's why:

* **Age:** 30 years old is a plausible age for a tenured professor in both fields.
* **Marital Status:**  Being married with or without children doesn't favor either field. 
* **High Ability & Motivation:** These traits are desirable for success in any academic discipline.
* **Well-liked & Positive Reputation:**  This suggests good interpersonal skills, valuable in both fields. 

Therefore, without any information linking his traits or experiences specifically to computer science, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.
