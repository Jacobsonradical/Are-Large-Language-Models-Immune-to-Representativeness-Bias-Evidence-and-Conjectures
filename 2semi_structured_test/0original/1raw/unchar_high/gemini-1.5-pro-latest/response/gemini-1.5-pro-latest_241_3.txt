It's impossible to determine Jason's field based on the information given. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:** The description highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many professions, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There is nothing in the description about Jason's interests, research, teaching style, or any other factor that would hint at his field of study.
* **Base rates are important:** We know there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base rate (75%) of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science. However, without any information linking the description to computer science specifically, we can't assume Jason belongs to that group.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be a guess.** 

While the higher base rate of computer science professors might tempt you to lean towards a probability above 0.5, it wouldn't be a deduction based on the provided information.
