It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, or possess high ability and motivation is based on stereotypes, not factual evidence. 
* **Description lacks specific clues:** The description highlights general positive traits applicable to successful individuals in various fields.  There's no mention of teaching style, research interests, or other details that might hint at Jason's academic discipline.

**Therefore, without more information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:** 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were from computer science, making the probability 75/100 = 0.75.
