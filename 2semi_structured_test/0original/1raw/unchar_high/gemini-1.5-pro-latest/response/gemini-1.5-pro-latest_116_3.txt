It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  It highlights positive traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in *any* field, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific clues:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, or work style that hints at computer science specifically.
* **Small sample size:**  While the study involved 100 professors, this is a relatively small sample size from which to draw strong conclusions about personality traits and profession.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study: 75/100.**
