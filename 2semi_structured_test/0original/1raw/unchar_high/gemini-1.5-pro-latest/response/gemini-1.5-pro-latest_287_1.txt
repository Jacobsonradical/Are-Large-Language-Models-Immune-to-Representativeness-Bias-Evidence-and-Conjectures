It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description is generic:**  The traits listed (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science. 
* **No field-specific information:** There's nothing about Jason's interests, hobbies, work habits, or anything else that would give a clue about his area of expertise.

**Therefore, without any information linking him to computer science, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.**

While there were more computer science professors in the study, this fact alone doesn't make it more likely that Jason is one of them. 

To provide a meaningful probability, we would need more information specific to Jason and how he compares to the typical traits of professors in each field.
