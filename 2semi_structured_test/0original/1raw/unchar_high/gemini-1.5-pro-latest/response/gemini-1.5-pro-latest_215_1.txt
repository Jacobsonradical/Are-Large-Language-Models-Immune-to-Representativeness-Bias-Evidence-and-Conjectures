It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping is inaccurate:**  Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be male, married without children, highly motivated, or well-liked is based on stereotypes, not evidence. 
* **Description is generic:** The description could easily apply to a successful professor in many fields, not just computer science.

**To calculate the probability, you'd need more information that actually relates to the differences between the two fields.**

**Therefore, the most accurate probability I can give is based on the initial sample sizes:**

* **75 out of 100 professors were from computer science.**

{"probability": "0.75"}
