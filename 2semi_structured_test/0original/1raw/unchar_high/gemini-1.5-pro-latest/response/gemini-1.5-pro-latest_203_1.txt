I cannot give you a probability based on the information provided. 

Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:** The description of Jason could apply to a successful academic in many fields, not just computer science. There's no information about his research interests, teaching style, or other factors that might differentiate between disciplines. 
* **Base rate matters:**  We need to consider the base rate, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the original sample (75 out of 100). Even if the description was slightly more suggestive of a computer science professor, the higher base rate would still be a major factor.

**To estimate the probability, I would need more information that is specifically relevant to distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors.**
