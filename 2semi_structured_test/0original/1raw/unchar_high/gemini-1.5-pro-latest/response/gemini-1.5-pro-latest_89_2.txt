It is impossible to determine Jason's profession based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** Assuming computer science professors are more likely to be named "Jason," be married without children at 30, or possess high ability and motivation is stereotypical and inaccurate.  These traits can be found in individuals across various professions.
* **Insufficient Information:** The description lacks specific details about Jason's work style, interests, or any other clues that might hint at his field of study.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate.  The chances of Jason being a computer science professor are equal to him being in the humanities, without further information.** 

{"probability": "0.5"}
