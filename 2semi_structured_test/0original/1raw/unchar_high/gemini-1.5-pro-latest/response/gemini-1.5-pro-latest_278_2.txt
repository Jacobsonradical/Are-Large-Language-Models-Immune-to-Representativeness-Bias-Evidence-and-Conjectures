It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks field-specific information:** The description focuses on general personality traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **The sample size is irrelevant:** Knowing that there are more computer science professors in the study doesn't tell us anything specific about Jason.

**Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary.** 

If you want to explore the influence of the sample sizes, you could ask about the **prior probability** of a randomly selected professor from this study being in computer science.  That would be:

{"probability": "0.75"} 

(Since 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science).
