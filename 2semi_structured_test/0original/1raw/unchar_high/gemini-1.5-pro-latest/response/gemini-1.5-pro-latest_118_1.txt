I'm sorry, but based on the information given, it is impossible to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

The description provided offers general traits and circumstances common to many successful academics, regardless of their field. There is no specific information about Jason's research interests, teaching style, or any other clues that would indicate a higher likelihood of him being in computer science versus humanities. 

To calculate a probability, we would need some correlation between the provided description and the likelihood of being in one field over the other. 

Therefore, any probability I provide would be a guess and not based on the evidence given.
