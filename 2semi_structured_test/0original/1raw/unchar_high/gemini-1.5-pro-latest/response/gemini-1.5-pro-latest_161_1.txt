It's impossible to determine the probability with the information given. Here's why:

* **The description is too generic:**  The description of Jason could apply to a successful professional in many fields, not just computer science or humanities. 
* **No distinguishing personality traits:** The description doesn't highlight any personality traits that are stereotypically associated with either computer science or humanities professors.
* **Sample size is irrelevant:** While we know the study size, the description doesn't give us any clues to tie it back to the proportions within the study.

**To give you a meaningful probability, we would need more information that could potentially distinguish between the two groups of professors.** 

For example:

* Information about Jason's hobbies and interests.
* Specific personality traits revealed by the tests that might be more prevalent in one field over the other.

**Therefore:**

{"probability": "Cannot be determined from the information provided"}
