It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **The description lacks information specific to either field:** It mentions positive personality traits and life circumstances common across professions. 
* **The sample size difference doesn't automatically translate to probability:** While there's a larger proportion of computer science professors in the study, this doesn't directly correlate to a higher probability for Jason specifically.

Therefore, any probability assigned would be arbitrary. 

**{"probability": "Cannot be determined"}**
