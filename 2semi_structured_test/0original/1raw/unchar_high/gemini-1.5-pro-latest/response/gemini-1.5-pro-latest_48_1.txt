It's impossible to determine Jason's field based solely on the provided description. 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes are misleading:**  While we might have stereotypes about computer scientists and humanities professors, these are often inaccurate and unreliable for judging individuals. 
* **The description is generic:**  The information provided (age, marital status, personality) could apply to successful individuals in many fields, not just these two.

**Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the study:**

```json
{"probability": "0.75"} 
```

**Explanation:**  Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are from computer science, there's a 75% chance that any randomly chosen description, including Jason's, belongs to a computer science professor.
