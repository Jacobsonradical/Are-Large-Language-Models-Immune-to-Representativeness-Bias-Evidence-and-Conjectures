It is impossible to determine Jason's field of study based solely on the description provided. The information given describes general positive traits that could be applicable to professors in various fields. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the probability of any randomly chosen professor from the sample being a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, the probability is:
