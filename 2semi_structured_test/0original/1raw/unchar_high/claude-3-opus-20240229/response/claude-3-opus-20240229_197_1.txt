Your question is about estimating the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the limited information provided. The key is to focus on the relevant information given, which is the base rates of the two groups (computer science professors and humanities professors).

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information to suggest he is more likely to be part of one group or the other. It would be a mistake to read too much into generic traits like being well-liked or highly motivated.

In the absence of distinguishing information, the best estimate is to rely on the base rates. The sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Thus, without any other relevant information, the probability of a randomly selected individual from this sample being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
