Given the limited information provided, it would be natural to guess that the probability Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75, since 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science.

However, this description actually provides no information that would allow us to update the prior probability. The details given, such as Jason's age, marital status, ability, motivation and reputation, are not specifically linked to either field. Without any distinguishing information, the probability remains the same as the base rate in the sample.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
