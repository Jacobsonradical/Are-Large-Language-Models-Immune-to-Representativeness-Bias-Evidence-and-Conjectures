To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's specific traits that might distinguish him as more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor, the best estimate is to use the base rate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 75/100 = 0.75.
