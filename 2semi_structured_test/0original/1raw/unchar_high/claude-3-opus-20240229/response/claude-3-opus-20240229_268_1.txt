To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

Without any additional distinguishing information in the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate.
