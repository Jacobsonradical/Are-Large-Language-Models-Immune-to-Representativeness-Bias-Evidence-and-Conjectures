Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where available specific information tends to overshadow general statistical information.

From the study description, we know that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, and 25% are humanities professors. This is the base rate or prior probability.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any information specific to his field. The details given, such as his age, marital status, ability, motivation, and reputation, could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should align with the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75% or 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
