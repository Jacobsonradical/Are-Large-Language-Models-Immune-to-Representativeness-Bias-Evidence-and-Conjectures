To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, or 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is a computer science or humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in either field.

In the absence of specific distinguishing information, our best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
