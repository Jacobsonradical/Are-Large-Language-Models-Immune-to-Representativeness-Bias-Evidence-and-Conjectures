Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias. Even though the description of Jason may sound like it could fit a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the fact that there are far more computer science professors (75) in the sample than humanities professors (25).

Without any other identifying information, the probability that a randomly selected profile belongs to a computer science professor is 75%, since 75 out of the 100 professors in the study are in computer science.

The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to many successful professors, regardless of field. It doesn't provide any strong evidence to sway us away from the base rate probability.

Therefore, even though our intuition may lean towards guessing a lower probability, the most rational answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
