Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy. Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, we cannot ignore the base rates - the fact that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors.

Without any other information to distinguish Jason, we have to go with the base rates. Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
