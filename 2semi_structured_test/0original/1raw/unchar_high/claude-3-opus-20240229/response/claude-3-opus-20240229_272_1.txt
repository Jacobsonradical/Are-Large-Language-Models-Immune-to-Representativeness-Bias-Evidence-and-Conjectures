To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's specific field, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The information about his age, marital status, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues could apply to professors in either field.

Therefore, based on the given information and the prior probabilities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
