Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (75%) compared to a humanities professor (25%), assuming the descriptions were chosen at random.

Therefore, using the prior probabilities alone, I estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is not a highly confident estimate, as it relies solely on the base rates without considering Jason's specific characteristics that could indicate his field. More relevant information would be needed to make a more accurate assessment.
