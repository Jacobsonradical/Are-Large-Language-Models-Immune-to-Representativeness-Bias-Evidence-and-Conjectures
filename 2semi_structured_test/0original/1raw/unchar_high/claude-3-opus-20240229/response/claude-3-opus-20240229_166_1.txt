To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The description itself does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, without additional information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.75 or 75%.
