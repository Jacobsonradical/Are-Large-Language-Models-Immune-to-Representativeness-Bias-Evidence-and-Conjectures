To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would allow us to distinguish whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description could apply equally well to a successful professor in either field.

In the absence of distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
