To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any specific information distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors in the description, the best estimate is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
