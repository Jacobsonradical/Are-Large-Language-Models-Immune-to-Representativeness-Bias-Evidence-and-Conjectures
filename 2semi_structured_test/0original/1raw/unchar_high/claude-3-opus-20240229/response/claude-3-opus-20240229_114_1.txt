To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Given:
- 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science
- 25 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
