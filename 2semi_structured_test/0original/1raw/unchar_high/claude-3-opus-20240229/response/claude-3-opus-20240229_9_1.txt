To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates in the sample population.

Given:
- The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any specific information in the description that would indicate Jason's field, we can assume that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 or 75%.
