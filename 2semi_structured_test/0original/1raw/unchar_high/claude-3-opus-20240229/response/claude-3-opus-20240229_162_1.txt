To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description focuses on his personality traits, which could apply to professors in either field.

Therefore, without additional disambiguating information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
