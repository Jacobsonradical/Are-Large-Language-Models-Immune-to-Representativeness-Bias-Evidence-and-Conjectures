To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total sample size
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
