Your intuition may be to assign a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor, since 75% of the sample consisted of computer science professors. However, the description provided does not contain any information specific to computer science versus humanities professors. It only provides general positive traits that could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, given the lack of distinguishing information in the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should simply reflect the base rates in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
