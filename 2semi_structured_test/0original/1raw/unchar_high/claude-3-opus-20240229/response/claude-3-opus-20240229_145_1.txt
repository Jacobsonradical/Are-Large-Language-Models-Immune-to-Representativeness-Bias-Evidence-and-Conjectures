To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science.
- 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in the humanities.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rates. So our best estimate is to assume he has a 75% probability of being a computer science professor, matching the proportion in the sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
