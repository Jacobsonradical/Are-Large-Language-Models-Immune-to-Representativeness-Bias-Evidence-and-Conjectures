To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates provided about the professors in the sample.

Given:
- The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of study or research.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, the best estimate of the probability would be based on the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the limited information, is 0.75 or 75%.
