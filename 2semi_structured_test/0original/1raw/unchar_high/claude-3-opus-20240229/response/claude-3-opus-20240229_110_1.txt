To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75/100 = 0.75.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would indicate whether he's more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor, our best estimate is the base rate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
