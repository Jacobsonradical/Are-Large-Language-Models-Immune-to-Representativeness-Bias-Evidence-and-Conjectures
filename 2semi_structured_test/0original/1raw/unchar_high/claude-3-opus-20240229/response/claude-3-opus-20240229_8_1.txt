To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

75 computer science professors / (75 computer science professors + 25 humanities professors) = 75/100 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given no other information, is 0.75.
