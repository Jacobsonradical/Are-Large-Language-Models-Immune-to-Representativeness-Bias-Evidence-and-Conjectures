To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the information provided about the base rates in the sample, rather than stereotypes or assumptions about computer science professors.

The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without any additional information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to update this prior probability. It does not mention his field, and the traits described could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
