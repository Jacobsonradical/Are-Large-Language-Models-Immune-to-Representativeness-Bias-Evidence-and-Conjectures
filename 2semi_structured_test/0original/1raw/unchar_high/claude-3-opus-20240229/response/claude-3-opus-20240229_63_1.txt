Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation are not specific to either field.

Therefore, without any field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based solely on the base rates provided in the setup: 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors.

{"probability": "0.75"}
