To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, our best estimate is the base rate probability.

{"probability": "0.75"}
