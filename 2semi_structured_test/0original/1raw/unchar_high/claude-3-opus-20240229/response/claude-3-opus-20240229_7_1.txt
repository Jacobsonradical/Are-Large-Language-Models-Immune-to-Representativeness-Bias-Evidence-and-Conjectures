Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. 

So in the absence of other distinguishing information, I will lean towards this base rate as my estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}
