Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions about Jason's field based on the brief description. Without more relevant details indicating his specific area of expertise, the probability of him being a computer science professor should be based on the prior probability from the study's sample.

The sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor from this sample being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
