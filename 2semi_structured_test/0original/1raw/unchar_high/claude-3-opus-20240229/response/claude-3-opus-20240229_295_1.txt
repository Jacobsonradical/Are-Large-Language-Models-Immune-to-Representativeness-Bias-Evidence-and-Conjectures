Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field of study.

However, given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability that a randomly selected individual from this group would be a computer science professor.

Without additional field-specific information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based solely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, as there are no other clear indicators in the description to sway the probability either way.
