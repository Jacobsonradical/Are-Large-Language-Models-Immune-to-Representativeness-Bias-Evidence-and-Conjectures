Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field. However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. Therefore, in the absence of other distinguishing information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
