To answer this question, we need to avoid falling prey to base rate neglect. The key is to consider the base rates - the relative proportions of CS professors and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample
- In total there are 100 professors

So the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a CS professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to a successful professor in any field. It doesn't provide any information specific to computer science or the humanities that would cause us to update the prior probabilities.

Therefore, lacking any additional field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of CS professors in the sample, i.e. 0.75.
