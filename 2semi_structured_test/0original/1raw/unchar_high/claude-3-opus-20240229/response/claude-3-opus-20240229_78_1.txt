Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The description of Jason provides no information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only contains generic positive attributes that could apply to any successful professor, regardless of field.

Without any field-specific information to guide us, the only relevant information we have is the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, for any randomly selected professor, there is a 75% chance they are a computer science professor and a 25% chance they are a humanities professor.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
