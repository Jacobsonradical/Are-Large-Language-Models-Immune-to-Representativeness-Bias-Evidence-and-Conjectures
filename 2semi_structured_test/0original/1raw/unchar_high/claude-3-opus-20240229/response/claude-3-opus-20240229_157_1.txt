To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Key points:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any specific information about his field of study.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, we should base our probability estimate on the base rates in the sample. Since 75 out of 100 professors in the study are computer science professors, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Therefore, given the limited information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
