Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

Since 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, without any other distinguishing information, the base rate probability is that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, this is a tentative estimate given the very limited data provided about Jason's specific characteristics and background.
