To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest he's more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits of being highly capable, motivated, well-liked and having a good professional reputation could easily apply to successful professors in both computer science and the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing information, we should guess Jason's field based on the base rate probability. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, that should also be the probability we assign to Jason being a computer science professor.
