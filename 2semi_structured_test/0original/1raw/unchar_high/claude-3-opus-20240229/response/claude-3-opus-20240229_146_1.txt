Based on the limited information provided, it's impossible to determine with certainty whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description of Jason's personality traits and demographics could plausibly fit either field.

However, given that the study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being of a computer science professor, before considering the specifics of the description.

So based purely on the 3:1 ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample, I'd estimate a 75% probability that a randomly selected description is of a computer science professor.
