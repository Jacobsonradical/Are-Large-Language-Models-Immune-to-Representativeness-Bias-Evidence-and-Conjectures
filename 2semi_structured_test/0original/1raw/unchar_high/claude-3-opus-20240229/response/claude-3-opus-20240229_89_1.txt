Your question is drawing on concepts related to representativeness and base rates in probability assessments.

Given the limited information provided, the most principled approach is to estimate the probability based on the base rates, or prior probabilities, of the two categories of professors in the sample.

In the sample of 100 professors, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. So absent any other distinguishing information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason, while positive, does not provide any strong indication that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, lacking information to substantially update the prior probability, the estimate should remain close to the base rate of 0.75.
