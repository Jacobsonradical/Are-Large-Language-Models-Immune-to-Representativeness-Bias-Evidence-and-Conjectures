To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample.

Probability = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, there is a 75% probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor.
