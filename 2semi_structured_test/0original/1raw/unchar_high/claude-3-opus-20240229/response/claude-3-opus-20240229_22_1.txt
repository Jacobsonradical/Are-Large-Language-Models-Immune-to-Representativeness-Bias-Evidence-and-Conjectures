To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional information specific to Jason that would make him more likely to be in one group or the other, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is:

75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

Therefore, based on the given information, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
