Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. Without additional distinguishing information, this would be the best estimate.
