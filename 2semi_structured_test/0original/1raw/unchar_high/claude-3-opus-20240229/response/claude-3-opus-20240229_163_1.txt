To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields. The correct probability can be calculated based solely on the proportions of professors from each field in the sample.

The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
