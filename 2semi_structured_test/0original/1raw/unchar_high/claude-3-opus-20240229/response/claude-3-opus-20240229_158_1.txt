Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy. The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The only relevant information given is the base rate - that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Given this, the probability that a randomly selected individual from the group is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
