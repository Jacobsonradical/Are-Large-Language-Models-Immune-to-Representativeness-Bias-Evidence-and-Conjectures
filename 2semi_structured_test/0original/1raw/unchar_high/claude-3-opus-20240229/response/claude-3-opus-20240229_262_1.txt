To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be from one field or the other. His personality traits and characteristics could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Therefore, lacking other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
