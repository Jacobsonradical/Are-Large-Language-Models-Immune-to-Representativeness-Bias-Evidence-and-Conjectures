Your question is asking me to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the limited information provided. To answer this in a sound way, we need to avoid common errors in probabilistic reasoning.

One key piece of information is the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. So without considering any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason provides no clear distinguishing information to suggest he's more likely to be in one field or the other. Qualities like being motivated, high ability, well-liked etc. are quite general and could easily apply to successful professors in either discipline.

So in the absence of any specific diagnostic evidence, the principled answer is to stick with the prior probability based on the base rates in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}

It would be a base rate fallacy to ignore the background information about the composition of the sample and guess something like 50/50. The description doesn't provide sufficient evidence to deviate from the base rate.
