To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

In the absence of specific evidence pointing to either field, it is reasonable to default to the base rate probability.
