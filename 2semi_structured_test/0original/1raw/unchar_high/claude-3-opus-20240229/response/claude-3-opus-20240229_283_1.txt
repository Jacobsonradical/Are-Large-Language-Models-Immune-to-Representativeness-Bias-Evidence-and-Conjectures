To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the relative sizes of the two groups in the sample.

Given:
- 75 of the professors are in computer science
- 25 of the professors are in the humanities
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

75 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personality traits could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, based on the information given, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
