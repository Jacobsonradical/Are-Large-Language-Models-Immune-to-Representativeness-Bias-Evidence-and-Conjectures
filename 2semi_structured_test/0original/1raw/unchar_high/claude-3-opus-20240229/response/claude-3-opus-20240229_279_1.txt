Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate or prior probability is ignored or underweighted.

In this case, the base rate is that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected person being a computer science professor is 0.75.

The description of Jason provides no information to differentiate him as a computer science or humanities professor. The traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, lacking any specific evidence about Jason's field, the probability of him being a computer science professor is simply the base rate in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
