To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any specific information about his field of expertise.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
