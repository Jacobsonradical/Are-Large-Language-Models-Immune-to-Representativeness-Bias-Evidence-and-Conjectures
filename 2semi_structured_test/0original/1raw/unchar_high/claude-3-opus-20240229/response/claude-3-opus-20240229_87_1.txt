To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Given no additional information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would lead us to update this prior probability. The description does not mention his field of study or any traits that are clearly associated with either computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
