To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the prior probabilities before considering the specific description.

In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without any other information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not seem to provide any strong evidence to sway this probability in either direction. The details given (age, marital status, being well-liked and motivated) could apply to successful professors in many fields.

So in the absence of distinguishing information, it's reasonable to stick with the base rate probability.
