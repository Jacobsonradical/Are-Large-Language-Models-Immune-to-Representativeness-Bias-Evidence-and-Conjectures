To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - that is, the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the study, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would make him more likely to be in one group or the other, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

75 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
