To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.

{"probability": "0.75"}
