To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear indication that he's more likely to be in one field or the other. His personal characteristics could apply to a successful professor in either computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of field-specific information, we should defer to the base rates. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor is 0.75.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
