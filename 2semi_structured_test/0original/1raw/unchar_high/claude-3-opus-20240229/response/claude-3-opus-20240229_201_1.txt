To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes. Instead, let's look at the relevant information provided:

- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- No information is given about Jason's field of study.
- The description focuses on Jason's personality traits, which seem to be positive but are not clearly associated with a particular academic discipline.

Given that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, and lacking any specific information indicating Jason's field, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
