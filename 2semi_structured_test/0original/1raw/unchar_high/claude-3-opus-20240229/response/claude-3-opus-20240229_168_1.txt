To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, without considering any other information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason provides no specific information to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability. The details about his age, marital status, personality traits, and reputation do not clearly distinguish him as a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should align with the base rate.
