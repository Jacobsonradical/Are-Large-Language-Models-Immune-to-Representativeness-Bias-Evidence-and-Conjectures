To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so without any additional information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to sway us from this base rate. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation do not clearly distinguish him as more likely to be from one field or the other.

Therefore, given the lack of discriminating information, it is reasonable to stick close to the base rate probability.
