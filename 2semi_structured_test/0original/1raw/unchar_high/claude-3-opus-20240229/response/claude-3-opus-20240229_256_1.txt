To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem description.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's specific field, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
