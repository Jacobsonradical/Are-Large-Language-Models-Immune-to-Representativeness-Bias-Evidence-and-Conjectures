Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to make a confident determination of whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field. Assigning a probability would be speculative without more relevant details.

However, if I must provide a probability estimate in the requested format, given that 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, I would lean towards guessing he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. But this is a tentative estimate made with low confidence.

{"probability": "0.75"}
