Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event (the base rate) in favor of specific information that may not be as relevant.

In this case, the key information is that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, while only 25% are humanities professors. This is the base rate.

The description of Jason does not provide any information that would specifically indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits described could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, without any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 75%, or 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
