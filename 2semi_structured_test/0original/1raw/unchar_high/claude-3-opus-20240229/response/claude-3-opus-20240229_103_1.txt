To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science:
P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from humanities:
P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. Therefore, our best estimate is to rely on the prior probabilities.
