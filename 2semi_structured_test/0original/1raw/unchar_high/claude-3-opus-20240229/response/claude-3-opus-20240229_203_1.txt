Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description of being well-liked, highly capable and motivated could apply to successful professors in either field.

However, given that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, the base rate alone would suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor, even before considering his specific description.

So based purely on the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, I'd estimate a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor.

{"probability": "0.75"}
