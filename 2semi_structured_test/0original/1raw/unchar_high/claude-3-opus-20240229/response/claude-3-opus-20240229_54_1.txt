To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - that is, the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75/100 = 0.75, or 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description focuses on his personality traits, which could apply to professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of any additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rate alone.
