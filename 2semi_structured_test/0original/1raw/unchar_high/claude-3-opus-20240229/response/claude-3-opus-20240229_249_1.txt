I appreciate you providing this interesting question, but I don't believe I have enough information to give a well-justified probability estimate. The description of Jason does not contain any details that clearly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.

The base rate of 75% computer science professors in the overall sample provides some relevant prior probability. However, without knowing how representative or distinguishing Jason's described traits are of computer science vs. humanities professors, I don't feel I can assign an updated probability with confidence.

I would need more data on how the described characteristics correlate with each field to move my estimate away from the base rate in either direction. Apologies I can't give a more definitive probability without additional information.

{"probability": "0.75"}
