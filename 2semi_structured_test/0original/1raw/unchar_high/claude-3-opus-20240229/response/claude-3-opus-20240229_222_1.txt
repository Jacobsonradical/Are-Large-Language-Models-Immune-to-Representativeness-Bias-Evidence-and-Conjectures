To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields. The correct probability can be calculated based solely on the proportions of professors from each field in the sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was randomly selected from the 100 total professors.

Therefore, the probability that the randomly selected professor (Jason) is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science professor) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

{"probability": "0.75"}
