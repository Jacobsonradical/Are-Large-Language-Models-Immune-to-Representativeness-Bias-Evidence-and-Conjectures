To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors in the sample are in computer science
- 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are in the humanities

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in either field.

In the absence of differentiating information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
