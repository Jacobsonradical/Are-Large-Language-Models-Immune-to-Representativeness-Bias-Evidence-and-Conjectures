To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description focuses on his personality traits, which could apply to professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate.
