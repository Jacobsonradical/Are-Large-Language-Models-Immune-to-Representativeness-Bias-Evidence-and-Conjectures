Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common error in probabilistic reasoning.

Given the limited information provided, the most reasonable probability estimate is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the overall sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to update this probability. It does not mention any characteristics that are clearly indicative of being either a computer science or humanities professor. High ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked are traits that could apply to successful professors in any field.

Therefore, in the absence of any truly distinguishing information, we should defer to the base rate.

{"probability": "0.75"}
