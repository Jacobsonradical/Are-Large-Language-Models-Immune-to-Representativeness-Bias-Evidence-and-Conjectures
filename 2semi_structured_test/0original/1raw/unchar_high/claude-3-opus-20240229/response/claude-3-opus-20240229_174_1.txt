To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Without any other specific information in the description that would strongly indicate whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, our best estimate is the base rate probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
