Given the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1) The study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Based on this ratio alone, there is a 75% prior probability that any randomly selected description would be of a computer science professor.

2) The description of Jason does not contain any information that would strongly suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned like high ability, motivation, and being well-liked seem like they could apply to successful professors in many fields.

3) Jason's relatively young age of 30 for a tenured professor might slightly favor him being in computer science rather than humanities, since computer science professors may tend to reach tenure at somewhat younger ages on average. However, this is a relatively weak signal.

So in the absence of other distinguishing information, I defer to the 75% prior probability based on the sample composition. The final probability could shift somewhat in either direction with additional relevant details about Jason.
