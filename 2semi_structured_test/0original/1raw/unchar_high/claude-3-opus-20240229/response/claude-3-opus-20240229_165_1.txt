To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75/100 = 0.75, or 75%.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate itself.
