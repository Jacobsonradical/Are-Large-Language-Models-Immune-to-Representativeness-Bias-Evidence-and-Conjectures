Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event and instead focus on specific information.

In this case, even though the description of Jason seems to fit a stereotypical successful professor, we cannot ignore the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample. 

So without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is 75%, based solely on the proportions in the sample.
