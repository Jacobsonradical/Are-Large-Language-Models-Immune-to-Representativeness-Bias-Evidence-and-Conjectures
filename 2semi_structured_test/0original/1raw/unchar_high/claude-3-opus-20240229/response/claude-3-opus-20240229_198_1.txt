To accurately estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information to suggest he belongs to either group. His personality traits could apply to a successful professor in any field.

In the absence of distinguishing information, the best estimate is the base rate probability:

P(Computer Science Professor | Jason's description) = P(Computer Science Professor)
= 75/100 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75, based on the composition of the sample.
