To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

It's important to note that the description of Jason does not provide any information that would allow us to update this probability. The description could apply equally well to a computer science or humanities professor. In the absence of field-specific information, we should stick with the base rate probability.
