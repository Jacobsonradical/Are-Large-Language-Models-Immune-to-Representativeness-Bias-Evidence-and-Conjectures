Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess, there is a 75% chance that a randomly selected individual from the sample would be a computer science professor.

So without any other discriminating information to go on, I'll provide that as my estimated probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
