To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the information provided about the base rates of the two groups (computer science professors and humanities professors) in the sample, rather than on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields.

Given:
- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional information specific to computer science or humanities professors, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based on the given information, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
