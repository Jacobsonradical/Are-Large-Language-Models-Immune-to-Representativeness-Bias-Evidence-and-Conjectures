To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description provided does not contain any information specific to either field.

Without additional information to distinguish between the two groups, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
