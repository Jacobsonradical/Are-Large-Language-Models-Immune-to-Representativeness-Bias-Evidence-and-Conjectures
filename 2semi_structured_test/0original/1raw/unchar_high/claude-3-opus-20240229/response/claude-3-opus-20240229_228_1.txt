Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. The description does not contain any information specific to his field of study or research.

Given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess, I would say there is a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this is just the base rate from the sample, not an informed estimate based on Jason's specific characteristics.

{"probability": "0.75"}
