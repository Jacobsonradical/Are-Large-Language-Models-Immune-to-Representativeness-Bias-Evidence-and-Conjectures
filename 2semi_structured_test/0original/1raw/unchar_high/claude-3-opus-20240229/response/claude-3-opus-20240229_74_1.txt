Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias where people tend to ignore general information (base rates) and focus too heavily on specific information.

In this case, the base rate is that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the probability of a randomly selected person being a computer science professor is 75%.

The description of Jason provides no information to differentiate him as being more likely to belong to either group. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation could apply equally to professors in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of any truly distinguishing information, the probability should reflect the base rate.

{"probability": "0.75"}
