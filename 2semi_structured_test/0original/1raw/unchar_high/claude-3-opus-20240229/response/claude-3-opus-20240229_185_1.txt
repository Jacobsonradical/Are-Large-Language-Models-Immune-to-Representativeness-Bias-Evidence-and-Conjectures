Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions about Jason's field based on stereotypes or biases. The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from the group is a computer science professor is 0.75, since 75 out of the 100 professors studied were in computer science.

Without clear evidence that the description of Jason is more or less likely to apply to computer science vs. humanities professors, the field he belongs to cannot be determined with high confidence. Therefore, based on the prior probability alone, a reasonable estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
