Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a strong determination about Jason's field. The description doesn't mention any traits or characteristics that are clearly linked with either computer science or the humanities. His age, marital status, ability, motivation and reputation with colleagues don't strongly point to one field over the other.

Without more relevant details, the most reasonable probability estimate is simply the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample of 100. Since there were 75 computer science professors out of the 100 total, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is in computer science is 75%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
