While the description of Jason provides some relevant information, it does not contain enough specific details to conclusively determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his field of study or research interests, which would be the strongest indicators of his academic discipline.

Given that the study sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if we had no additional information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor would be 75%. However, the limited information provided about Jason being well-liked and having a positive reputation among colleagues is likely applicable to successful professors across various disciplines.

Therefore, based on the available information and the composition of the study sample, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
