To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information:

- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description provided does not contain any specific information about Jason's field of study.

Given that there is no information in the description to suggest whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, the best estimate of the probability would be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
