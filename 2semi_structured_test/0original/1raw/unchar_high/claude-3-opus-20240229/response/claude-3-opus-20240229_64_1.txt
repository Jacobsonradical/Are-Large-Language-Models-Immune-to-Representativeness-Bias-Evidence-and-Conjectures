Just because there were more computer science professors in the sample overall does not necessarily mean this particular individual is more likely to be a computer science professor. The description provided does not contain any information specific to computer science versus the humanities. Without more relevant details, I do not have enough information to assign a probability much different from the baseline proportion of 75% computer science professors in the sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
