Your intuition may be to assign a high probability to Jason being a computer science professor based on the limited information provided. However, the correct answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is because the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other distinguishing information about Jason relevant to his field, the probability he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate - the proportion of CS professors in the sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75.

This question illustrates an important concept in probability called the base rate fallacy. People often tend to ignore overall prevalence of outcomes and over-weight specific information, even when that information is not very diagnostic. But the base rates are critical for correct probabilistic reasoning.
