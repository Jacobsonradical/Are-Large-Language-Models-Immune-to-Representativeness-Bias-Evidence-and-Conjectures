Given the limited information provided, it's impossible to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description doesn't mention his specific field.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there's a 75% probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the overall group.

Without additional distinguishing information, assigning the baseline probability is most reasonable. Therefore:

{"probability": "0.75"}
