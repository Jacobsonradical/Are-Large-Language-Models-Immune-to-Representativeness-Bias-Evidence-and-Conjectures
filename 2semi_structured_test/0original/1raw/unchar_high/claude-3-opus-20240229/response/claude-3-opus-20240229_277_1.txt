Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful tenured professors in many fields.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of 75% that a randomly selected description would be of a computer science professor.

So without any other distinguishing information to go on, I'll estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be 0.75, in line with the base rates in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
