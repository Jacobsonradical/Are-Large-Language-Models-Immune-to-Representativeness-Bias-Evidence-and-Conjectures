To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information:

- The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of expertise.

Without additional information directly relating to Jason's field, the best estimate of the probability would be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.75 or 75%.
