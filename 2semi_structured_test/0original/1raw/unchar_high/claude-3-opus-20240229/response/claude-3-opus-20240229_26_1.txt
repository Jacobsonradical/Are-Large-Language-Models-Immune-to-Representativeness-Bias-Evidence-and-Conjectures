Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, to properly estimate the probability we need to account for the base rates in the sample - there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected person from this sample is a computer science professor is 75%. The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to many academics, so it doesn't provide enough specific evidence to significantly shift this base rate probability.

Therefore, even though the description may subjectively sound like a computer science professor, I'd still estimate the probability to be close to the base rate of 75%:

{"probability": "0.75"}
