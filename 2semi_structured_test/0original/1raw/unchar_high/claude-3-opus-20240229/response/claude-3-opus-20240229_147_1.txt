To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which are 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of which field he is in. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in either computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of field-specific information, our best estimate is to assign a probability matching the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
