To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any additional information about Jason that is specifically related to his field, the best estimate of the probability that he is a computer science professor is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
