To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the limited information provided and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason does not include any information directly related to his field of study.

Without further information directly linking Jason's description to either field, the best estimate of the probability would be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
