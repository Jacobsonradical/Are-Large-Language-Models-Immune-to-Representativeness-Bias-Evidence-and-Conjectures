To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Key facts:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not contain any information directly related to his field of study.

Given that there is no field-specific information in Jason's description, the best estimate of the probability that he is a computer science professor is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
