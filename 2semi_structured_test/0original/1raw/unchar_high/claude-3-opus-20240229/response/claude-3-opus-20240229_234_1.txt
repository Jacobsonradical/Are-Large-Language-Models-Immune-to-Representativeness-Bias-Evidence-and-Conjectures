Your question is drawing on concepts related to the representativeness heuristic and base rate neglect. The base rate is the prior probability of an event, which in this case is the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science, given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. However, people often neglect this base rate information and instead make their judgment based on how representative or similar the description is to their stereotype of the group in question.

The description of Jason is quite general and could apply to many successful professors, regardless of field. There aren't any distinctive characteristics that would strongly suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor.

Therefore, in the absence of such distinguishing information, the prior probabilities are the best guide. Given that 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science is 75%.
