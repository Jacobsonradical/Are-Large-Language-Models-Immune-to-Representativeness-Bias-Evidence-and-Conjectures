Your question is actually a well-known probability puzzle called the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The key is to recognize that the description of Jason provides no information to distinguish whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description is generic and could apply equally to either field.

Therefore, the probability simply comes down to the base rates - the fact that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors and 25% are humanities professors.

So even though the description mentions nothing specific to computer science, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75, simply because that's the proportion of CS professors in the sample.
