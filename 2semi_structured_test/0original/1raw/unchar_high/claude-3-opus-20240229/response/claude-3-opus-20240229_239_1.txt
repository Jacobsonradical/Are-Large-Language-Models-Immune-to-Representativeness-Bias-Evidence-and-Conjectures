Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to confidently determine whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field or area of expertise.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected individual from the group being a computer science professor is 75%. However, this should not be taken as the answer, as the description provided does not give enough relevant information to shift the probability away from this baseline.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
