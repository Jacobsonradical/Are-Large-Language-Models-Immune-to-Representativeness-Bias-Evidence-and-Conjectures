Given the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful tenured professors in many fields.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, the base rate alone suggests Jason is more likely to be randomly selected from the larger group of computer science professors, assuming no other information.

So based purely on the 75% base rate of computer science professors in the sample, I'd estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}

But I want to emphasize this probability estimate is highly uncertain given the extremely limited information provided about Jason to distinguish his likely field.
