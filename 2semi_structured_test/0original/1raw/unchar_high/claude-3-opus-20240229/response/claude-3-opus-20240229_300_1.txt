To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the baseline proportion of computer science professors in the sample, and whether the description provides any additional evidence to update this probability.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not provide any clear indication of Jason's field.

The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, based purely on the sample composition, is:
P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Since the description is generic and could apply to professors in either field, it does not provide significant evidence to update this probability.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
