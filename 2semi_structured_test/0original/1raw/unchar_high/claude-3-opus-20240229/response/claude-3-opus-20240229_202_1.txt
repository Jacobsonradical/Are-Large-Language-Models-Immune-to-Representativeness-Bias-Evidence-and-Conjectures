To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors.
- 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are humanities professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

{"probability": "0.75"}
