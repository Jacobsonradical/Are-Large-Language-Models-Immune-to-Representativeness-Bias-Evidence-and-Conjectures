To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates in the sample. Out of the 100 professors studied, 75 were computer science professors and 25 were humanities professors.

Given no other information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would sway the probability in either direction. His age, marital status, lack of children, high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation could apply to professors in both computer science and the humanities.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains in line with the base rate of the sample.
