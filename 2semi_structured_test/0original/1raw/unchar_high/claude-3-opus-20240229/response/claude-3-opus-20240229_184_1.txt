To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the available information about the sample and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional information in the description that specifically indicates Jason's field of study, we can assume that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
