Given the limited information provided, there is no strong evidence to suggest whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in many fields.

The only relevant information is the base rates: 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science, while 25% are in the humanities. Absent any other distinguishing information, the base rates provide the best estimate of the probability.

Therefore, based solely on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
