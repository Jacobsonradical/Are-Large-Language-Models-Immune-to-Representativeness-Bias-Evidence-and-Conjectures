To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

The description provides no clear evidence to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rates in the sample. His age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation do not clearly distinguish him as being more likely part of either group.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should reflect the base rate.

{"probability": "0.75"}
