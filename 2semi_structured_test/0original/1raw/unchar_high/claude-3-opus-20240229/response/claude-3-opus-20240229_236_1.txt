Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description doesn't mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%. Without additional distinguishing information, this base rate is the best estimate.
