Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The description of Jason provides no information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only tells us about Jason's ability, motivation, and reputation, which could apply equally to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without any field-specific information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should simply reflect the base rates in the sample - that is, the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample of 100, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
