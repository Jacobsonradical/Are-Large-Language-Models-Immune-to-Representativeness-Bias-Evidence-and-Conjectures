To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Important points:
- The description does not provide any specific information about Jason's field of study or research.
- The personality traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, without additional information directly related to Jason's academic field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

{"probability": "0.75"}
