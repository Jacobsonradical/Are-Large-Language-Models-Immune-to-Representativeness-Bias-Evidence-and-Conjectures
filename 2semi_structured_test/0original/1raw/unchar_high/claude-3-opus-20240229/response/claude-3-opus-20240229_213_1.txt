Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common error in reasoning about probabilities.

Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, we shouldn't ignore the base rates - the fact that the original sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any other information to distinguish Jason, we should assign a 75% prior probability that any randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor, based solely on the proportions in the original sample.

The description provides no clear evidence to update this prior probability. 

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
