Given the limited information provided, there is no strong evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description of being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

Without more specific details indicating Jason's academic discipline, the most reasonable probability estimate is simply the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample of 100 professors.

Since 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is in computer science is 75%.
