Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions about Jason's field based on his description. The prior probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is in computer science is 75%, given the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

However, the description of Jason being well-liked, highly motivated, and having a positive professional reputation does not clearly distinguish whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. These traits could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information in Jason's description, I believe the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best estimated by the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 0.75.
