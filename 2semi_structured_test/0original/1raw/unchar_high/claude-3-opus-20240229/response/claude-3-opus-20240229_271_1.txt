Your question is asking me to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the limited information provided in his description.

However, there is insufficient evidence in the description to make a confident determination of Jason's field. Key relevant information that is missing includes:

- Jason's specific research areas and published work
- The department and institution where Jason is a professor  
- Any other background on Jason's education and academic career path

Without knowing more details that would indicate his specialization, we can only make a guess based on the base rates provided in the problem setup - that 75% of the full sample of professors were in computer science.

So absent other discriminating information, assigning a 75% probability would be reasonable, while acknowledging the high uncertainty.

{"probability": "0.75"}
