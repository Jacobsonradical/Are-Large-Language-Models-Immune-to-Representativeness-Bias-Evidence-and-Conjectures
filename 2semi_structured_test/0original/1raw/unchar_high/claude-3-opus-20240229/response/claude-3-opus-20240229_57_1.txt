To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's specific characteristics that might be more indicative of one field or the other, the best estimate is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This means there is a 75% chance that Jason is a computer science professor, based solely on the given information about the sample composition.
