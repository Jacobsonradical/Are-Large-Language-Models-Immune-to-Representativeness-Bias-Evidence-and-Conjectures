Your question is drawing upon the representativeness heuristic, which can lead to base rate neglect. The description of Jason fits a stereotypical view of a computer scientist, so intuitively he seems likely to be a computer science professor. However, the prior probability (base rate) that a randomly selected professor is in computer science is 75%, since 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in that field.

The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to many academics, both in computer science and humanities. Without more distinguishing information, the additional details don't strongly shift the probability away from the base rate.

Therefore, I'd estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be close to, but slightly higher than, the 75% base rate, due to the mild representativeness of the description.
