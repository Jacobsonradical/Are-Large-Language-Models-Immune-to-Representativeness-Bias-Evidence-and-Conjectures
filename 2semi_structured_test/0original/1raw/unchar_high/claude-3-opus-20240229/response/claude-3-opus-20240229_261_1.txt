In this situation, we do not have enough information to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason does not contain any details about his specific field or research interests.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if we had to guess randomly, there would be a 75% chance of Jason being a computer science professor. However, the description itself is not informative enough to sway this probability in either direction.

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
