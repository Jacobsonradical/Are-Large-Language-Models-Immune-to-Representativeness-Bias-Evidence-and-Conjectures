We should be careful not to assume Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor just because there are more computer science professors in the sample. The description given does not provide any information specific to his field. Absent other distinguishing information, the probability he is a computer science professor should simply be the base rate - the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample.

Since there are 75 computer science professors out of the 100 total, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
