To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate in the sample. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, in the absence of additional diagnostic information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate.
