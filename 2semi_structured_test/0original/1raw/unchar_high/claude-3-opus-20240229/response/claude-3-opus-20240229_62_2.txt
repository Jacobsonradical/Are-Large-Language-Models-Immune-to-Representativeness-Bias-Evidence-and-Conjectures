Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a 75% prior probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample would be a computer science professor.

Without additional information clearly indicating Jason's field, I would estimate the probability at this 75% prior probability.
