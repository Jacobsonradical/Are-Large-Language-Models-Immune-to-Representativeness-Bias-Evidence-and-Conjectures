Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions and instead reason based on the prior probabilities. The key information is:

- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
- No information is given in Jason's description that clearly identifies him as a computer science or humanities professor.

Without additional distinguishing details, the probability Jason is a computer science professor should reflect the base rates in the sample. Since 75% of the professors in the study were in computer science, this is the probability we should assign in the absence of further evidence.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
