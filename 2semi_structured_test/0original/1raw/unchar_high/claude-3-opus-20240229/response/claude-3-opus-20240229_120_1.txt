To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate itself.
