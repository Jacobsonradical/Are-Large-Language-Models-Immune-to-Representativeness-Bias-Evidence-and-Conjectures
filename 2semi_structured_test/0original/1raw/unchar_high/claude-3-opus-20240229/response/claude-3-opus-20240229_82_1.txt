Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description of being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in many fields.

However, since the sample contains 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, Jason is statistically more likely to be randomly selected from the larger group of computer science professors, assuming the description was chosen at random as stated.

Therefore, going off the base rates alone, I estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
