Given the limited information provided, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment of Jason's field of expertise. However, we can make an educated guess based on the base rates provided in the study description.

The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, if we randomly select a professor from the sample, there is a 75% chance that they would be a computer science professor, and a 25% chance they would be a humanities professor.

Since no additional information is given about Jason that would strongly indicate his field, our best estimate should be based on these base rates.
