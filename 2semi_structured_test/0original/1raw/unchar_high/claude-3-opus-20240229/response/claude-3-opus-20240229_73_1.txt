Given the limited information provided, there is no strong evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The description of being highly able, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in many fields.

However, since the original sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, the base rate alone suggests Jason is more likely to be randomly chosen from the larger group.

Therefore, based solely on the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, I'd estimate a 75% probability Jason is a computer science professor.
