You've given an interesting question, but to provide a meaningful answer I would need more information about the base rates of computer science vs. humanities professors in the overall population this sample was drawn from.

Without knowing what proportion of professors overall are in CS vs humanities, there's no way to determine if Jason is more likely to be a CS professor based just on the personality description. The description itself contains no information specific to his field.

So in this case, I don't have enough contextual information to give a numeric probability estimate. The most reasonable answer is:

{"probability": "insufficient information"}
