Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment of the probability that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

However, based on the fact that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we can start with the base rate probability:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
P(Humanities Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Without additional distinguishing information, the best estimate is to stick with this base rate.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
