To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which are:

- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science (75%)
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (25%)

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more likely to be in one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and the humanities.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
