To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's description does not explicitly mention his field of study.

Without additional information directly related to Jason's field, we can only base our probability on the distribution of professors in the study.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
