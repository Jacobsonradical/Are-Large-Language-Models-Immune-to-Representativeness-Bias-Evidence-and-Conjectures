Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we can calculate the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor at random from the sample:

P(computer science professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

Without additional distinguishing information, assigning the prior probability is a reasonable approach.

{"probability": "0.75"}
