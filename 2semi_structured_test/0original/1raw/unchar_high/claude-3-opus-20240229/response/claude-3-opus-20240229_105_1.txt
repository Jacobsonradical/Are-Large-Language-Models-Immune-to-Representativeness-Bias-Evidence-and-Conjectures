To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, rather than relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits.

In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate in the sample. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain at the base rate.
