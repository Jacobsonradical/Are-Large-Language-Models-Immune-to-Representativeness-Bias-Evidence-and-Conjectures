To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the prior probabilities based on the sample composition.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Prior probability of selecting a computer science professor: 75/100 = 0.75
Prior probability of selecting a humanities professor: 25/100 = 0.25

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study, as the traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

In the absence of additional information that would shift the probabilities, the most reasonable estimate is that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is equal to the prior probability.
