Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of 75% that a randomly selected professor from this group would be in computer science.

So in the absence of other distinguishing information, I would estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.75"}
