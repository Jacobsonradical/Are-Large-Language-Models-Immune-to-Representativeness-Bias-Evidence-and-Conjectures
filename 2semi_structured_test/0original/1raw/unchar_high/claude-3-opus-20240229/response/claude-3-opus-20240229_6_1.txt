To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates â€“ the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, our best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the base rates in the sample.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
