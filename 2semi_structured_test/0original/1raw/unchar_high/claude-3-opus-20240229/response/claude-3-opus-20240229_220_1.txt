To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would indicate his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
