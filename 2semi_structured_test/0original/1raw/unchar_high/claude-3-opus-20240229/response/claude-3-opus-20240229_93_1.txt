To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason provides no specific information to suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. His personal characteristics and reputation could apply equally to a successful computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should match the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
