To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors in the sample are in computer science
- 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are in the humanities

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
