To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of additional field-specific information, the base rate of 75% is the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
