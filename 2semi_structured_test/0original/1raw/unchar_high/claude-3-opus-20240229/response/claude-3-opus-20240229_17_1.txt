Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indications of his field of study.

However, since the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (75%) compared to a humanities professor (25%), assuming the description was indeed chosen at random.

So without any other differentiating information to go on, I would lean towards guessing Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor simply based on the higher base rate in the sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
