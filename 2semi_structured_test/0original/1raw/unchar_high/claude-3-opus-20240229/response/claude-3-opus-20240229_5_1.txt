Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate or prior probability is ignored or not given sufficient weight.

In this case, the base rate is that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to deviate from this base rate, as the traits described could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, even though the description may seem to fit a stereotypical image of a computer scientist, rationally we should still put significant weight on the base rate.

So my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
