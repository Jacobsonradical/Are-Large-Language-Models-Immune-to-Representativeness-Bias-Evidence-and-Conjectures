To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, rather than rely solely on the personality description which does not clearly distinguish between the two fields.

In the sample of 100 professors, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. Without additional distinguishing information, the probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is simply the base rate of 75%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
