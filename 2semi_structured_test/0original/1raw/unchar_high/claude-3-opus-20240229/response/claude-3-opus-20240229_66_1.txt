To answer this question, we should consider the base rates - the relative proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the overall sample.

In the study, there were:
- 75 computer science professors 
- 25 humanities professors
- For a total of 100 professors

So the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. His personality traits and description seem quite generic and could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of specific evidence pointing to computer science or humanities, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain close to the base rate of 0.75.
