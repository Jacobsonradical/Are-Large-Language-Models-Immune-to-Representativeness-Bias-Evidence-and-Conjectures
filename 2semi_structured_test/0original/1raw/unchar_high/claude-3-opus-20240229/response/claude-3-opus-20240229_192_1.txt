Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate or prior probability is ignored or not given sufficient weight.

In this case, the base rate is that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75.

The description provided does not contain any information that would sway this probability in either direction. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities.

Therefore, without more specific information suggesting otherwise, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should remain at the base rate.
