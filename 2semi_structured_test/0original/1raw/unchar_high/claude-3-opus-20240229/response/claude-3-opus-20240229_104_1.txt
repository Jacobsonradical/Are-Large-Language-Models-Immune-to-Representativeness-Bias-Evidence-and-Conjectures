To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description provided does not contain any information that would make us update our probability estimate away from the base rate. The details about Jason's age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation do not specifically indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of 0.75.
