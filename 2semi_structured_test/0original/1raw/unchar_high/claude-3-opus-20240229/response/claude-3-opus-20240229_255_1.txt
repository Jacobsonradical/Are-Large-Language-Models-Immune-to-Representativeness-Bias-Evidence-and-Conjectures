Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

Even though the description of Jason may seem to fit a stereotypical image of a computer science professor, we cannot ignore the base rates given in the question. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

So without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason as highly skilled, motivated and well-liked provides little diagnostic information to change this probability, as these traits could easily apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, even though our intuition may lean towards guessing computer science, the principled answer is to stick with the base rate probability.

{"probability": "0.75"}
