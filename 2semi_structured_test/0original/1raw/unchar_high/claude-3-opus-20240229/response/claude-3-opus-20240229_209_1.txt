To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75/100 = 0.75, or 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description is quite general and could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 75%.
