To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Key facts:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not provide any clear indication of whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor.

Without additional distinguishing information, the best we can do is assign probabilities based on the overall proportion of computer science vs. humanities professors in the sample.

Probability calculation:
P(Jason is a computer science professor) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
= 75 / 100
= 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
