Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a confident assessment of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Key points to consider:

- The overall sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other distinguishing information, the base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 75%. 

- However, Jason's description does not contain any clear indication of his field. It focuses on general traits like ability, motivation, and reputation that could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

- Jason's relatively young age of 30 as a tenured professor could potentially hint more towards computer science than humanities, but this is a very weak signal at best.

Given the lack of field-specific clues in Jason's description, I believe the base rate of 75% is the most reasonable probability estimate to give based solely on the information at hand. Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
