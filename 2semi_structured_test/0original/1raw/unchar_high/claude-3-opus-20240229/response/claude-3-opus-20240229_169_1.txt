Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

Even though the description of Jason may seem to fit a stereotypical computer science professor, we cannot ignore the base rates given in the question. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%.

The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to many successful professors, regardless of field. It doesn't provide strong evidence to substantially shift our assessment away from the base rate.

Therefore, even though the description may seem to fit a computer science professor, I would still estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be close to the base rate of 75%:

{"probability": "0.75"}
