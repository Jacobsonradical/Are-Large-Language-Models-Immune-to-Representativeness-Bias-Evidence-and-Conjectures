Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate information (i.e., the relative sizes of the subgroups in the sample) is often neglected when making probability judgments.

In this case, the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability of him being a computer science professor should be based on this base rate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is because there are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors in the sample.

The description provided about Jason does not contain any information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Thus, relying solely on the base rate information is the most rational approach in this case.
