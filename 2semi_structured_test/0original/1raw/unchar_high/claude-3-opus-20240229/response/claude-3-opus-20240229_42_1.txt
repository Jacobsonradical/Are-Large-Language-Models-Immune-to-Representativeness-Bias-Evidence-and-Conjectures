Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess, I would lean towards Jason being a computer science professor since they make up 75% of the sample. However, this is a very tentative guess with low confidence.

To represent this uncertainty, I will assign a probability of 60% to Jason being a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.60"}
