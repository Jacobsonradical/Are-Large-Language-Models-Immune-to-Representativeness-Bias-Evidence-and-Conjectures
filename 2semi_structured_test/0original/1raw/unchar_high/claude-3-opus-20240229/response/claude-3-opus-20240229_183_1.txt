To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information in the description and the base rates from the study sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description does not provide any clear indication of Jason's field of study.

Without additional field-specific information, we can only base our probability estimate on the base rates of the professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.

{"probability": "0.75"}
