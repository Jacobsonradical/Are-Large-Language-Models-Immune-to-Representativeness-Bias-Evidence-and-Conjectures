Your question is asking me to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, based only on the brief personality description provided.

However, the description does not contain any information that would allow me to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description focuses on general personality traits like ability, motivation and being well-liked, which could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Given that 75% of the professors in the overall sample are computer science professors, absent any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor is 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
