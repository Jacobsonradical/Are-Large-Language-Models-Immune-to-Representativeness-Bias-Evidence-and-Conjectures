In the absence of any information about Jason's specific field or research interests, the only information we can use is the base rate - the fact that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Given this, the probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
