To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, rather than relying solely on the description which contains no clear indication of his field.

Given:
- The sample consists of 100 professors total.
- 75 of them are computer science professors.
- 25 of them are humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
