Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to confidently determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason's personality traits and professional reputation could apply to successful professors in both fields.

However, given that the study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, there is a higher base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor, assuming the description was indeed chosen at random.

Therefore, my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based solely on the base rates in the sample, not on any specific information about Jason's field of study or expertise.
