To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The description of Jason doesn't provide any clear indication that he's more likely to be from one field or the other. He's described as capable, motivated, and well-liked, qualities that could apply equally to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing information, we should defer to the base rates. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, that should be our estimate for the probability Jason is a computer science professor.
