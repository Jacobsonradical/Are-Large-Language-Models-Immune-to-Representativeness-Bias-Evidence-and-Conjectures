To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is:

75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

Therefore, based solely on the base rates, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description could apply to a successful professor in either field.
