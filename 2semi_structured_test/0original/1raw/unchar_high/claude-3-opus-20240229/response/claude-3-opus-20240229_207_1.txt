Your question is an interesting example of how our intuitions about probability can sometimes lead us astray.

The key point is that the description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description could plausibly apply to a successful professor in either field.

Without any distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample. Since there were 75 computer science professors out of the total sample of 100, this probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is an example of the base rate fallacy - when given a description that is equally applicable to both groups, people often ignore the base rates and assign probabilities closer to 50/50. But the correct approach is to stick with the base rate in the absence of any distinguishing information.
