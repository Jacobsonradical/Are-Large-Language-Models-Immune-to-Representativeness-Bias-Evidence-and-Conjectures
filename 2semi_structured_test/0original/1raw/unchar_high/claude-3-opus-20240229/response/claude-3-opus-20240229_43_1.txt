Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions about Jason's field based on stereotypes. The prior probability of him being a computer science professor is 0.75, since 75% of the professors in the sample were in computer science. Without clear evidence that the description is more or less likely for professors in one field, we should stick close to this base rate.
