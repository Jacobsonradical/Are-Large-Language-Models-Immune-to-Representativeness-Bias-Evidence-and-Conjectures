To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(computer science) = 75/100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more likely to be from one field or the other. The details about his age, marital status, personality, and reputation do not specifically point to him being a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.
