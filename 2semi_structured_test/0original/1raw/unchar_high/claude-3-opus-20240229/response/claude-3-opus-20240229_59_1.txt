Given the limited information provided, it would be natural to guess that there is a 75% chance that Jason is a computer science professor, since 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science.

However, the description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to distinguish whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description could apply equally well to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of any distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should simply reflect the base rates in the sample, which is 75%.
