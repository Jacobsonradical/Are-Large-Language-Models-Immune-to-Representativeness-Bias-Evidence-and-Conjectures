Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying base rate (or prior probability) and focus too much on specific information that may not be as relevant.

In this case, the base rate is that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any information that would strongly suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The description could apply to a successful professor in either field.

Therefore, in the absence of field-specific information, the probability should be close to the base rate of 75% or 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
