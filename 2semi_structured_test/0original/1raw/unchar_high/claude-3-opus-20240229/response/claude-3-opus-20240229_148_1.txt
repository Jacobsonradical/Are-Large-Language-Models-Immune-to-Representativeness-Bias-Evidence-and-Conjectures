To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there were 100 professors in the sample.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would strongly indicate whether he is a computer science or humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

In the absence of additional diagnostic information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
