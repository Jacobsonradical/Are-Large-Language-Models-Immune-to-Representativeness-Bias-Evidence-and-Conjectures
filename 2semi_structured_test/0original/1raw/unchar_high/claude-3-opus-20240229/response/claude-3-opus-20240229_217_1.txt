To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, or 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any information that would strongly suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

In the absence of specific diagnostic information, it is reasonable to default to the base rate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 75%.
