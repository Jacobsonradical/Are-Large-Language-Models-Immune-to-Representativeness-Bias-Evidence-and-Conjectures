Your question is asking me to make a judgment based on representativeness - to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on how well he fits the stereotype of that group from the limited information provided.

However, the correct probability cannot be determined from the description alone. The key piece of information needed is the base rate - the fact that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is simply 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason provides no information to update this probability. It does not mention his field, and the details given could plausibly fit either a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability estimate should be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
