Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to determine with confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not contain any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess blindly, there would be a 75% chance of Jason being a computer science professor. However, the description itself is quite generic and could apply to a successful professor in any field.

Therefore, acknowledging the lack of field-specific information and maintaining an open probabilistic stance, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
