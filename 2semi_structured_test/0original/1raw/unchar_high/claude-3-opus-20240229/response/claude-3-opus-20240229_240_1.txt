Your question is drawing on concepts related to the representativeness heuristic and base rate neglect. Even though the limited information provided about Jason may seem more representative of a humanities professor, to answer the question properly we must consider the base rates given in the problem setup.

The study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So without any other information, the base rate probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%.
