Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description of Jason being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked by colleagues could apply to successful professors in either field.

However, given that the study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of 75% that a randomly selected profile would belong to a computer science professor.

So without any other distinguishing information to go on, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to simply match the base rate in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
