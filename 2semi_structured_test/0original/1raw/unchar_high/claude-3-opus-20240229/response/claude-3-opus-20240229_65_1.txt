Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the base rate information (the prior probability) and focus solely on the specific information provided.

In this case, the base rate is that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without any additional information, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75%.

However, the description of Jason does not provide any information that would allow us to update this prior probability. The description does not mention his field, research interests, or any other information that would be indicative of whether he is a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of 75%, or 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
