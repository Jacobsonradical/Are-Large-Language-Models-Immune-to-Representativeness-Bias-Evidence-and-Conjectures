Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample. So without any other information, the probability of a randomly selected person being a CS professor is 75%.

Since the personality description is rather generic and could apply to a successful professor in any field, it doesn't give us much additional information to update the base rate probability.

Therefore, I'd estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.75"}
