Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, given that the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a 75% prior probability that a randomly selected professor from the group would be in computer science.

Without additional distinguishing information, assigning the prior probability is a reasonable approach. Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
