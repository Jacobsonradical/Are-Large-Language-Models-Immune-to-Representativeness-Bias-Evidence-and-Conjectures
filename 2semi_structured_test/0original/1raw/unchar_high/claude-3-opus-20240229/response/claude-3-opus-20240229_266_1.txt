To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem. Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's personality traits that would indicate his field of study, the best estimate is to rely on the base rates. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this group is a computer science professor is 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
