To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors in the sample.

The base rate of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, or 75%.

However, the description of Jason provides no specific information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.
