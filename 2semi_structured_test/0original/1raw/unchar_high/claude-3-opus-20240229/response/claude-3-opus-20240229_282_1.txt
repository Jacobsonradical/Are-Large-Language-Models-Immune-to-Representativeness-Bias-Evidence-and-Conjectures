Your intuition may be to assign a high probability to Jason being a computer science professor, given his described high ability, strong motivation, and positive professional reputation.

However, the key is to consider the base rates given in the problem setup. We're told there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without any other identifying information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%.

So based only on the background information provided, before considering Jason's specific description, the probability would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason doesn't give any clear indication that he's more likely to be from one field or the other. The traits mentioned could apply to successful professors in many disciplines.

Therefore, lacking information to significantly shift the prior probability, a reasonable answer is to stick with that 75% prior:

{"probability": "0.75"}
