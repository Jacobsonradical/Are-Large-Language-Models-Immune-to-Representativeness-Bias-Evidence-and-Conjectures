To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- 75 of the 100 professors are in computer science
- 25 of the 100 professors are in the humanities

Without any other distinguishing information about Jason that would indicate his field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
