To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. The description doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be one or the other based on his personality traits.

Therefore, absent other distinguishing information, the probability Jason is a computer science professor should be based on the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75.
