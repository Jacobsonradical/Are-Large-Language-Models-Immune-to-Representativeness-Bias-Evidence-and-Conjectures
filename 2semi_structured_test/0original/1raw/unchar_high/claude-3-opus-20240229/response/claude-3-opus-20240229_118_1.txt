Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event and instead focus on specific details that may not be relevant.

In this case, the key information is the base rates:
- 75% of the professors in the sample are in computer science 
- 25% of the professors are in the humanities

The description of Jason does not provide any information to suggest he is more likely to be in one field or the other. His age, marital status, motivation level, and popularity with colleagues do not indicate his academic discipline.

Therefore, lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate in the overall sample, which is 0.75 or 75%.

{"probability": "0.75"}
