Your question is drawing upon concepts related to the representativeness heuristic and base rate neglect.

Given the limited information provided, the base rates are the most relevant piece of data to consider. We know that out of the 100 professors, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. Without any other differentiating information about Jason, the prior probability of him being a computer science professor is simply 75%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

It's important to note that Jason's description does not give us any strong indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Traits like being well-liked, motivated and having a positive reputation are quite generic and could apply to successful people across many fields. The description doesn't override the strong base rate of 3:1 computer science to humanities professors in the sample.
