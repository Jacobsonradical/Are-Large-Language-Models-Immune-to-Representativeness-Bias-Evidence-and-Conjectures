Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate or prior probability is ignored or underweighted.

In this case, the base rate is the fact that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. The traits described - high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, etc. - could apply to successful professors in any field.

In the absence of information specifically suggesting Jason is in one field or the other, we should defer to the base rate. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 0.75.
