Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, we can't ignore the base rates given in the setup. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

So without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%, since 75 out of the 100 professors studied were in that field.

The description of Jason is quite generic and could apply to a successful professor in many fields. It doesn't provide strong evidence to drastically shift the prior probability.

Therefore, even after reading the description, the probability Jason is a computer science professor should still be close to the base rate of 75%.

My estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}
