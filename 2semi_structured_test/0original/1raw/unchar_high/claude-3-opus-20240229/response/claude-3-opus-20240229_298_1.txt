To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should rely on the base rates provided in the study information.

The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this sample is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits mentioned, such as high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues, could apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of any field-specific information in Jason's description, the base rate of 75% should be used as the probability estimate.
