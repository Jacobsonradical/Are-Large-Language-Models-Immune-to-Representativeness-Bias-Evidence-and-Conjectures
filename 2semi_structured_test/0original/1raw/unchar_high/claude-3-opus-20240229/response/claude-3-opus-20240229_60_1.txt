Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason does not include any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

However, given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample is a computer science professor is 0.75, or 75%.

Therefore, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
