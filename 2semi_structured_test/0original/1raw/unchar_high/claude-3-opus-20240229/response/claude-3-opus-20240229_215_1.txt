Your question is drawing upon ideas related to the representativeness heuristic and base rate neglect. The base rate in this problem is that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors (75 out of 100). However, the description of Jason does not contain any information that is specifically indicative of him being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Given the lack of distinguishing information and the 75% base rate of computer science professors in the sample, the best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
