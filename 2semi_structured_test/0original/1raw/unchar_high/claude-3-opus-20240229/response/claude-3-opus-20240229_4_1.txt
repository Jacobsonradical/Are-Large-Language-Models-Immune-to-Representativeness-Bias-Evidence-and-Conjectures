To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the information provided, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In the study, there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to update this prior probability. While the description paints him as successful and well-liked, these traits could apply to professors in either field. The description does not mention any computer science specific characteristics.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, it is rational to stick with the base rate probability.
