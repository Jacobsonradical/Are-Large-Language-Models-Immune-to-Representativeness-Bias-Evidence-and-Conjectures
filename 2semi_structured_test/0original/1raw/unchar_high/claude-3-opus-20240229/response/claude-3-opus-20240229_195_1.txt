Although the description of Jason has some positive attributes that could be associated with a successful professor, there is not enough information to determine with confidence whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field of expertise.

Given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of a randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. Without additional distinguishing information, this base rate is the best estimate.
