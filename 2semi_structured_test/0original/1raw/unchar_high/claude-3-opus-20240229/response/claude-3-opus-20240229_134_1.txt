Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common error in probabilistic reasoning. To arrive at the correct probability, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description is randomly chosen from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, regardless of the specific details in the description.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 or 75%.

{"probability": "0.75"}
