Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The details about his age, marital status, lack of children, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues could apply equally to a successful professor in either field.

Without any distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
