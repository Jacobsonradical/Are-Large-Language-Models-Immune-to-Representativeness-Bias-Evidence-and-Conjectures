Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate or prior probability is ignored in favor of specific information that may not be as relevant.

In this study, there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in total. Without any other information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75, since 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample were in computer science.

The description of Jason does not provide any strong indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The traits described - being highly able, motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation - could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Therefore, in the absence of more specific diagnostic information, it is rational to stick with the base rate. My estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75:

{"probability": "0.75"}
