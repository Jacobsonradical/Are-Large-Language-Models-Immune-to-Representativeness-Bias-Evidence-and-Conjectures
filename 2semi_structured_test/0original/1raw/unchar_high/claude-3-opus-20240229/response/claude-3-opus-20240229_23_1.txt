Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event and focus on specific information. In this case, the description of Jason does not provide enough information to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75%, regardless of their description.

Without any specific information indicating Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the base rate:

{"probability": "0.75"}
