To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors in the sample are in computer science
- 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are in the humanities

The description of Jason doesn't provide any strong evidence to sway us from these base rates. While it mentions he is highly able, motivated, and well-liked, these traits could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

Therefore, lacking other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 75%.
