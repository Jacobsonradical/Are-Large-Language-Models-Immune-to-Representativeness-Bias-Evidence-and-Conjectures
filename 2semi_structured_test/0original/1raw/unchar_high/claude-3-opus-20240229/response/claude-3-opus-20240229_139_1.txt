To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates given in the problem description.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.75 or 75%.
