Your intuition may be to assume Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor, since there are more computer science professors in the sample. However, the description provided gives no information specific to Jason's field. The details about Jason's ability, motivation, and reputation would apply equally well to a professor in computer science or the humanities.

Without any distinguishing information, the probability Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate - the proportion of computer science professors in the full sample of 100.

There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total, so the probability is 75/100 = 0.75.
