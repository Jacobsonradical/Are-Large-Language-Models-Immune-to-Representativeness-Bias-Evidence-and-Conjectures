Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, a common cognitive bias.

Even though the description of Jason seems more stereotypical of a computer science professor, we cannot ignore the base rates given in the setup - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Absent any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%.

Since the description is rather generic and could apply to a successful professor in any field, it does not give us strong evidence to deviate substantially from the base rate.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
