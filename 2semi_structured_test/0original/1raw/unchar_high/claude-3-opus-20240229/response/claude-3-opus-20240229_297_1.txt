To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates - the number of computer science professors compared to humanities professors in the sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the sample, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. Without any specific information distinguishing Jason's description from the others, the probability that a randomly selected description belongs to a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description provided does not contain any information that would suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate probability.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
