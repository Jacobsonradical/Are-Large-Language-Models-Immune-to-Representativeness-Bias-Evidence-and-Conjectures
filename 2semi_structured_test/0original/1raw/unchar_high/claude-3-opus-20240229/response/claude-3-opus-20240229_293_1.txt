Your question seems to fall into a common cognitive trap known as base rate neglect or the base rate fallacy. The description of Jason provides no information that would allow us to determine whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The only relevant information given is the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

Therefore, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
