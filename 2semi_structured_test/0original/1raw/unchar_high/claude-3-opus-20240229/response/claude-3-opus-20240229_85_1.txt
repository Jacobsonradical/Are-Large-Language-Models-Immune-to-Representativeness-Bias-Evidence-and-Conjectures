To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any strong evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. His personality traits could apply to successful professors in either field.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is best estimated by the base rate.
