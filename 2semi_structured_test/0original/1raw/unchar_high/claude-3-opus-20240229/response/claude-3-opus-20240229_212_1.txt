Your question is a variation of the famous "base rate neglect" problem in probability.

Even though the description of Jason seems more stereotypically associated with a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates given in the setup. There were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without any other information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason being highly capable and well-liked doesn't actually give us much additional information to update this prior probability, since the professors were already described as successful in their respective fields. Without clearer distinguishing information, we should defer to the base rate.

This illustrates how our intuitive probability judgments can often neglect base rate information in favor of stereotypes or representativeness. But from a Bayesian perspective, the base rates are critical.
