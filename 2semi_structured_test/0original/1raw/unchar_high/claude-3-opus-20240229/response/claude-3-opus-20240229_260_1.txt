To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Out of the 100 professors in the study, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors. Without any other distinguishing information about Jason, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability is 75/100 = 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
