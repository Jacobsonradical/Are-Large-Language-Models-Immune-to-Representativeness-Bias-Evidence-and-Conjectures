To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, rather than relying solely on the personality description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any specific information in the description that clearly identifies Jason as a computer science or humanities professor, the probability that he is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
