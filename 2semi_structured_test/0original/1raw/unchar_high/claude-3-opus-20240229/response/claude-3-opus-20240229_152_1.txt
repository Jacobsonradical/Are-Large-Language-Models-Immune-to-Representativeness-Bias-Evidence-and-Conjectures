Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore overall probabilities and focus too much on specific details.

Even though Jason's description sounds like it could fit a computer science professor, to properly estimate the probability, we need to consider the base rates - there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the full sample.

Without any other information to distinguish the groups, the probability of a randomly selected person being a computer science professor is simply the base rate of 75%.

So my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
