Given the limited information provided, we should avoid making strong assumptions about Jason's field based on stereotypes. The prior probability of him being a computer science professor is 0.75, since 75% of the sample were computer science professors. His description doesn't provide clear evidence to update this prior probability. Therefore, I'll stick with the base rate as the most reasonable estimate given the information available.

{"probability": "0.75"}
