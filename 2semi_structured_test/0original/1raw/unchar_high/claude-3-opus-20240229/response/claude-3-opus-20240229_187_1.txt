To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of any randomly selected professor being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication that he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate.

So, based on the given information, my estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
