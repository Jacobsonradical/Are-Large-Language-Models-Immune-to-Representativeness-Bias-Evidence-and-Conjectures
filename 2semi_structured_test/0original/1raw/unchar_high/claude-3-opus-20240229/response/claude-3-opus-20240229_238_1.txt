To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample population.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description does not provide any specific information that would clearly identify Jason as belonging to either group.

Without additional distinguishing information, the best estimate is to base the probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
