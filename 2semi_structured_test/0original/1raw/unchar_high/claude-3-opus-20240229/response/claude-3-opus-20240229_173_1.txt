To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, rather than relying solely on the description provided. The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Using the base rates, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, without considering any additional information from the description, there is a 75% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.

The description itself does not provide strong evidence to suggest Jason is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to successful professors in various fields.
