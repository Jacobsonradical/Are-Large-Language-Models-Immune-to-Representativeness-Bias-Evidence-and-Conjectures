Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indicators of his field of study.

However, given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability that a randomly selected individual from this group would be a computer science professor.

Therefore, my estimate, based purely on the prior probabilities, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

Please note that this is a relatively uninformed guess based solely on the distribution of professors in the sample, and does not take into account any specific information about Jason himself.
