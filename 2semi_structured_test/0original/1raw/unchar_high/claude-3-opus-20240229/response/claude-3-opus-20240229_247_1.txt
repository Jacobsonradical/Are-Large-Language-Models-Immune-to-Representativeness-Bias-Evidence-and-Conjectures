Given the limited information provided, I don't believe there is enough evidence to strongly conclude whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not include any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

However, based on the study's sample sizes, there is a higher prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (75%) compared to a humanities professor (25%).

So while I don't have enough information to say with confidence, if I had to guess, I would lean towards Jason being a computer science professor simply due to the larger proportion of CS professors in the sample.

{"probability": "0.75"}
