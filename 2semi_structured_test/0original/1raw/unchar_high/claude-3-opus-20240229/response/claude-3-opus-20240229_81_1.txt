Given the limited information provided about Jason, it's difficult to make a confident assessment of the probability that he is a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor. The description does not include any clear indicators of his field. However, since the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the baseline probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample would be a computer science professor is 0.75.
