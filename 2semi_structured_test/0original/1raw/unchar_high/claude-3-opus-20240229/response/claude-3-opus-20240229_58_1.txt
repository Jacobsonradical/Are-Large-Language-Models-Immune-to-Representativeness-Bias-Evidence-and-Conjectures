Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample contained 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a 75% prior probability that a randomly selected professor from the group would be in computer science.

So without any other distinguishing information, I would estimate a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor, based purely on the base rates in the sample.
