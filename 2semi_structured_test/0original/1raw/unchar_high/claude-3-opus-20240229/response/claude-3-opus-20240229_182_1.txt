To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any additional information about Jason's specific traits that distinguish him as a computer science or humanities professor, our best estimate is the base rate.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
