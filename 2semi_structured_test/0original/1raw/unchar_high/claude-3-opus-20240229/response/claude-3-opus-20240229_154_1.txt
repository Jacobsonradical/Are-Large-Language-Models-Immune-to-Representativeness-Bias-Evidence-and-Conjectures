To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, rather than relying solely on the brief personality description provided, which does not contain enough information to make a confident judgment.

In the study, 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science, while 25 are in the humanities. Therefore, without any other distinguishing information, the prior probability of a randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

Since the description of Jason does not provide clear evidence to suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rates, the most rational probability estimate should be close to the base rate of 0.75.
