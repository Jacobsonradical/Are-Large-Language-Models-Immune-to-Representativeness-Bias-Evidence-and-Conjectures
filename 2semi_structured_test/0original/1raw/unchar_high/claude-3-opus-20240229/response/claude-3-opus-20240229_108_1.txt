Your question is asking me to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the limited information provided. However, the description of Jason does not contain any clear indicators of whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

The only relevant information given is the base rates - that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Absent any other distinguishing information about Jason, the best estimate of the probability that he is a computer science professor would simply be the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75%.

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
