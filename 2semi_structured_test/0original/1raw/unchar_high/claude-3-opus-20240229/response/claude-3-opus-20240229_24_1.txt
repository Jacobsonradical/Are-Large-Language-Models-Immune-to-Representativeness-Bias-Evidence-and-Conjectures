Based on the limited information provided in the description, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field of study.

However, given that the sample consisted of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (75%) compared to a humanities professor (25%), assuming the description was indeed chosen at random as stated.

So without any other distinguishing information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
