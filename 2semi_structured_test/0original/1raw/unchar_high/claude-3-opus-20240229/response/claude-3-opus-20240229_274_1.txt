Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate (the overall proportion of CS professors in the sample, 75%) is ignored in favor of specific information about an individual that seems relevant but is actually not very diagnostic.

The description of Jason does not contain any information that would suggest he's more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. High ability, motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues are traits that could equally apply to successful professors in both fields.

Therefore, in the absence of any truly distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to the base rate of 75% (75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in CS).
