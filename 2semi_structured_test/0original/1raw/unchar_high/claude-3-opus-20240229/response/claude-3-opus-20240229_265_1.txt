To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Given:
- 75 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in computer science.
- 25 out of the 100 professors in the sample are in the humanities.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would clearly identify him as being more likely to belong to one group or the other. The traits mentioned (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked) could apply to successful professors in both computer science and the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample, which is 75/100 = 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
