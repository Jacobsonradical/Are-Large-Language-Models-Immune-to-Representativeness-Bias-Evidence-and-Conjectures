Given the limited information provided, it would be imprudent to make a confident judgment about Jason's field of expertise. The description does not contain any clear indicators of whether he is a computer science or humanities professor.

The base rate in the sample is 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors. Absent other disambiguating information, the most reasonable probability estimate is this base rate.
