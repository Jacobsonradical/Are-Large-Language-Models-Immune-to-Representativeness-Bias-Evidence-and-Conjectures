To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.

Without any additional information about Jason's specific characteristics that might be more strongly associated with one field or the other, the best estimate we can make is based on the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

The probability that a randomly selected professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, given the limited information provided, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75 or 75%.
