To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions.

Without any additional information specifically identifying Jason as a computer science professor, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is 0.75 or 75%.
