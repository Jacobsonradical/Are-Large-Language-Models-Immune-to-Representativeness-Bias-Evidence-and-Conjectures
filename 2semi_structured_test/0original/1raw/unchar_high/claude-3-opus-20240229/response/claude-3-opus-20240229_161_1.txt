You asked me to provide the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description. However, there is not enough information in the description to determine the probability with any certainty. The description does not mention Jason's field of study at all.

Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, if I had to guess based only on the prior probabilities, I would estimate a 75% probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is in computer science.

However, this would be an arbitrary guess that ignores the actual details provided about Jason. The correct probability cannot be determined from the information given.
