To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should rely on the information provided about the base rates of professors in each field, rather than making a judgment based on the personality description which does not contain information specific to his field.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

Therefore, without any other distinguishing information, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

So my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
