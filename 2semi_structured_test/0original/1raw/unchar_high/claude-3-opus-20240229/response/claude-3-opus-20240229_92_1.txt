Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description of Jason does not include any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

Given that the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of a randomly selected individual from the sample being a computer science professor is 0.75.

In the absence of additional field-specific information, the prior probability is the best estimate.
