Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy. While the description provides some information about Jason's personality, it does not contain any information specific to his field. The only relevant information for calculating the probability is the base rates - there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

Therefore, lacking any other distinguishing information, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this sample is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
