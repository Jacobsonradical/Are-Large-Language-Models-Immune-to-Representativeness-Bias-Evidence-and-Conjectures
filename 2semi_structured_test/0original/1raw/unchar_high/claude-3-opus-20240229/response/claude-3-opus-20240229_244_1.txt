Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event and focus too much on the specific information provided.

In this case, the key information is that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any other distinguishing information, the probability of a randomly selected person from this group being a computer science professor is 75%.

The description of Jason does not provide any information that would suggest he is more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Therefore, the base rate of 75% should be used as the probability estimate.

{"probability": "0.75"}
