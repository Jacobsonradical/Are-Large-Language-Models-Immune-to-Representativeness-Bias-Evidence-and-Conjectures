Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a confident assessment of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. The description does not contain any clear indications of his specific field.

However, since the overall sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the baseline probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample would be a computer science professor is 0.75.

In the absence of additional distinguishing information, this baseline probability is the most reasonable answer.

{"probability": "0.75"}
