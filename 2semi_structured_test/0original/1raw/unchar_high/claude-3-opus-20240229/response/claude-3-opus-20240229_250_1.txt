Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy, where people tend to ignore the underlying probability of an event in the overall population.

In this case, even though Jason's description seems quite generic and could apply to professors from both groups, the key is that 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors (75 out of 100).

So without any other distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be close to that base rate of 75%.

{"probability": "0.75"}
