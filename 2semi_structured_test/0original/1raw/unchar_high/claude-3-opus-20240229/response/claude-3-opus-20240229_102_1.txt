To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should avoid relying on stereotypes or assumptions about personality traits associated with different fields. The correct approach is to look at the base rates: there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without any additional distinguishing information, the probability of Jason being a randomly selected computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
