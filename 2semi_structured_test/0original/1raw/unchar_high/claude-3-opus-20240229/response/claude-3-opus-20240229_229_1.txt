Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy, where the base rate information (the proportion of professors from each field) is often neglected in favor of specific information about an individual that may not be very diagnostic.

Given that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75%. However, the description of Jason does not provide any information that would strongly suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. The description could apply to a successful professor in either discipline.

Therefore, in the absence of truly distinguishing information, the base rate is the best guide. My estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
