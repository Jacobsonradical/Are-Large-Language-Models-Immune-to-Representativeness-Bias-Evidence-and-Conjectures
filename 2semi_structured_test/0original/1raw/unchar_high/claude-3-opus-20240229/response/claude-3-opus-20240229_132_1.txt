To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, rather than relying solely on the description provided.

Given:
- The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description does not provide clear evidence to distinguish whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor.

Using the base rates, the probability that a randomly chosen professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75, based on the composition of the sample.
