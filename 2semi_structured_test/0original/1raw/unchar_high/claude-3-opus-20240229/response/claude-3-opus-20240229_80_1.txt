To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which are 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors.

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be from one field or the other. His personal characteristics such as age, marital status, ability, motivation, and reputation among colleagues could apply equally to professors in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of field-specific information, the best estimate of the probability is the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
