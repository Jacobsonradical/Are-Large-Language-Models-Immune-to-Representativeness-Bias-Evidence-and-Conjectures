To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description was randomly chosen from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is:

P(Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The description itself does not provide any specific information that would make us update this probability. Jason's personality traits, age, marital status, and lack of children do not give us any strong indication of his field of study.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
