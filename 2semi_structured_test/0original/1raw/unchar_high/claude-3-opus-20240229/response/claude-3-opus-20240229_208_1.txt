Based on the limited information provided, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not contain any details about his specific field of study or research interests.

However, given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability that a randomly selected individual from the sample would be a computer science professor.

Therefore, if I had to estimate the probability based solely on the base rates in the sample, my answer would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This reflects the fact that 75% of the professors in the study are from computer science. However, I want to emphasize that this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information, and should not be taken as a definitive assessment of Jason's likely field of study.
