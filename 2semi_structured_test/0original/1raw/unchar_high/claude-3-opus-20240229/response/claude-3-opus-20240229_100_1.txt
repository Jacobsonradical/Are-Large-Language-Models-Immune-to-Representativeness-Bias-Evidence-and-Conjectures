Jason's description does not provide strong evidence that he is more likely to be a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. The description is quite generic and could apply to successful professors in many fields.

However, we do need to consider the base rates in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. Without any other distinguishing information, the probability Jason is a computer science professor should match the base rate of 75%.
