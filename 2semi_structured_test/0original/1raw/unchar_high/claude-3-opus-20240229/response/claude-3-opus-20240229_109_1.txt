To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information.

Key facts:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description of Jason does not provide any clear indication of his field of study.

Given that we have no specific information about Jason's field, we can base our probability estimate on the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor:
75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, without additional distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
