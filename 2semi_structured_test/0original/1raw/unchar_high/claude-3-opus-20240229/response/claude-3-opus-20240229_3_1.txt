To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates in the sample, which has 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors.

The description doesn't provide any clear evidence to suggest Jason is more likely to be from one field or the other. His traits of high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues could apply equally to successful professors in computer science or the humanities.

In the absence of distinguishing evidence, we should defer to the base rates. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are computer science professors, the probability that a randomly selected individual (Jason in this case) is a computer science professor is 0.75.
