Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field.

However, since the sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, assuming the description was selected at random.

Therefore, based only on the prior probabilities, I estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This reflects the baseline 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description. More specific information about his field of study would be needed to deviate from this prior probability.
