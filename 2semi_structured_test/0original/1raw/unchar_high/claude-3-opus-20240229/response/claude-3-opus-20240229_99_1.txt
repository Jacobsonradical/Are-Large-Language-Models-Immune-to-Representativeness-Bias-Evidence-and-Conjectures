Based on the limited information provided, there is not enough evidence to determine with confidence whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description does not mention his specific field or any other distinguishing characteristics that would allow us to make an informed guess.

Given that the overall sample contains 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors, if we had to estimate a probability without any other information to go on, assigning the base rate probability would be most reasonable.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
