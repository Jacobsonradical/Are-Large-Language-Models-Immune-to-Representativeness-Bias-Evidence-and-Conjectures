Your question is an example of the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect.

The description of Jason provides no information that would indicate whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The description only gives generic positive traits that could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Without any distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the base rate of computer science professors in the overall sample, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
