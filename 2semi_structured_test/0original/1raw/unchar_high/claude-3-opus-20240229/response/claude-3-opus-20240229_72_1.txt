Your question is a great example of the base rate fallacy. Even though the description of Jason may sound like it fits a computer science professor, we cannot ignore the base rates - the fact that the sample contains 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors.

Without any other information to distinguish Jason, we should assign a 75% probability that he is a computer science professor, simply based on the proportions in the sample.
