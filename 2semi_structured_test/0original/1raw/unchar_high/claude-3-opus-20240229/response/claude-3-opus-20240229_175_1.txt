To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates given in the problem. The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without any additional distinguishing information about Jason's field, the probability that he is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 or 75%.
