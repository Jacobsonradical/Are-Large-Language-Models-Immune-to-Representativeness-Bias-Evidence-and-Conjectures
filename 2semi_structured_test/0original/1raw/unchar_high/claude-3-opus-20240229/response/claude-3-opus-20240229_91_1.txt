To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the available information:

- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- The description provided does not contain any information specifically related to Jason's field of study.

Without additional information directly linking Jason to either field, we can only base our probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
            = 75 / 100
            = 0.75

Therefore, given the limited information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
