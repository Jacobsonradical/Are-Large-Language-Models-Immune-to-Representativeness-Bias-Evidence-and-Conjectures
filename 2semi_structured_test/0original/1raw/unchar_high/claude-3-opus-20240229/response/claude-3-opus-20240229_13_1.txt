To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the base rates - the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:
P(Computer Science Professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would make him more or less likely to be a computer science professor compared to the base rate. Therefore, our best estimate is the base rate probability.

{"probability": "0.75"}
