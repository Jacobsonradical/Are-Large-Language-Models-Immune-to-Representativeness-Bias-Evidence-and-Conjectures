Your description provides no information to determine whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The prior probability based on the study's sample is 0.75, since 75 out of the 100 professors studied were in computer science. But the description of Jason being well-liked, motivated and having a good professional reputation could equally apply to a successful professor in either field. Therefore, in the absence of any distinguishing information, the probability remains at the prior of 0.75.
