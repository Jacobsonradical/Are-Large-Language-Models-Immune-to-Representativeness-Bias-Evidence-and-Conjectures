To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use a straightforward application of Bayes' theorem. We know the following:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

So, the total number of professors is 100.

Since Jason is chosen at random from these professors, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that he is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability \( P(Humanities) \) that he is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that we have no specific information in the description that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:

\[ P(CS | Description) \approx \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:
