Given the base rates provided by the study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. This means there's a 75% (0.75) chance that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science and a 25% (0.25) chance that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities. 

The information about Jason—such as his age, marital status, professional traits, and reputation—does not significantly differentiate between the computer science and humanities professors in a way that would affect the probabilities. Thus, we rely on the base rates given.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
