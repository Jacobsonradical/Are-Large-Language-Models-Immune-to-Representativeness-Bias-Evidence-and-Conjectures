Given the initial setup, we know that there are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, the probability that randomly selected Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the ratio of CS professors to the total number of professors.

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Total number of professors: 100 (75 CS + 25 Humanities)
2. Probability that Jason is a CS professor:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{
"probability": "0.75"
\}
