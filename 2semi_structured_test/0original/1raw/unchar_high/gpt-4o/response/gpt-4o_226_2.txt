To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. Given that Jason could be either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we need to factor in the proportion of each group in the sample along with any distinguishing characteristics provided in the description. 

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability Jason is a computer science professor, P(CS): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability Jason is a humanities professor, P(Hum): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Since no specific characteristic in the description highly distinguishes between the two groups, let's assume the likelihood of the description fitting either a computer science professor or a humanities professor is relatively similar.

Given these proportions and the lack of distinguishing characteristics in the description, we can calculate the posterior probability using the prior probabilities. 

Therefore, based on Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Due to the lack of additional distinguishing information in the description, we'll simplify it to the prior probability:

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
