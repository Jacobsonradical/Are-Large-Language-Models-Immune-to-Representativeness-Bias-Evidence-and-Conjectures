To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to establish the prior probability for each field. 

There are 100 professors in total: 75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities.

The prior probability (P) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability (P) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided about Jason includes common traits but no unique identifiers specific to either discipline, we assume it applies equally to professors in both fields. Therefore, the likelihood (based on the description alone) that Jason is from either field remains equivalent to the prior probabilities.

Given no additional distinguishing information favoring one field over the other, the posterior probability remains aligned with the prior probability for each field.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.75"\}} \]
