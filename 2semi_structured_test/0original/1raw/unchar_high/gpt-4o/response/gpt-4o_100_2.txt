Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, the proportion of computer science professors in the sample is 75/100, or 0.75.

Without any additional specific distinguishing information provided in the description of Jason that would strongly indicate that he is more likely to be in one field over the other, the base rate alone would guide the estimation.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be reasonably estimated based on this base rate:

{"probability": "0.75"}
