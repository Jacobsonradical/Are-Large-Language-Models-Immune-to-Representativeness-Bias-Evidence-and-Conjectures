To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the composition of the entire sample. The total sample size is 100, composed of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. With no additional distinguishing information about Jason that might suggest one field over the other, the initial prior probabilities are based on their relative proportions in the sample.

The probability (P) can be calculated using basic proportional reasoning:

\[ P(\text{computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
