To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. The basic idea is to update our initial probability (prior) with the likelihood of the observed description (evidence).

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to consider that the description applies to any professor, regardless of their field. Since we do not have specific information about the likelihood of the description for each field, we will assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields.

So, the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) = 1 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

And,
\[ P(H|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})
