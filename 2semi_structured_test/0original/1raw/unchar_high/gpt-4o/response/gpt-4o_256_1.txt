To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

Firstly, we have the following information:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- From this, the prior probability (P(CS)) of a professor being from computer science is 75/100, and the prior probability (P(H)) of a professor being from the humanities is 25/100.

Now, to apply Bayes' Theorem, we need:
- P(C) = P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(D|C) and P(D|H), which are the probabilities of having the description Jason has given he is from computer science or humanities.

In the absence of specific distinguishing features in the description that would favor one group over the other, we might assume P(D|C) and P(D|H) are approximately equal. If we assume they are equal, the likelihood ratio becomes 1, and the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the posterior probability, P(CS|D), which is the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS) \cdot P(D|CS)}{ P(CS
