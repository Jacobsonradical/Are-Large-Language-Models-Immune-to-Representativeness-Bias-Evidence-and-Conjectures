Given the ratio of computer science professors (75) to humanities professors (25) in the study, it seems logical to use this prior distribution to determine the probability. Since the description provided does not contain information that clearly distinguishes between the two fields, we rely on the initial ratio.

The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is:
\( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

I will respond in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
