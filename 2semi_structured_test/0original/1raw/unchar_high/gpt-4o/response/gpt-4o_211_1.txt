To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being true for a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that the description is fairly general and doesn't provide specific traits that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\bar{A}) \) are approximately equal. Therefore, the prior probabilities will primarily guide our answer:

- \( P(A) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\bar{A}) \) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample:
\[ P(\bar{A}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\bar{A}) \), we can simplify
