The description of Jason does not provide information specific enough to clearly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. However, using the base rates given in the study (75% are computer science professors and 25% are humanities professors), we can apply Bayes' theorem, but in this case, since the description doesn't differentiate, we'll rely on base rates.

Given:

- 75 computer science professors (75%)
- 25 humanities professors (25%)

Using only the base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 75%.

Thus,

{"probability": "0.75"}
