"probability": "0.75"

Here's the reasoning: The study sample comprises 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and a humanities professor \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \). 

The description provided for Jason does not contain specific information that would significantly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors; it contains neutral traits regarding profession. Therefore, the Bayesian update to the prior probability doesnâ€™t notably shift due to the lack of additional distinguishing evidence. Accordingly, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains aligned with the prior probability of 0.75.
