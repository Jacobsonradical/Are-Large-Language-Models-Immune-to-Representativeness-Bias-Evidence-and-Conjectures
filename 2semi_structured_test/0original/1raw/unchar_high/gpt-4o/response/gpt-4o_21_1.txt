To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define some terms:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), where \( D \) is the description given.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming that the description does not favor either of the two groups disproportionately (i.e., it is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors), we can use the base rates:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description is given and we assume that the probability of the description for a computer science professor is the same as for a humanities professor (\( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \)), the final probability primarily relies on the base rates:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P
