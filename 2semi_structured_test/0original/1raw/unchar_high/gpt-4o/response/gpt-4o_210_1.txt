To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the relative proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Without any additional information distinguishing between the two groups, we use these priors to estimate the probability.

The probability that Jason is from the computer science group can be calculated as follows:

P(ComputerScience|Description) = Number of Computer Science Professors / Total Number of Professors
= 75 / 100
= 0.75

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
