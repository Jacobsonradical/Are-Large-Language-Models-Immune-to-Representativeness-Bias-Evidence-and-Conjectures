To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since we don't have information that differentiates between descriptions of computer science professors and humanities professors, we assume that every professor has an equal chance of having any given description.

Let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The probability of drawing a description at random doesn't depend on the field if the descriptions are equally distributed among the fields.

So,

\[ P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = \frac{1}{100} \]

Since they are equally likely, we can simplify to:

\[ P(\text{description}) = 1 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \cdot 0.75
