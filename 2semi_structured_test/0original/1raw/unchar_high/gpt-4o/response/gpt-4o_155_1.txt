To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of each category and the likelihood of the observed evidence under each category.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.

We're interested in \( P(C | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we do not have specific information about how the personality descriptions correlate directly with being a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Thus:
\[ P(\text{description} | C) \approx P(\text{description} | H) \]

This assumption simplifies the Bayes' theorem equation because the \( P(\text{description}) \
