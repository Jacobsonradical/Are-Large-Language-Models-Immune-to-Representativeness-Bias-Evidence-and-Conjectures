To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we must consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample: computer science professors and humanities professors.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Since the description does not provide any specific information that distinguishes a computer science professor from a humanities professor, we rely on the base rates.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
