Given the information provided and understanding the base rates in the sample:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Since we are selecting Jason's description at random, we can use the base rates to calculate the probability. The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that we know nothing else specific about him, is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability, P(CS), is:
P(CS) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
       = 75 / 100
       = 0.75

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
