Given the information, we need to evaluate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

Let's denote the following:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We know from the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description of Jason, we need to update these probabilities. However, the description provided does not strongly favor one group over the other since it simply mentions personal characteristics (e.g., high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) without specific reference to attributes more likely for one discipline over the other.

In the absence of additional information that would make the description more typical of one group compared to the other, we default to relying on the base rates alone. This is a common approach in such base-rate problems.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the base rate of computer science professors.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
