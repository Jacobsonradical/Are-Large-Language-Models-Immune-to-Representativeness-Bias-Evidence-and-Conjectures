To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

First, let's summarize the information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason is described in a way that must be common among both groups.

Now, let's compute the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is the proportion of computer science professors out of the total:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given that the description provided does not include any information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we don't have any basis to update these probabilities further. Therefore, we should use the prior probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

\[
\{\text{"probability": "0.75"}\}
\]

Therefore, the formatted answer is:

\[
\{\text{"probability": "
