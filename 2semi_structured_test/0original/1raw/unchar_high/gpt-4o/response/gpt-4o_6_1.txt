{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from the fact that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and there is no sign in the description of Jason that indicates a particular field preference. Therefore, the probability is based on the proportion of the professors in the sample belonging to each field. 

Probability (Jason is a computer science professor) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors 
= 75 / 100 
= 0.75
