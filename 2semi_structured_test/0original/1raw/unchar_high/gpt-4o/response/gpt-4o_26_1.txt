To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample. 
The total number of descriptions is 100. 
There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, P(CS), is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, P(H), is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, we need to consider how likely it is that such a description would apply to computer science professors versus humanities professors. However, since we do not have specific information on the probabilities of these traits given the field (P(description | CS) or P(description | H)), we can assume that the description is equally likely to apply to professors from either field. This assumption allows us to proceed with the prior probabilities as the best estimate.

Therefore, under the assumption of equal likelihood of the description being applicable to any professor, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability is:
