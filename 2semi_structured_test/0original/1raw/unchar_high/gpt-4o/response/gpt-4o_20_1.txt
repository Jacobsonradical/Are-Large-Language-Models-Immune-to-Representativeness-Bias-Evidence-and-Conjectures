Given that we have 100 professors in total, with 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \) = The given description of Jason

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the sample sizes:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

If we assume that the description does not favor either discipline
