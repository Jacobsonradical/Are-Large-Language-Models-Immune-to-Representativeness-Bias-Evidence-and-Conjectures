To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Given the setup of the problem, we have:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the total number of professors is 100.

Since no specific information that strongly distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors is given in the description, the prior probability is essentially the proportion of each group in the sample.

The prior probability that Jason is from the computer science group is:

\[ \text{P(Computer Science)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, in the absence of any distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
