To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given about Jason.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \).

First, we will determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} \).
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Since the description doesn't favor either group and we don't have specific information suggesting one more likely than the other, we may assume a neutral probability, say 1 (assuming equal likelihood given successful tenure and positive reputation are common identifiers).
