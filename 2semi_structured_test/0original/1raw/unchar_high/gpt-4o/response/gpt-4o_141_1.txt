Given the problem setup and the description provided, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given data.

First, let's start with the base rates:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 100.

Now we need to recognize that the description of Jason does not provide specific differentiators between computer science professors and humanities professors. Therefore, in the absence of specific biases toward either group in the description, we should rely on the base rates provided.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayes' rule that, in this specific context without further differentiating information, simplifies to the ratio of the group sizes:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})}
\]

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{75/100}{75/100 + 25/100} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
