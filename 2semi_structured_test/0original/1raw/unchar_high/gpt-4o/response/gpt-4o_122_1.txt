To determine the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, but given the problem's structure and lack of specific differentiating details, we can approach it with simple prior probabilities.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probability that the randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that the professor is from humanities is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that the description doesn't give us any information specifically distinguishing between computer science and humanities, we can stick with these prior probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
