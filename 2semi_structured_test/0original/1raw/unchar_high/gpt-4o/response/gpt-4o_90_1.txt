To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the number of professors from each discipline in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability of picking a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that there is no additional information in Jason's description that specifically favors one discipline over the other, we should rely on these priors. Therefore, we assume that the likelihood of the description being equally likely for professors in both groups.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
