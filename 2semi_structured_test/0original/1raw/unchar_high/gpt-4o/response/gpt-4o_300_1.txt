{"probability": "0.75"}

To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. The problem provides us with the following information:
- The total number of professors: 100
- The number of computer science professors: 75
- The number of humanities professors: 25

Without any additional information that distinguishes Jason's field, we will assume that each description is equally likely to describe someone from either field. Thus, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75 out of 100, or 0.75 (since 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science).
