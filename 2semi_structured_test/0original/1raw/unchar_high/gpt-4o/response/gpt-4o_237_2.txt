To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates and any clues provided by the description.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the base rate probabilities:
- Probability of being a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without any additional specific information favoring one group over the other, the probability is due initially to the base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
