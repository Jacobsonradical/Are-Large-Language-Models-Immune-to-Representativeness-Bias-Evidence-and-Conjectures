To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's first consider the base rates. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description given does not provide specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we will rely on these base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains as the base rate, which is 0.75.
