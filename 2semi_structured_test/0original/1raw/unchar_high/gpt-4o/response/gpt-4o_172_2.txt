Given the provided description and the structure of the sample:

1. The total number of professors is 100.
2. Out of these, 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Since the description does not provide specific details that distinctly differentiate between a computer science and humanities professor, we will assume that the information does not favor one discipline over the other. Therefore, the prior probabilities will be used to infer the likelihood.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, we assume that the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 given the lack of distinguishing information.
