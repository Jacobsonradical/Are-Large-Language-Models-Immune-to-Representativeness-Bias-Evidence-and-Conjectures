To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{\ "probability": "0.75" }
