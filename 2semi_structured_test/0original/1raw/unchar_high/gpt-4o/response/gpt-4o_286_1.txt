To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem and consider the base rates of each group.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description provided could equally describe a professor in either field and there is no information that favors one over the other, we assume that such description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally likely for professors in either group.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS|Info) = \frac{P(Info|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Info)} \]

Given that \( P(Info|CS) \approx P(Info|Hum) \), and they are derived from equal likelihood:

\[ P(Info) = P(Info|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Info|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) 
= k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.
