Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, any randomly chosen professor has a higher prior probability of being from the computer science group simply based on the sample sizes. Without additional specific information that distinguishes Jason as more likely to belong to one group over the other, we rely on the base rates.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

P(CS | Description) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors
                        = 75 / 100
                        = 0.75

Therefore, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
