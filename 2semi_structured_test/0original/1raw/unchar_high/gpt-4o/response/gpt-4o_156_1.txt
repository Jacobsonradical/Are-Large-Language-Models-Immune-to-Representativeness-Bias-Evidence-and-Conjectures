Let's use Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description.

First, let's define the hypotheses:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Next, we need:
1. The prior probabilities:
   - \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

2. The likelihoods of the description given each hypothesis:
   - \( P(D | H_{CS}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | H_{H}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
  
Since we lack specific information differentiating descriptions of computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume the descriptions are equally likely for professors from both fields. Hence, \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(D | H_{H}) \) can be considered equal for simplicity.

To find the posterior probability \( P(H_{CS} | D) \
