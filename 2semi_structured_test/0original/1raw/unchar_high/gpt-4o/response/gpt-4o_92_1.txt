To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The provided description of Jason.

We want to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, recall that:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so the prior probabilities are:
  - \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
  - \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to consider \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\), the likelihoods of the description given each type of professor. Since we don't have specific details about how the descriptions were generated, we'll assume that the description fits similarly across both groups. Therefore, we consider \(P(D|C) \approx P(D|H)\).

Given Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

\(P(D)\) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H
