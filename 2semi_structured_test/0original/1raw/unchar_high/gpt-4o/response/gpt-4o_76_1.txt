To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample. 

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The total number of professors is 100.

So, the proportion of computer science professors is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that no additional distinguishing information is provided in the description, we can use this proportion as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Thus, the probability is:
\[ 0.75 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
