To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The relevant information provided is:

- 75 computer science professors in the sample
- 25 humanities professors in the sample

We are given a description of Jason but no specific details to distinguish whether he belongs to one group or the other. Therefore, we assume there is no difference in the likelihood of this description arising from either group.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability \(P(CS | J)\) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(J\) is:

\[ P(CS | J) = \frac{P(J | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(J)} \]

Since \(P(J | CS)\) and \(P(J | H)\) (where \(H\) represents humanities professors) are assumed equal due to lack of distinguishing information, they cancel out, simplifying our calculation to the ratio of the base rates:

\[ P(CS | J) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

With the base rates:

- \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

So:

\[ P(CS | J) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25
