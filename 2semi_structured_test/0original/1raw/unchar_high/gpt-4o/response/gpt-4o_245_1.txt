To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample compared to the total.

The sample consists of:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

So, the total number of professors in the study is:
75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100 (total)

Given that Jason's description was chosen at random from these 100 professors, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be determined by the ratio of computer science professors in the sample to the total number.

The probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
