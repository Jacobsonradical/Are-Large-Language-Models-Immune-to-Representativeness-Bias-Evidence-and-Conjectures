Given that the description provided is chosen at random among the 100 descriptions available, and considering the sample sizes from each group (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We begin by calculating the prior probabilities:
- Probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since no additional distinguishing features in the description favor one group over the other, we assume equal likelihood given the description for both groups.

Therefore, applying the prior probabilities, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\( P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = 0.75 \)

So the probability can be stated as follows:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
