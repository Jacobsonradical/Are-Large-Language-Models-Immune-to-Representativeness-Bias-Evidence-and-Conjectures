Based on the description of Jason, we need to evaluate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors compared to the probability that he is one of the humanities professors. Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, without any additional distinguishing details, the base rate (or prior probability) is determined by the ratio of the two groups.

Here are the key points:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The base rate probability of randomly picking a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{75}{75 + 25} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, without additional details differentiating Jason from typical professors in each field, the most straightforward answer relies on these base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
