To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we start with the base rates provided in the study. Specifically, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Given that Jason is picked at random from the 100 descriptions, the base probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ 
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

This is a straightforward application of the base rate, as we do not have additional statistical differentiators based on the description provided.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{
"probability": "0.75"
}
