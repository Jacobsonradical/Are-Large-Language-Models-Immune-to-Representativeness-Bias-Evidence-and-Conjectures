To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem involves computing the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

### Provided Data:
- Total number of professors = 100
- Professors in computer science = 75
- Professors in humanities = 25

### Steps to Calculate:
1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   Without additional specific traits unique to computer science or humanities professors provided in the description of Jason, we assume the description might uniformly apply to either group. Hence, the likelihood (or the probability of the description given the profession) is the same for both groups. 

3. **Posterior Calculation (Using Bayes' Theorem):**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]
   - P(D|CS) = likelihood of description given computer science professor
   - P(D|H) = likelihood of description given humanities professor
   Since we assume
