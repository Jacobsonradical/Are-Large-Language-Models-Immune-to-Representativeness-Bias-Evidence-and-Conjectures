To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the key components we need to use:

- Number of computer science professors (\(C\)): 75
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)): 25
- Total number of professors (\(T\)): 100

We are looking for \(P(C|D)\): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

Firstly, since we don't have specific information that distinguishes the likelihood of the description between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields. This simplifies our calculation because \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are equal.

Given the counts:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description is equally likely, \(P
