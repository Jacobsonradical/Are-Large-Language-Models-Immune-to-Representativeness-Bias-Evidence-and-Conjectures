Given the description of Jason, it is challenging to infer his field based solely on personality traits, as these characteristics are generally positive and could be applicable to many successful individuals in either computer science or the humanities.

So, let's use the information provided about the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the probability that a random professor from the sample is a computer science professor is found by dividing the number of computer science professors by the total number of professors:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given no additional distinguishing information, this would be our best estimate for the probability.

Here is the answer in the required format:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
