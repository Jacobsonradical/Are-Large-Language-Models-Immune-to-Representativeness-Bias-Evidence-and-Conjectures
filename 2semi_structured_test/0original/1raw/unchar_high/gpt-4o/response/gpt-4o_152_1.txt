To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates of each group:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the total number of professors is 100.

The probability of selecting a computer science professor is calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given we lack additional specific information about Jason that distinguishes him clearly as belonging to one of the two groups, we baseline estimate based purely on initial group proportions.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\frac{75}{100}\), or 0.75.
