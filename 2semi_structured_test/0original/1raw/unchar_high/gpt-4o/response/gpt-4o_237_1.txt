To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem considering the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.

We're looking for \( P(\text{Jason is in computer science}|\text{Description}) \).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without additional specific information from the description that would favor one group over the other, we assume that the description applies similarly to both groups of professors. Thus, the likelihood of the description given computer science or humanities would be approximately equal.

This leads to:
\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \approx P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is common for both and the likelihoods are approximately equal, the posterior probability mainly
