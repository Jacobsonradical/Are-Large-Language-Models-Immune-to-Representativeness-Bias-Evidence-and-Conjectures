To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Assuming the description applies equally likely to professors in both fields (since no specific traits were given indicating a stronger fit with either field), the likelihoods are:
   - Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \approx 1 \)
   - Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \approx 1 \)

3. **Normalization Factor**:
   - Total probability of the description: \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \)

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem: \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
