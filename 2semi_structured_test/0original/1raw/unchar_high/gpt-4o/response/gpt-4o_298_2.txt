To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of each group and the fact that the description could apply to professors from either discipline.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The total number of professors is 100.

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use the following formula:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
