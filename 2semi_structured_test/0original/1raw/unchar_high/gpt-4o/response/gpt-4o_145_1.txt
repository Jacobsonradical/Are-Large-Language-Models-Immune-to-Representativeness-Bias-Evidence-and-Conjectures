To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is 75 out of 100, or:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \), is 25 out of 100, or:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let \( E \) be the event that a professor matches Jason's description. To find \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \), we would need further specifics, but given the lack of differential information provided, for simplicity, we'll assume these probabilities are the same because the description is fairly neutral and could apply equally to professors in both fields.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(E | CS) \times P(CS) + P(E | H)
