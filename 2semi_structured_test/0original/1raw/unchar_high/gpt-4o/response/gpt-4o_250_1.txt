Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, it's important to consider the base rates provided in the sample. Without any specific traits that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors in this description, the probability is purely based on these base rates.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P(CS|Jason) = \frac{P(Jason|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(CS) \cdot P(Jason|CS) + P(H) \cdot P(Jason|H)} \]

Here \( P(Jason|CS) \) and \( P(Jason|H) \) are assumed to be the same since the description doesn't provide distinctive traits to differentiate between the fields.

So, we simplify it to:

\[ P(CS|Jason) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{\frac{75}{100}}{\frac{75}{100} + \frac{25}{100}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, 
{"probability": "0.75"}
