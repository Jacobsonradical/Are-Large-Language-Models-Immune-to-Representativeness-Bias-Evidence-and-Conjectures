To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem calculates the posterior probability of an event based on prior probabilities and the likelihood of the current evidence.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
   - The prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The prior probability (P(H)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description provided gives details about Jason's personality, but does not provide any specific information that would alter the likelihood differently for computer science professors versus humanities professors. Therefore, we assume the likelihood (P(description|CS) and P(description|H)) of Jason having this personality description is equal for both fields.

3. **Posterior probability:**
   - Given that the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability remains proportional to the prior probabilities.

\[ 
P(CS|description) = \frac{P(CS) \cdot P(description|CS)}{P(CS) \cdot P(description|CS) + P(H) \cdot P(description|H)}
\]
