{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the information in the study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the probability of any professor being from computer science 75 out of 100, or 0.75. This baseline probability applies given that the description of Jason doesnâ€™t provide specific information that would differentiate between the two fields significantly. So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
