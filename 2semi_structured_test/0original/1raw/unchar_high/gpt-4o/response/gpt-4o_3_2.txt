To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use the principle of base rates, which takes into account the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample. Here's how we can calculate it:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. This means the total number of professors is 100.

The base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is therefore:
\[ \text{Probability(Jason is a computer science professor)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional information to differentiate Jason and considering the description given doesn't seem to favor one discipline over the other significantly, it is reasonable to rely on the base rates directly.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
