Given that we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the total pool of 100, we start with our base probabilities. The base probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75%, and from the humanities is 25%.

The description of Jason does not provide any obvious information that would lead us to update these initial base probabilities one way or another. It is reasonable to assume that the characteristics described could apply equally to professors in both fields.

Therefore, the base rate remains the most significant factor driving our probability estimation.

Given the lack of distinguishing features in the description, we can infer the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors using these base rates.
