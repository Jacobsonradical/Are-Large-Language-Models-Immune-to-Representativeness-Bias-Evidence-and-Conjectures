To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be simplified by considering the base rates (the initial proportions of professors in each group).

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

The probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly from the pool is:
\[ P(\mathrm{Computer\ Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly from the pool is:
\[ P(\mathrm{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

When considering the description, which does not give specific traits that distinctly differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume that the description could apply equally to professors in both groups. 

Therefore, the likelihood of Jason being from the computer science group given the provided description is:
\[ P(\mathrm{Computer\ Science\ |\ Description}) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
