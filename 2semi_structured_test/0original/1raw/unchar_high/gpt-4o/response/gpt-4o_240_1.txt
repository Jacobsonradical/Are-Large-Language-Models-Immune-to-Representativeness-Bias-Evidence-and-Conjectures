Sure, let's break down the problem:

1. There are 100 professors total: 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities.
2. We have only the provided description to go on.
3. We need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of computer science professors and humanities professors in this sample.

The base rate for a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
The base rate for a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Given no additional specific information in the description that strongly differentiates between the two fields, the best estimate is to rely on these base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
