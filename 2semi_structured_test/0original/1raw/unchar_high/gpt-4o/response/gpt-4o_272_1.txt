To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We are given the following:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Assuming that Jason was randomly chosen from the pool of 100 professors, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum))\) is:

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that we do not have any additional specific information linking Jason's traits to a particular field beyond what has already been given, we can consider his description as equally likely to apply to any professor in the sample. Thus, the likelihood of Jason being chosen, given that he is a computer science professor, is the same as being chosen, given that he is a humanities professor.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor once he has been chosen at random remains proportional to the initial distribution of the computer science professors in the sample.

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
