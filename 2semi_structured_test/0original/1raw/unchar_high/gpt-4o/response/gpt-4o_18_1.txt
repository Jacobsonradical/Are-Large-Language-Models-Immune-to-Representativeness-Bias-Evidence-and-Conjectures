To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the sample sizes and the fact that the description provided doesn't specifically favor one discipline over the other. 

Given the sample sizes:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Here is the calculation for the probability:

Total number of professors = 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
P(computer science) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
P(computer science) = 75 / 100
P(computer science) = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
