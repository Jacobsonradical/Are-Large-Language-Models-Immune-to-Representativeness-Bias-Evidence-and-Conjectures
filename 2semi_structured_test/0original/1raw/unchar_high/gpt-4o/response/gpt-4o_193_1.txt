To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- Total professors in sample = 100 (75 in computer science + 25 in humanities)
- The prior probability of a professor being from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
- The prior probability of a professor being from humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid B) \) is the probability of A given B.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of B.

For this specific problem:
- \( A \) is the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches.

Since the description given does not contain any specific distinguishing factor between computer science and humanities professors, we assume \( P(B \mid A) = P(B \mid \neg A) \). Thus,

\[ P(A \mid B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
