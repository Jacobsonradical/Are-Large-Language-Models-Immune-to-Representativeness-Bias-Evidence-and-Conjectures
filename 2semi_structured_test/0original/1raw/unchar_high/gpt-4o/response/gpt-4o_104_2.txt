To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total: 100 professors

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description provided does not give specific information that would alter the likelihood based on the traits mentioned, we will use the proportion directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
