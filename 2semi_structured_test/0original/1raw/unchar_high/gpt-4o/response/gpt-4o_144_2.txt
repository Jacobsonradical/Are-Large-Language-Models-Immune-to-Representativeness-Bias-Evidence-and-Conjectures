To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

- Total number of professors: 100 (75 computer science, 25 humanities).
- Prior probability of a professor being from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability of a professor being from humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we do not have any specific discriminative information that would indicate whether Jason is more likely to be in computer science or humanities, we assume that the description "high ability and strong motivation" applies similarly to professors in both fields. Therefore, the likelihood portion of Bayes' theorem remains neutral.

Given:
\( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum) \).

Bayes' theorem in this context (given Description is equally applied) simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Given that \( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum) \), the probability \( P(Description) \) can be expressed through the law of total probability:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P
