{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Without additional information indicating a bias towards one field, the probability that Jason is from the computer science group is proportional to the number of computer science professors in the sample.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, assuming random selection, is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
