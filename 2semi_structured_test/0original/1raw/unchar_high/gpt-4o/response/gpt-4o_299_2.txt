Given that we have a sample of 100 professors, 75 of whom are in computer science and 25 in the humanities, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75%. This equates to a probability of 0.75.

The description provided for Jason does not contain specific information to distinguish whether he is more likely to be from computer science or the humanities. Considering only the base rates from the sample, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains reflective of these base rates.

Therefore, based on the information provided:

{"probability": "0.75"}
