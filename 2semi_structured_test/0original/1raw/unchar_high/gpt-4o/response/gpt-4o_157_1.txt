To determine the probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and that Jason is chosen at random from the total sample.

1. **Base rates**:
   - Number of computer science professors (CS) = 75
   - Number of humanities professors (H) = 25
   - Total number of professors = 100

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Given the description of Jason, we don't have specific evidence that differentiates CS professors from humanities professors. Therefore, we should update our beliefs based solely on the base rates.

Using the base rates directly in this situation, we calculate:

\[P(CS | \text{description})\]

Because the description does not give us additional distinguishing information, it is reasonable to assume that the probability remains proportional to the base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{Total number of professors} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

So our updated probability is:
