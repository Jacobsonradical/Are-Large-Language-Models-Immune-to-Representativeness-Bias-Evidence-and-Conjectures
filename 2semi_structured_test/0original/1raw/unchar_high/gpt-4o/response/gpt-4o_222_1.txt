To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we start with the fact that the study sampled 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This forms our prior probabilities:

- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider if the description provides any differential likelihood between the two groups. However, since there is no specific information in Jason's description that strongly suggests a higher likelihood of being from one group over the other, we assume that the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups (conditional independence).

Therefore, our posterior probability P(Jason | CS) would remain proportional to our prior probability P(CS).

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is directly related to the prior probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
