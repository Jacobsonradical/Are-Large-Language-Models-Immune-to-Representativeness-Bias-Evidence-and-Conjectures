To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior probabilities**: 
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood**: Assuming that the description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) is equally likely among both computer science and humanities professors, the likelihood is the same for both groups.

Since the description does not differentiate between the two groups, the probabilities are directly proportional to the sizes of the groups.

Therefore, the probability Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
   
\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
