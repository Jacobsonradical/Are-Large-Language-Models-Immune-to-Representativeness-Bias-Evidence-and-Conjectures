Certainly! To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider a few things:

1. The prior probability based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
2. The likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Firstly, letâ€™s calculate the prior probability:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we lack specific information distinguishing Jason's description as being more likely to describe computer science professors over humanities professors or vice versa, we can assume that the likelihood of his description fitting a professor is the same across both disciplines.

Given this, the probability we are trying to find, \( P(CS|D) \), is:
\[ P(CS|D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) / P(D) \]

Where,
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given a computer science professor, which we are assuming to be equal to \( P(D|Hum) \),
- \( P(D) \) is the overall
