Given the information provided, we account for both the base rates (prior probabilities) of the professors in the sample and the description provided for Jason.

First, we note that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This gives us prior probabilities based solely on numbers:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description of Jason includes attributes such as high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, and professional environment. These qualities do not strongly favor either computer science or humanities professors based on the description provided. Given that there is no additional information to distinguish between the two groups based on the description, we rely mainly on the base rates.

Thus, our estimate should closely align with the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
