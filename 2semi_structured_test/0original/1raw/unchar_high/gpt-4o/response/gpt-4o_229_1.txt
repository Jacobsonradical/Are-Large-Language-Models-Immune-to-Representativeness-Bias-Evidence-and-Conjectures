To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates and any information given that might distinguish between the computer science and humanities professors.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Based on Jason's description, there are no specific traits or details provided that are directly associated with either discipline. Therefore, we rely only on the proportions of professors in each group.

The total number of professors is 100.

The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
