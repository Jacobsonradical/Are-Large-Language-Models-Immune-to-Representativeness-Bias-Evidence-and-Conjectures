Given the problem setup, we need to consider the base rates of the samples provided:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100. Therefore, the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description given for Jason does not contain any information strongly indicative of belonging to either the computer science or humanities group. It mentions general positive attributes like high ability, strong motivation, and good reputation, which can apply equally to professors in both fields.

So, in the absence of any other distinguishing information, we use the prior probabilities directly to infer the likelihood.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
