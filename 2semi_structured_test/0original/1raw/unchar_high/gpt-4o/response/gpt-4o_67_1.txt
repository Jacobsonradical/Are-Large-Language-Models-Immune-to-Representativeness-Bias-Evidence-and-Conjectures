Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, without any additional information suggesting a greater likelihood for one group over the other based on the description, we base the probability on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
