The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 75 out of 100, or 0.75, since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without additional information that would differentiate between computer science and humanities professors based on the description, the most reasonable probability to assign based on the base rate alone is 0.75.
