To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
