To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates provided in the study. The base rates are:

- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in the humanities

In total, there are 100 professors. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the computer science group is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities group is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, there aren't specific details that point definitively to one group over the other. Therefore, we will rely purely on the base rates to estimate the probability.

Using these base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's Description}) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75. 

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
