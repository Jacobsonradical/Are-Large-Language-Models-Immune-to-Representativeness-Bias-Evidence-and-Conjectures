To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process:

1. Total number of professors in the sample: \(75 + 25 = 100\)
2. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
3. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
4. Since the description of Jason is given without any direct indications of his field, we assume that the description could equally apply to any professor in either field. Thus, we treat the description as non-informative, and the prior probabilities are not altered.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Jason}) = P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.75
\]

Hence, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
