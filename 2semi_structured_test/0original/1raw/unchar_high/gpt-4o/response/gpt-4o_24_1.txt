To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportions of the two groups in the sample and the fact that the description of Jason does not preferentially describe someone in computer science or the humanities based on the provided information. 

We have:
- 75 computer science professors,
- 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor (Jason) is from the computer science group is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the entire sample.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
