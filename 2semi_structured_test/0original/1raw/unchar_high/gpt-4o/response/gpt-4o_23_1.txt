To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use the principle of conditional probability. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step calculation:

1. **Total Professors**: There are 100 professors in total (75 computer science + 25 humanities).

2. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) \) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities: \( P(Hum) \) = 25/100 = 0.25

3. **Given Description**: We know that Jason is highly able, strongly motivated, and well-liked. However, the description does not provide specific traits that strongly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, so we assume the description applies equally across both groups.

4. **Likelihood**: If the description applies equally to professors in both fields, the likelihood of having such a description is equal for both groups.

Therefore, we leverage the base rates directly:
- **Probability Jason is a computer science professor**: \( P(CS | Description) = P(CS) \)
  
Since there's no additional distinguishing information provided by the description to alter the base rates, the probability remains the same as the prior probability:

**Result**:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
