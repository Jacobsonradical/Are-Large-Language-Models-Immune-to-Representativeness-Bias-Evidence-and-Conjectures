To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability for a hypothesis as evidence or new information becomes available.

We have:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total professors: 100

Assuming that the description "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation" is equally likely for a professor in either field, we can use the ratio of professors in each field to find the probability.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not give us any new information that would make one field more probable than the other beyond the prior distribution, we can use these priors directly.

Therefore the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

So,

{"probability": "0.75"}
