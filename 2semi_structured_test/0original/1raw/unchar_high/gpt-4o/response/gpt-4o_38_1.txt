To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the sample, we have:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we have no additional information that specifically differentiates the computer science professors from the humanities professors beyond the random selection, we can directly use these proportions to estimate the probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
