To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, one can apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Base Rates**:
   - Number of computer science professors: 75
   - Number of humanities professors: 25
   - Total number of professors: 100

2. **Prior Probability**:
   The prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   The prior probability \(P(\text{Humanities})\) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood**:
   The given description of Jason seems equally likely to describe a successful professor in either discipline, assuming no additional distinguishing information. Therefore, we can assume that the description is equally likely to be observed among computer science and humanities professors.

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability. Since the description is equally likely to be observed in either group, the likelihood \(
