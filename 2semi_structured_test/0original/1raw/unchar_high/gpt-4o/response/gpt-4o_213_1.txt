To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rate of computer science professors in the sample and compare it to the base rate of humanities professors, since no specific characteristics about Jason definitively point to one field over the other. 

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors among the 100 professors. 

The base rate probability for a professor being in computer science is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate probability for a professor being in the humanities is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that the description doesn't favor one field over the other, we should use these base rates directly. Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
