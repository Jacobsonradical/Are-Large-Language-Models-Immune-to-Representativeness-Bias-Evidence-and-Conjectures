To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the numbers of professors in each group and apply Bayes' theorem. 

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, there are 100 professors in total.

Given no additional information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors based on the description provided, we assume there is an equal likelihood for any professor in the sample to match Jason's description, conditional only on their respective populations.

Thus, the probability \( P(\text{computer science} | \text{description}) \) can be calculated as:

\[
P(\text{computer science} | \text{description}) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\{"probability": "0.75"\}
\]
