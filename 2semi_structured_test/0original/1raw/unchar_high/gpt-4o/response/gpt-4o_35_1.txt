Given that the study sampled 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75

Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:
P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

The description provided does not contain specific details that would distinctly classify Jason into either group based on the traits mentioned. Therefore, we'll rely solely on the base rates (prior probabilities) provided by the study's sample sizes to determine our probability.

Given no compelling evidence to favor one group over the other based on the description provided, one reasonable way to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is to use the prior probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
