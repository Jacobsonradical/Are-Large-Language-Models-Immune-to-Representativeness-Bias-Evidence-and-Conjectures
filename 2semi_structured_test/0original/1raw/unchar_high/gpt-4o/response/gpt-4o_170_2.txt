To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors given in the study.

The study sample consists of:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.

Hence, the total sample size is 100 professors.

We assume that the description of Jason is chosen randomly from the 100 available descriptions.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Plugging in the given numbers:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
