Given that Jason is one of the 100 professors studied, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups. We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Based on these numbers, the prior probability that any random professor from the sample is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that any random professor from the sample is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided does not include any specific details that would more strongly indicate one field over the other. Because no additional specific information about Jason aligns him more with either group, we use the base rate probabilities:

\[ P(CS|description) \approx P(CS) \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{\{"probability": "0.75"\}}
