To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we are given no specific information about personality traits that differentiate the two types of professors, we will assume the description doesn't favor one group over the other. We will rely on the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study.

There are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100. The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the information provided and using the proportionality of the groups:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
