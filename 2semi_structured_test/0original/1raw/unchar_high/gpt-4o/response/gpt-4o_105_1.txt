Given the description and understanding that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we start by acknowledging that before considering any other traits, the base rate for a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is 75/100, or 0.75.

Since the description provided does not seem to heavily lean towards any specific departmental traits typical for computer science or humanities and predominantly focuses on general personality traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, which can be equally distributed among both fields, we should rely on the base rate probability.

With that in mind, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
