To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need the likelihood, which is the probability of the given description \( D \) if Jason is a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \), and the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \). Since we do not have specific information that distinguishes these attributes between the two groups, we assume that the descriptions could be equally likely across both groups.

With this assumption:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \)

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), they cancel out in
