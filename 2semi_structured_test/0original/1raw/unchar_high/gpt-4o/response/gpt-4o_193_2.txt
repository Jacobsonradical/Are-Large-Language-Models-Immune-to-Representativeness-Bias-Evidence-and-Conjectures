First, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups within the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. 

The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, given no other information, is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provides some evidence that might help us update these probabilities. However, the description is fairly general and likely to apply to successful professors in both fields. Without specific evidence that significantly differentiates between the two groups, our best estimate remains based on the base rates.

Thus, considering no significant differentiating information in the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors should be aligned with the base rate:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) \approx P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
