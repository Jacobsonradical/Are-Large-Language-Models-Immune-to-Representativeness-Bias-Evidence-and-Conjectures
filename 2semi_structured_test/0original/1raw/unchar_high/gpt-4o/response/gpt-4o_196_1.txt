To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, we need the prior probabilities and the conditional probability.

- The prior probability of picking a computer science professor (CS) is the number of CS professors divided by the total number of professors:
  \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor (H) is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors:
  \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Assuming that a high ability, strong motivation, and good professional reputation are traits that do not vary significantly between these two groups of professors, we can treat the description as equally likely for both groups.

The descriptions were written based on the personality traits observed without introducing substantial bias towards a specific field. So, we can assume:
- The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(description | CS) \):
  Since the description is equally likely for both groups: \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \)

- \( P(description | CS) \approx P(description | H) \approx 1 \)

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cd
