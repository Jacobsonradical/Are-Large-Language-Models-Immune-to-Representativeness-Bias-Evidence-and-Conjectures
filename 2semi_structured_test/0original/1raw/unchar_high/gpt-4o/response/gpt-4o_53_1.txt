To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use the relevant statistical data provided:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities).

Since one description was chosen at random, without additional information, we can assume that each professor had an equal chance of being selected. Therefore, the probability \( P \) that Jason is from computer science is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
