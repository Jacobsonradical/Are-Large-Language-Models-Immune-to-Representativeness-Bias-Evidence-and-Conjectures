To determine the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I need to consider the proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Given that the description lists common attributes but does not provide specific information that would distinguish between a computer science professor or a humanities professor, I will use the base rate (proportion) of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \) is given by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is as follows:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
