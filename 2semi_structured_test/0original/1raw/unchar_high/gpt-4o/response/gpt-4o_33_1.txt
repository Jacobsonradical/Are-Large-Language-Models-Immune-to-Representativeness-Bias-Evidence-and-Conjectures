To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we start by using the information provided:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

If we assume that the description of Jason is equally likely to apply to any of the professors, the initial probability is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. This is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}
\]
