To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample compared to the total number of professors.

The study comprises:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

So the total number of professors is:
75 + 25 = 100

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, based on the available information and considering there's no additional distinguishing characteristic provided in Jason's description that would sway the probability towards one group or the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
