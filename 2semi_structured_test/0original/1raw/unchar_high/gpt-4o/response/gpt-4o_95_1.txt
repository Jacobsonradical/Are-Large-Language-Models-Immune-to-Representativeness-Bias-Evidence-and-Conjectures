Given the information provided and the format requested, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. However, with the given data, a direct analytical solution via Bayes' theorem may not be strictly necessary or possible without specific likelihood values from personality traits.

Instead, we can use the base rate (the proportion of computer science professors versus humanities professors in the sample) to estimate this probability.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The base rate probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, without any additional distinguishing information from the personality description that strongly leans towards one field over the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based simply on the base rate.
