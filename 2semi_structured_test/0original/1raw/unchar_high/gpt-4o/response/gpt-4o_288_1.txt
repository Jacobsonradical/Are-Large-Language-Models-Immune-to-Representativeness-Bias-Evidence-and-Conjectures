To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how:

1. **Base Rates**: 
   - The number of computer science professors is 75.
   - The number of humanities professors is 25.
   - Total number of professors is 100.

2. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability (P(CS)) of choosing a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
   - The prior probability (P(Humanities)) of choosing a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

3. **Likelihood**:
   - We assume that the description provided is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. This assumption indicates that any specific personality description is equally probable, given either group, meaning P(Description|CS) â‰ˆ P(Description|Humanities).

Since the description does not give any specific information to alter the prior probabilities beyond the base rates:
   
**By Bayes' theorem**:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Here, P(Description) normalizes the probability, but since P(Description|CS) and P(Description|Humanities) are assumed equal and P(CS) and P(Humanities) represent prior probabilities solely based on the base rates:

\[ P(C
