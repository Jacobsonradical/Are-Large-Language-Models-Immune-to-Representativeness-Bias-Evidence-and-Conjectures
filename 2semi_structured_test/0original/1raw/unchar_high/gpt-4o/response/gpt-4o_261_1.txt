To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we start with the given numbers: there are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors. This makes a total of 100 professors.

Given that Jason could equally likely be any one of these 100 professors, we use the principle of equal likelihood.

The proportion of CS professors in the sample is:
\[
\frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
