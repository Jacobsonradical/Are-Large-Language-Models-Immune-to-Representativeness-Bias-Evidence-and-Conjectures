To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The relevant numbers here are:

- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in humanities
- 100 professors in total

Given that we have no specific information that would sway us one way or the other based strictly on the description, we assume that each professor has an equal chance of being chosen. Therefore, the probability can be calculated as the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Probability = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
Probability = 75 / 100
Probability = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
