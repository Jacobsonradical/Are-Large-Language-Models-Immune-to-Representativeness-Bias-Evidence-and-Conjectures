To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) = Total probability of the description

First, we have the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the description is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors, therefore:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

The total probability \( P(D) \) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25
