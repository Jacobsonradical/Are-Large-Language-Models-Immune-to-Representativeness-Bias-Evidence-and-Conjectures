Based on the provided information, we know the makeup of the sample: 75 professors are from computer science, and 25 are from the humanities. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the group is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that would suggest he is more likely to be in one group over the other, so we rely solely on the initial probabilities based on the sample distribution.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
