To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we define:

- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event corresponding to the description given for Jason.

First, we determine the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor:

\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the probability of the description matching each group. Without specific information regarding how descriptive traits are distributed between these two groups, we might reasonably assume that the description is equally likely for either group. Thus,

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A') = 1 \]

Then, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A')} \]

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0
