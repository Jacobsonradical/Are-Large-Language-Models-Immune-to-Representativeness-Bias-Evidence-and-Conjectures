To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we should consider the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the study, given no other information.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, totaling 100 professors. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is therefore:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, given no additional information about Jason's specific traits relative to the disciplines, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
