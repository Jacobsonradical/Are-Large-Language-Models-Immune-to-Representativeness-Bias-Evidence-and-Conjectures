To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, let's consider the number of professors in each category and the given description. 

We have:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total professors = 75 + 25 = 100

Given that the description of Jason is randomly chosen from among all 100 professors, we can apply simple probability.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Using the numbers:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}}= \frac{75}{100}= 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
