To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason has the given description.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let's assume that the description does not specifically favor either group (both groups have similar descriptions), so:

- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \), where \( A' \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We can assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \approx 1 \) as the given description could apply to professors from both fields.

Thus,

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) +
