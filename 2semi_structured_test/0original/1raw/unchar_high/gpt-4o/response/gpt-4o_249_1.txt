To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors among the 100 samples, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how we can approach this problem:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Conditional Probabilities (Likelihood):**
   - The description of Jason doesn't provide specific distinguishing features that are exclusive to either group. It generally describes traits that could be found in both groups (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues).

   Given this lack of specific differentiating information, we proceed under the assumption that each group (computer science and humanities professors) is equally likely to contain people with these traits. This implies that the likelihood the described characteristics apply is the same for both groups.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Since the description doesn’t contain specific information that would make it more likely for Jason to belong to one group over the other, we rely mainly on the base rates.
   - The probability that the provided description pertains to a computer science professor is proportional to the prior probabilities.

Given these considerations, the probability \( P(\text{CS} | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor (CS) given the
