To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's start by defining our known quantities:

- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Assuming the description provided is equally likely for both computer science professors and humanities professors, we have:

\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Human
