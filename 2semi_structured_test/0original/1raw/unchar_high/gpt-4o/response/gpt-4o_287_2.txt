To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors within the total sample and make an assumption that the description is equally likely to fit a professor from either group.

Let's break it down:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Hence, there are 100 professors in total.

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (assuming no additional distinguishing information other than group proportions) is:
