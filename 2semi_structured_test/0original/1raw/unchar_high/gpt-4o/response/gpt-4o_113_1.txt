To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this scenario:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- A random description is chosen, so the probability of selecting any specific professor's description is proportional to the number of such professors in the sample.

The base rate probability (prior probability) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

The base rate probability (prior probability) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given that the description of Jason does not provide any distinguishing feature directly linked to whether he is a computer science or humanities professor, we have no reason to update our prior probability. Therefore, we use the base rates directly.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
