Given the sample sizes of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we should use the principle of base rates to determine the probability. There are no specific indicators in Jason's description that strongly imply he belongs to one group over the other beyond the general traits, which are likely to be common among both groups of successful professors.

Using the base rate information:

- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be estimated by the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

P(Computer Science) = Number of Computer Science Professors / Total Number of Professors
                    = 75 / 100
                    = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75, which can be formatted as:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
