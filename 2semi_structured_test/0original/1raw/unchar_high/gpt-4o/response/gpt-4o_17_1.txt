To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's first consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample. 

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total sample size is 100 professors.

The probability of selecting a computer science professor at random from this sample is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability of selecting a humanities professor at random from this sample is:

\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description of Jason does not provide specific traits that clearly distinguish between the two groups of professors based on their field. Therefore, we will use the base rates as the primary factor in our calculation.

Given the base rates, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be given as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability should be formatted as:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
