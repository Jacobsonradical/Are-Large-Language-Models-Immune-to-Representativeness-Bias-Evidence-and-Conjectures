Given the data provided, the total sample consists of 100 professors, with 75 from computer science (CS) and 25 from the humanities. Since Jason was chosen at random, we start with a prior probability based on the composition of the sample.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is determined by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:
\[ \text{Prior Probability (CS)} = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

There are no specific details in the description that clearly differentiate between traits of computer science professors and humanities professors. Given this, the description doesn't provide additional information to change our initial probability. We rely solely on the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
