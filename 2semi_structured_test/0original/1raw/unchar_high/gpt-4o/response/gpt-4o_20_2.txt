Given the study sample size, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the total number of professors 100. To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description, we can use Bayes' theorem, but in this scenario, we don't have specific evidence favoring one group over the other based on the description. Therefore, we consider the base rates:

The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
