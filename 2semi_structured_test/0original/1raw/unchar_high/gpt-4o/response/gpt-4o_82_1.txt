To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We are given the following information:

1. There are 75 successful professors in computer science and 25 in the humanities.
2. A description was chosen at random.

Bayes' Theorem enables us to update the probability of a hypothesis, given new evidence. Here, our hypotheses are:
- \(H_{CS}\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_{H}\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are interested in \( P(H_{CS} \mid E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (the description of Jason).

Using the given probabilities:
\[
P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

The description of Jason doesn't provide any specific evidence to differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, so we will assume \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E \mid H_{H}) \) are equal and thus cancel out.

The formula for \( P(H_{CS} \mid E) \) is:
\[
P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P
