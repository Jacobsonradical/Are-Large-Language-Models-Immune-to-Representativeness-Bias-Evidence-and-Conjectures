To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the relative proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the study sample.

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total sample size is 100 professors.

Using these numbers, the prior probability (before considering Jason's description) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have any additional specific information that differentiates Jason's personality traits as being more indicative of computer science or humanities, we will base our probability purely on the prior distribution.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
