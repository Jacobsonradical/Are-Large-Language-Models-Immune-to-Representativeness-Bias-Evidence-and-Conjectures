First, we can consider the base rates, which tell us the initial probabilities before considering additional information. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving us a base rate of 75% for computer science and 25% for humanities.

Given the description, there is no specific information that strongly distinguishes Jason as more likely to be a professor in one field over the other. Both groups are likely to contain individuals with high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputations.

Thus, we should rely predominantly on the base rates to estimate the probability:

Base rate for computer science professors: 75/100 = 0.75
Base rate for humanities professors: 25/100 = 0.25

Given no additional distinguishing characteristics in Jason's description, the posterior probability remains close to the base rate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is around 0.75.
