To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the given numbers in the population. We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

We are selecting one description at random out of 100 available descriptions. We want to calculate the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Given:
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
