Based on the given description of Jason, it's important to recognize that there isn't specific information relating to distinct traits of professors in computer science versus the humanities within the provided context. Consequently, our assessment should primarily depend on the distribution of the provided sample:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Since Jason's field of expertise isn't explicitly indicated in the description and given the unequal numbers, the probability can be calculated using the principle of proportional representation:

Probability = (Number of computer science professors) / (Total number of professors)

Thus:

Probability = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Hence, our calculation based on the sample distribution leads to the following probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
