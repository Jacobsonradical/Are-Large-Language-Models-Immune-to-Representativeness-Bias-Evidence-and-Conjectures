{"probability": "0.75"}

To arrive at this number, I consider that out of the 100 professors, 75 are from computer science and 25 are from the humanities. Therefore, the initial probability, without any additional information, that Jason is from computer science would be \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\). The given description doesn’t provide specific details that suggest a higher or lower likelihood for either discipline beyond what’s already provided by the proportions in the sample. Consequently, the calculated probability remains \(\frac{75}{100}\).
