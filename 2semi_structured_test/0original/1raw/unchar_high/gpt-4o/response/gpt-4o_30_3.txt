To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the breakdown of the problem:

- Number of computer science professors (C): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

First, we find the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a professor is from computer science (\(P(C)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability that a professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Given that we have no additional information to differentiate the likelihood of this description fitting either a computer science or humanities professor, we assume the description is equally likely to describe individuals in both fields. Therefore, the likelihood is the same for both groups.

Thus, using the prior probabilities, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C) \cdot P(D|C)}{P(C) \cdot P(D|C) + P(H) \cdot P(D|H)}
\]

Since \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0
