Given that the information about Jason does not specify any field-specific traits, and considering the numbers of professors from each field in the sample, the probability can be estimated through the base rates provided (i.e., there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors).

Thus, the probability \( P(CS \mid Jason) \) that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description of Jason, can be calculated using the base rates:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
