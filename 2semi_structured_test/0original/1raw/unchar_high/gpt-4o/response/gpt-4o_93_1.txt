Given the information provided in the description and the relative sample sizes, we want to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Out of the 100 professors, 75 are in computer science and 25 are in the humanities. Without additional distinguishing information, we assume that the personality profile provided is equally likely to describe any professor in the sample.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
