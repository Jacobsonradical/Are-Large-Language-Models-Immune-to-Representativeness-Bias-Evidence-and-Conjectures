To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Total Sample Size**: 75 (Computer Science) + 25 (Humanities) = 100 professors.
2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of a professor being in Computer Science (P(CS)) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
   - Probability of a professor being in Humanities (P(H)) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Without any specific distinguishing information between the groups beyond the general description, we assume that the provided description applies equally to both groups. This simplifies the calculation and we rely on the prior probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the prior probability of being in computer science:
   
{"probability": "0.75"}
