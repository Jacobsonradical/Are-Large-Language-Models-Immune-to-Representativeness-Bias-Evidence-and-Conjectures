To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the approach:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): The description matches Jason.

2. **Calculate the overall probabilities:**
   - Probability of choosing a computer science professor initially (\( P(A) \)): 
     \[
     P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability of choosing a humanities professor initially (\( P(A^c) \)): 
     \[
     P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

3. **Assume equal likelihood of the description regardless of field:**
   Since we don’t have any additional information indicating that Jason's description ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation") is more likely to belong to either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we can assume the description does not make one group more likely than the other. 

   Therefore, 
   \[
   P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = 1
   \]
   
4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' Theorem gives:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B
