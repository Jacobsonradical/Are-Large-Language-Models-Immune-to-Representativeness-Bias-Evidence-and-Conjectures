To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can employ Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as new evidence or information becomes available.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
- Total number of professors interviewed is 100.
- The base rate probability between the two groups is: P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75, and P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25.

We must update these base rates with the given description of Jason. However, the description does not provide any specific information that clearly distinguishes Jason as belonging to one group over the other (e.g., specific traits or domain-specific clues). Without additional specific information, we assume no differentiating power of the description.

Thus, we rely on the base rate probability:

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
