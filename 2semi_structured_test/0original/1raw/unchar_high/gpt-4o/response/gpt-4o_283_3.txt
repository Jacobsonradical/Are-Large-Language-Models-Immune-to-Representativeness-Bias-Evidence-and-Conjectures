To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayesâ€™ theorem. Given the study sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25

The description of Jason gives us no specific information that distinguishes between the two groups, beyond the overall statistics about the sample. Therefore, we assume there's no additional information favoring either group beyond their original proportions.

Thus, the probability \( P(CS | \text{description}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, should be proportional to the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
