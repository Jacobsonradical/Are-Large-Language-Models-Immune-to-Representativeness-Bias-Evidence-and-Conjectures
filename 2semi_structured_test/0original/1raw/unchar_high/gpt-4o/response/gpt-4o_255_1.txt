To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to account for the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

From this, we can calculate the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science or the humanities:

- Probability that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that any randomly chosen professor is in humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we have no additional distinguishing information about Jason that is specific to either field, we use these base rates to determine the requested probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
