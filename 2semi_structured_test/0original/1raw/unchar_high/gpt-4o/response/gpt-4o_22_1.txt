To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use the principle of base rates from probability theory. 

First, we note that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is:
75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100 professors.

The base rate (prior probability) of a professor being in computer science, \( P(CS) \), is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate (prior probability) of a professor being in the humanities, \( P(Humanities) \), is:
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming we have no additional information that to differentiate between the groups further than the given description, we use these base rates directly.

Since there is no indication that the description favors one discipline over the other, we rely solely on these base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{Jason is CS}) = 0.75 \]

Here's the answer in the requested format:
