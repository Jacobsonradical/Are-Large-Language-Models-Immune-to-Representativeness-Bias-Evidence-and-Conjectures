{"probability": "0.75"} 

This is based on the Bayesian principle of prior probability. Given that 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science, there's a 75% chance ("probability": "0.75") that any randomly selected professor, including Jason, is a computer science professor. This assumes that the description provided is not significantly more or less likely to fit professors from one group over the other, thus retaining the prior probability.
