To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. However, the description does not provide enough specific detail about personality traits that would help distinguish between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we must rely on the base rates given for the number of professors in each group.

We know from the study that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The total number of professors is 75 + 25 = 100.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since there is no additional information suggesting that Jason is more likely to belong to one group rather than the other, we use these base rates as the probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]

{"probability": "0.75"}
