Given the information, the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample is 75:25. This means there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, which creates a ratio of 3:1. 

Using this base rate information, and without any additional distinguishing details in Jason's description favoring one group over the other, we can use these ratios directly to estimate the probability. 

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we calculate it as the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
