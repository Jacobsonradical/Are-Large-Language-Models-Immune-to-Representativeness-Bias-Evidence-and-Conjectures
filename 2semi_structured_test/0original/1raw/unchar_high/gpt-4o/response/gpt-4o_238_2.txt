To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem can help us update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, whether Jason is a computer science professor) based on given evidence.

Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability**: This is the probability before considering any additional information. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The probability of randomly picking a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of randomly picking a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. Since the description of Jason does not favor either group in a distinctive manner, we will assume that the likelihood of finding a similar description among computer science professors is the same as among humanities professors. Therefore:
   - \( P(E|CS) \) is roughly the same as \( P(E|H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability**: This is the probability of the hypothesis after taking the evidence into account.

Given the lack of distinguishing information in the provided description, we will rely on the prior probabilities:

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac
