Based on the given data, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Given no further distinguishing information specific to Jason's field, a reasonable approach is to assume that the probability of Jason being in either group is proportional to the number of professors in each group.

The total number of professors is:
75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
