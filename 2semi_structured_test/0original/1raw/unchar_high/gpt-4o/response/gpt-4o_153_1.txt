To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample, which will be used as prior probabilities in a Bayesian framework.

We have:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

Without any additional information that could distinctly differentiate computer science professors and humanities professors based on Jason's description, we rely on the proportions of each group in the sample.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given no other distinguishing information in the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated as:
\[ P(\text{Jason is CS}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
