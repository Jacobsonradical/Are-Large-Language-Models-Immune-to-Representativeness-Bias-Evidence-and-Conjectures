To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample compared to the total number of professors.

The sample consists of:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Total number of professors = 75 + 25 = 100

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Probability (computer science) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors
                               = 75 / 100
                               = 0.75

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
