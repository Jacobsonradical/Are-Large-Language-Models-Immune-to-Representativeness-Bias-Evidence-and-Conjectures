Based on the provided details, we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors. Since we are given Jason's description but no specific information that distinguishes between the traits of computer science professors and humanities professors, we will assume that Jason is equally likely to be from any of the two groups based on the proportion of each group in the sample.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is determined by the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
