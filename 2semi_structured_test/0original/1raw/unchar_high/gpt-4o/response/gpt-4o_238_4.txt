To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The initial likelihoods (prior probabilities) that Jason is from either group are based on the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the study. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given that the description of Jason does not provide any specific traits that clearly distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume that the descriptions were equally likely to describe individuals from either group. Therefore, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D | \text{CS}) \), is equal to the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D | \text{Humanities}) \).

Thus, we use the prior probabilities to estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor:

\[
P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

Because the description is assumed equally likely for both groups:

\[
