To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Firstly, we know there are 100 professors in total:

- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Let's denote the hypotheses as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given the description of Jason, which doesn't directly differentiate between computer science or humanities professors. However, we can consider the initial (prior) probabilities:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Because the description of Jason is chosen at random and the description does not present any information that differentiates the probabilities given `C` or `H` (they are equally likely given the description we have), the likelihoods cancel out in this context. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the prior probability:

{\ "probability": "0.75" }
