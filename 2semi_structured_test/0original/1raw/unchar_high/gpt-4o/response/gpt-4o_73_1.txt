Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample of 100 professors, without any additional information, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor can be calculated by considering the base proportion of each group.

The probability P(CS) of choosing a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability P(H) of choosing a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description provided does not contain any information differentiating between the two groups in terms of specific personality traits or characteristics unique to either computer science or humanities. Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains based solely on the base rate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
