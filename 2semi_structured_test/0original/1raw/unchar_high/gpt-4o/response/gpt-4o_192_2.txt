To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of the two groups in the sample. 

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. So the probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science is:

P(CS) = number of CS professors / total number of professors
       = 75 / 100
       = 0.75

Since no additional information provided in Jason's description explicitly favors one group over the other, we rely on these base probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
