Given the information provided, we should consider both the base rates of the groups (computer science professors and humanities professors) as well as the description of Jason to estimate the probability.

Here's the base rate information:
- 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are from humanities.

This means that the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 0.75, and the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is 0.25.

Considering the description, there are no specific traits or information that strongly distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors. The description provided is fairly general and could apply equally to a professor from either field.

Given this information, I will use just the base rates to estimate the probability.

\( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
