To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Given the description doesn't focus on subject-specific traits, we'll mainly use the base rates of the groups to calculate this probability.

- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Bayes' theorem in this scenario simplifies to the proportion of computer science professors:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description is:

{\ "probability": "0.75" }
