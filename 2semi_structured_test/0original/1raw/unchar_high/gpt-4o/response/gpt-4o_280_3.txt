To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context helps us update our probability estimates based on the given new information (the description of Jason).

Let's define the following:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to determine \( P(A | B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description of him.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
- \( P(A^c) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25

Next, we need \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | A^c) \). These probabilities represent the likelihood of the description matching computer science professors and humanities professors, respectively.

Without having specific data on the exact likelihoods (which typically would be derived from the detailed analysis from the personality tests), a simplifying assumption is to treat the description as equally likely across both groups since no specific traits favoring one group over the other are mentioned.

Using this simplifying assumption:
- \( P(B | A) = P(B | A^c) \)
