Given that the base rates are 75 for computer science professors and 25 for humanities professors, without additional distinguishing information in the description, the simplest approach is to use the base rate probabilities. Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Probability (Computer Science Professor)} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Here is the answer in the specified format:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
