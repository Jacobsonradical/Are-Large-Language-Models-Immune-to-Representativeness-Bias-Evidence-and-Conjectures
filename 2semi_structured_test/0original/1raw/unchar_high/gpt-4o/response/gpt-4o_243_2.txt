To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 75 + 25 = 100.

Now, we need to calculate the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. This is straightforward:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Given the description of Jason, we need to assume that the probability of such a description is fairly distributed across both groups unless we have evidence suggesting otherwise. Since we lack specific data to indicate that computer science or humanities professors are more likely to fit Jason's description, we assume similar likelihood.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

However, if we assume that the description does not provide more propensity towards one group over another (i.e., P(Description|CS) = P(Description|H)), the simplifying factor removes the specific impact of "Description".

So, based only on prior probabilities, the probability that Jason is one of the
