Given the information provided, we have a sample of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

The probability \( P \) of choosing a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) randomly from the sample is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability \( P \) of choosing a humanities professor \( P(H) \) randomly from the sample is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without any additional information that distinguishes between the characteristics of computer science and humanities professors, the prior probabilities remain our best estimate for any individual being either a computer science or humanities professor.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).
