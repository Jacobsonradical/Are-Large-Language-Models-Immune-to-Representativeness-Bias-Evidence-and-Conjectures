{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's a brief explanation of the rationale behind this probability:
The base rates provided are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Without any specific information favoring one field over the other, the likelihood that Jason belongs to the larger group (computer science) is simply the proportion of that group in the overall sample. Therefore, the probability is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.
