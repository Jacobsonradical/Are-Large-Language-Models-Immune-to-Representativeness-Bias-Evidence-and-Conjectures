To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem involves updating our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

However, in this case, we will use the principle of equally likely outcomes given random selection. 

We know there are:

- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total = 100 professors

We are given a random description of one professor, and we need to determine the probability that this professor is from computer science.

Since the description does not contain any specific information that distinguishes between the two groups of professors, we assume the probability of randomly selecting any given professor is proportional to the number of professors in each group.

Therefore, the probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
