To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are given no information favoring either group based on the description, we assume \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equally likely. Thus, \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \).

Then using these probabilities:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]

Because \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), let \( k = P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):
\[ P(D) = k * P(CS) +
