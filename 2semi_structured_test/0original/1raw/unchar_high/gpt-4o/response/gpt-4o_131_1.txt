To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we note the proportion of computer science professors (CS) to humanities professors (H).

- There are 75 CS professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 H professors out of 100 total professors.

This translates to a ratio of 75:25, or equivalently, 3:1.

Given no additional specific information that discrimiates between CS and H professors in Jason's description, we can assume the prior probabilities:  
P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

As there is nothing in Jasonâ€™s description that decidedly differentiates between CS and H professors, we assume the likelihood of this description being applied to either group is the same.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the proportion of CS professors in the overall sample.

So, the probability is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
