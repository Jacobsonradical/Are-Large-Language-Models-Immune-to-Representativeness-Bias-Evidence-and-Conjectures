To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to utilize the concept of prior probabilities from Bayesian reasoning.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We are given a description but no specific characteristics that clearly differentiate between the two groups. Therefore, based on the prior probabilities alone, we can calculate the probability that Jason is from computer science using Bayes' theorem:

Given no distinguishing information in the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is primarily governed by these prior probabilities.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{Probability} = 0.75 \]

Thus the answer is:
