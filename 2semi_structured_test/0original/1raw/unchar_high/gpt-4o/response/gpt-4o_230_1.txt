To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We assume that the likelihood of the description given does not favor one discipline over the other, i.e., the probability of getting such a description is equally likely regardless of the discipline. Therefore, the likelihood of the observed description given computer science or humanities is the same.

Given this, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) is the normalizing constant and given equal likelihoods:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \propto P(\text{CS})
\]

Given our \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \):

\[
P(\text{CS} |
