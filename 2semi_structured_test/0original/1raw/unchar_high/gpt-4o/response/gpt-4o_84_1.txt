To determine the probability that Jason is a professor in computer science, I will use the given sample sizes and the information provided.

The given sample sizes are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

Let's assume that the description of Jason doesn't give us any specific information that would distinguish between computer science and humanities professors. In this case, the probability that Jason is from the computer science department is proportional to the number of computer science professors in the study.

Thus, the probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as:

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ P(A) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Here's the answer in the specified format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
