To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample and recognize that the description provided doesn't contain any specific details that strongly distinguish between computer science and humanities professors.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total sample size = 100 professors

The prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is:

\[ \text{Prior probability (Computer Science)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description of Jason does not provide information that significantly alters this probability, we should use the prior probability as our estimate.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
