To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of each group in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
