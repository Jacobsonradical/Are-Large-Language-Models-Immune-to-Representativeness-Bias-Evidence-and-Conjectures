To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample and assume that the description given is equally likely for both groups since the description does not provide specific information favoring one group over the other.

The sample consists of:
- 75 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- 25 tenured and successful humanities professors.

This gives us a total of 100 professors. The probability \( P(CS) \) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
