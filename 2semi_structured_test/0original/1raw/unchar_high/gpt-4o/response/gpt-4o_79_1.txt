To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to consider the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
Thus, the probability of randomly picking a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
And the probability of randomly picking a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now let's consider the likelihood of the given description. However, since we don't have detailed information about how likely the description applies to computer science professors versus humanities professors, we will assume the likelihood is similar for both fields.

Using Laplace's rule of succession (which assumes a uniform distribution due to ignorance over the likelihoods), we can assume that the description fits computer science and humanities professors equally. Therefore:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0
