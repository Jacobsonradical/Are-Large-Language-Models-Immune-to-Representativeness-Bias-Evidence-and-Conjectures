To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use the base rates provided in the problem.

- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

Using these base rates, the probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description does not provide any specific information that distinguishes whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, we rely solely on the base rates.

Using the base rate, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
