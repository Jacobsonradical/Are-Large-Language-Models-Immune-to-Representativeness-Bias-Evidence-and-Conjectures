To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need the base rates (prior probabilities) for each group:

- Probability of selecting a professor from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability of selecting a professor from humanities (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Since the description of Jason does not include specific details more likely to differentiate him between the two groups (computer science vs. humanities), we assume the likelihood of finding someone with Jason's description is equally probable in both groups. Thus,

- Probability of having Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)): 1
- Probability of having Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)): 1

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (\(P(CS|D)\)):

\(P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\)

\(P(D)\) (the total probability of the description) can be found using the law of total probability:

\(P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|
