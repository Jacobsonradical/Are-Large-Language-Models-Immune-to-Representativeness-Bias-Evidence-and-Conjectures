To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- 75 professors are from computer science.
- 25 professors are from the humanities.
- The total number of professors is 100.

P(Computer Science | Description) can be calculated as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science | Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description | Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

We assume that the description given does not favor either group (neutral evidence). Therefore, the description does not change the prior probabilities. The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description is assumed neutral:

\[ P(\text{Description | Computer Science}) = P(\text{Description | Humanities}) \]

Therefore, if we treat the description as equally likely across both groups, then the probability of picking this description from either group is proportional to the size of that group.

Thus, we compute the probability as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{75 + 25} = \
