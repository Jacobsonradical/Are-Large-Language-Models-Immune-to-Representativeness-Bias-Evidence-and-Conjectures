To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Therefore, the prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 or 0.75.

Without further details from the personality description that distinctively correlates with one field over the other, we assume that all descriptions are equally likely regardless of the field within the given set of successful professors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability is:
