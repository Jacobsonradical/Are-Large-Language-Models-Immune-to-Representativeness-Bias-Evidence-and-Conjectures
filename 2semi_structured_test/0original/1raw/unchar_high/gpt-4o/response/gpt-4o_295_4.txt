To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Total professors = 75 + 25 = 100.
   - Probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Without additional discriminative features in Jason's description that biases towards either field, we assume that a psychologist would consider Jasonâ€™s high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation equally likely in both fields.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   We need to compute \(P(\text{Description})\):
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \times P
