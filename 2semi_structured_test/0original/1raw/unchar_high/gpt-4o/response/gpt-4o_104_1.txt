To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description occurring.

Let's outline our known probabilities:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(A) \):**
   The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(A') \):**
   The proportion of humanities professors in the sample is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Since Jason is chosen randomly from the entire group, and without additional information to differentiate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \), we will assume that the traits described are equally probable among both groups. Thus, \( P(B|A)
