To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Out of 100 professors, 75 are from computer science and 25 are from the humanities. Without any further distinguishing information between the groups given the description, we use these proportions to calculate the probability.

The probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
