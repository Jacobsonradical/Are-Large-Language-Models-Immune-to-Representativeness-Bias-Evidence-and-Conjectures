To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description of Jason, we are interested in computing \( P(CS \mid D) \), where \( CS \) denotes Jason being a computer science professor and \( D \) represents the description provided.

The total sample, consisting of 100 professors (75 in computer science and 25 in humanities), leads to the following priors:

- Prior probability of a professor being in computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability of a professor being in the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description \( D \) is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors, \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are theoretically the same for practical purposes, given no specific distinguishing data is provided in \( D \). Therefore:

- \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) = 1 \)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is a normalization factor and would be:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)
