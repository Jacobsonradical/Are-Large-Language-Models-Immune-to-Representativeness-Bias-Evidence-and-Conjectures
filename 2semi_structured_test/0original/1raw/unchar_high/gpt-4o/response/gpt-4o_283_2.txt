To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which involves the following elements:

- Prior probability: The proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.
- Likelihood: The probability of selecting a person like Jason given he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.
- Evidence: The total probability of selecting a person like Jason from the entire sample.

Firstly, let's define our probabilities:
- Let \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \(D\) be the description that is provided.

The prior probabilities are:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Assuming the description applies equally to professors in both fields (since no specific information differentiates between disciplines), the likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) will be equal and thus cancel each other out in Bayes' theorem. Therefore, we simply rely on the prior probabilities to compute the desired probability.

Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)P(D|C)}{P(C)P(D|C) + P(H)P(D|H)} \]
