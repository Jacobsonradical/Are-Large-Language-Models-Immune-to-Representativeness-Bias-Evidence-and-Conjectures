To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Since we lack specific information differentiating Jason from computer science and humanities professors based solely on his description, we will initially rely on the proportion of each type of professor in the sample as the prior probability.

The sample contains:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability \((P(\text{CS}))\) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \((P(\text{Humanities}))\) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason does not provide any additional distinguishing information about whether he is more likely to be in computer science or humanities, we can base the probability on these priors alone.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.75" \]

So the final answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
