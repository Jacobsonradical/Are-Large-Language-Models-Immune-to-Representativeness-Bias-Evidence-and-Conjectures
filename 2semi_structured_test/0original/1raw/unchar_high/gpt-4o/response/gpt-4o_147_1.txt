Given the information provided:

1. There are 75 successful computer science professors.
2. There are 25 successful humanities professors.

This means the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor at random is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Conversely, the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor at random is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description given does not provide specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors in this context. It mentions attributes like age, marital status, ability, motivation, and reputation, which could apply to successful professionals in either field.

Therefore, without additional specific information that would favor one field over the other, and given the prior probabilities, the best estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the base rate:

\[ P(Jason \text{ is a CS professor}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
