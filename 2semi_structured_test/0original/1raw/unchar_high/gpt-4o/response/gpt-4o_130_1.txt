Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, we know the overall composition of the sample:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Since no additional specific information is given that discriminates between computer science and humanities professors beyond the general description, we can assume that the description is equally likely to be chosen for a computer science or humanities professor. Therefore, the likelihoods P(Description | CS) and P(Description | Hum) are equal.

Given that the description alone provides no differential information, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is just the prior probability:

{"probability": "0.75"}
