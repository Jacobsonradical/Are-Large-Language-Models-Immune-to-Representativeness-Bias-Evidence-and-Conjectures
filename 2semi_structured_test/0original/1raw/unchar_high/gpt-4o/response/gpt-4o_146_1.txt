To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.
- A randomly chosen professor from the combined group of 100 professors.

We aim to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Since no additional information specific to either field is provided in the description, we assume that the description is equally likely for members of either group.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated based on the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is:
\( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Thus:

{"probability": "0.75"}
