To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to find a conditional probability when we know certain other probabilities. We'll use the following:

- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We assume that the details in Jason's description don't significantly affect the probability since the traits described can commonly be found in both disciplines. Thus, we don't have explicit likelihood values that differentiate between the fields, so we treat the likelihood \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | Hum) \) as effectively equal and cancel them out.

By applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

However, because likelihoods are considered equal and cancel out, we simplify as follows: 

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0
