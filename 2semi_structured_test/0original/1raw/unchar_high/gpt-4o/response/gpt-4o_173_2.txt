To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, you can use Bayes' theorem. For this problem, we need to consider the base rates (the initial proportions of each group) and the likelihood of the description fitting someone from each group.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We don't have any specific information in the description that makes Jason's profile more likely to fit one group over the other. Therefore, we can only rely on the base rates.

The base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description has an equal likelihood for both groups, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is proportional to the prior probability.

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Thus,
