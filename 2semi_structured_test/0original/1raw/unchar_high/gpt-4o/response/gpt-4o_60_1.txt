Given the random selection of one description from a pool of 100 professors (75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities), let us calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the information provided. 

Even though the description does not inherently favor one field over the other (high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation can apply broadly to both fields), the distribution of the sample must be considered.

First, calculate the proportion of computer science professors within the sample:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the initial probability, assuming no additional distinguishing information, is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
