To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how the calculation works:

1. **Total number of professors:** 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities).

2. **Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)):** 75/100 = 0.75

3. **Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)):** 25/100 = 0.25

Given that the description does not strongly favor either computer science or humanities, we assume that the probability of this description being assigned to a professor is independent of their field. Thus, without additional distinguishing characteristics, we can use the base rates as the estimate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
