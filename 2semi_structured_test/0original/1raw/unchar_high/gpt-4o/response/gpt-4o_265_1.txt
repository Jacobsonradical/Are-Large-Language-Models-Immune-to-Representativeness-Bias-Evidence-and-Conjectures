To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. But first, we need to understand the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

There are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

So the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
\[ \text{P(ComputerScience)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is:
\[ \text{P(Humanities)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider how the description matches the typical traits associated with either disciplines based on the information provided. While the description mentions Jasonâ€™s high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation, these traits are quite generic and could apply equally to professors in both fields. Given no specific traits highly indicative of computer science over humanities (or vice versa), we assume that the probability of someone having these traits is the same in both fields.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{P(ComputerScience | Description)} = \frac{\text{P(Description | ComputerScience)} \times \text{P(ComputerScience)}}{\text{P(Description)}} \]

Since \(\text{P(Description | ComputerScience)} \approx \text{P(Description | Humanities)}\) (assuming the description is equally likely for
