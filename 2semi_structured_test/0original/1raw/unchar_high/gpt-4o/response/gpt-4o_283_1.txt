To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's establish the relevant information:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of descriptions is 100.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event of the given description of Jason.

We need to determine \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming the description \( D \) is equally likely to describe a computer science professor and a humanities professor:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Since all descriptions are chosen randomly from the 100 descriptions, they are equally likely. Therefore, \( P(D|C) \
