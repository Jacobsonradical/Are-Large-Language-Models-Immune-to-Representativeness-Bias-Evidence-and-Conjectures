To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates provided by the study.

There are 100 professors in total:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Given only the description and the base rates, we don't have additional information to differentiate between the two groups except their proportions.

Using the base rate:
P(Computer Science) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
P(Humanities) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Since the description does not provide any distinguishing features that would favor one group over the other, we use the base rate probabilities directly.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
