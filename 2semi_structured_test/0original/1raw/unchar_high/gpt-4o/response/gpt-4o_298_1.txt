To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The initial probabilities are based on the ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the prior probabilities as follows:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Let's denote the event of the description fitting Jason as D. Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

To continue, we also need \( P(D) \), the overall probability of the description fitting any random individual. However, since we don't have the specific probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can make a simplifying assumption based on the equal likelihood of the description fitting any professor given limited data. This simplifies our comparison to just the prior probabilities.

Thus, based on the prior information alone, our best estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is
