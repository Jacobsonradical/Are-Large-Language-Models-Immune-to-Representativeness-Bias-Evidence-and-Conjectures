Given the description, we need to make a probability judgment based on the given information. The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, totaling 100 professors.

Firstly, let's compute the base rates for each group:
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor in the sample is from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor in the sample is from the humanities is 25/100 = 0.25.

In the absence of any compelling evidence that makes Jason's profile fit more with one group rather than the other, I will rely on these base rates. The description provided does not contain specific cues that would make Jason more likely to be from one academic discipline over the other.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the base rate for computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.75"}
