To solve this, we should use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Given that the total number of professors is 100 (75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities), the base rate probability that any randomly selected professor is from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

However, without more specific information from the description that correlates with either field, we will rely on these base rates since the description provided does not inherently favor either group over the other in a statistically significant manner.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
