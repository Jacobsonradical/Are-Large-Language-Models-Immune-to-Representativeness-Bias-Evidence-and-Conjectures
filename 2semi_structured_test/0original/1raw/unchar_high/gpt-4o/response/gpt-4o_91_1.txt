Given that the description does not provide specific information uniquely distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors, and that the total sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, you can employ Bayes' theorem or simply use the base rate approach.

The base rate approach looks at the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[
P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
