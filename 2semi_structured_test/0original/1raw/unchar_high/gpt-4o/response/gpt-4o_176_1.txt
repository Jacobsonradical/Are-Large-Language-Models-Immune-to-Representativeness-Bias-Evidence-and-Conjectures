To determine this probability, we should consider both the base rates of the two groups and the details provided about Jason.

Firstly, let's look at the base rates. The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that he is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider Jasonâ€™s description. However, as it lacks substantial discriminatory information between the two groups (e.g., specific traits or behaviors strongly associated with one group more than the other), it is difficult to update these probabilities meaningfully based on the given details. We can assume the description has an equal likelihood of being associated with either group. Therefore, we use only the base rates to estimate the probability.

Given this, the estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors would remain at:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is:
