Given the scenario, we can employ Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The descriptive profile of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Normalizing constant.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming the description \( D \) does not disproportionately favor either group, we consider \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D
