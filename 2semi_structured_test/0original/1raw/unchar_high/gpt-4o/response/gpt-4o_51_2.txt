The description provided (Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children, known for his high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by his colleagues, and enjoys a positive reputation) does not give any specific information that distinguishes his field of expertise between computer science and humanities.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as follows:

\[ 
\text{Probability (Jason is a computer science professor)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
