To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' Theorem, which can be articulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

The total sample consists of 100 professors: 75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities. Without further distinguishing information specific to Jason's description that would make it more likely to be in one group than the other, we can assume that the likelihood of any individual professor fitting Jason's description is roughly equal across both groups.

Given this, the prior probability \( P(A) \) (that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science) is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(A') \) (that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities) is:

\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description of Jason is equally likely among professors in both groups, \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \). Therefore, the likelihood ratio \( P(B|A) / P(B|A') \approx 1 \).
