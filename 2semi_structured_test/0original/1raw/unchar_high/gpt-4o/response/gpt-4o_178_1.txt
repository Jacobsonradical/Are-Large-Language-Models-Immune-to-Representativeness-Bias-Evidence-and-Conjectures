To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use the principles of Bayesian probability. We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the total sample of 100 professors.

We will calculate the probability using the formula for conditional probability:

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- B is the description of Jason.

To simplify the calculation, we assume the description provided does not favor either group more than the other. Therefore, P(B | A) for both groups is roughly equal.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given that the description does not provide additional discriminative information, we can assume that the likelihood ratios \( P(B | CS) \) and \( P(B | Hum) \) are roughly equal, hence canceling them out in our calculation. 

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability:

\( P(CS | B) \approx P(CS) = 0
