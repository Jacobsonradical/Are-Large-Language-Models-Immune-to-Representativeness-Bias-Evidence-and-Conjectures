To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

First, let's look at the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
This gives us a total of 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly selected professor comes from the computer science group is thus:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability that a randomly selected professor comes from the humanities group is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, since the description provided does not give any field-specific information and describes traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) that are likely to apply equally to successful professors in both fields, we can assume the description is equally likely for both groups.

Given these factors, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Simplified for equal likelihood given the description, it just considers the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.75" \]
