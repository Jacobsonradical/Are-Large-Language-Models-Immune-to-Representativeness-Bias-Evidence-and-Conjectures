To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must consider both the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample and the information given about Jason's personality and professional traits.

The sample consists of:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.

Hence, the probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that Jason has high ability, strong motivation, and is well-liked, these traits might be common among both computer science and humanities professors. Without more specific information correlating these traits uniquely to either field, the given traits do not alter the basic probabilities derived from the sample proportions.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Thus, the probability is given as:

{"probability": "0.75"}
