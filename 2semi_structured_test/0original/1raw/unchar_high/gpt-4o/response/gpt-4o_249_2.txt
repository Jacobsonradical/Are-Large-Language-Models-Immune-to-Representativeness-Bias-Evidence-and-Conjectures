Given the description of Jason and the total sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that he is one of the computer science professors.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Without any additional information, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is 25/100 = 0.25.

The description of Jason shares traits common to both fields (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues). Since this doesnâ€™t lead to a stronger indication for either field based on just this description, we can rely more heavily on the prior probabilities due to the larger number of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is relatively high, but not absolute:

{"probability": "0.75"}
