To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as Jason's description.

We are interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To simplify the calculation, let's assume the descriptions do not overly differ between the disciplines (i.e., \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \)). This is a simplification and might not hold in all real-world
