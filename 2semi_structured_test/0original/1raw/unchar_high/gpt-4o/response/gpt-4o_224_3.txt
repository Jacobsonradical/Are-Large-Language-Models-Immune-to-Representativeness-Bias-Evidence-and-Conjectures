Given the information that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

The description provided does not strongly suggest either field over the other. Therefore, there's no strong reason from the description alone to update the prior probability.

Given this, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors would remain 0.75.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
