To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to incorporate how many professors were interviewed from each domain:

- 75 professors from computer science
- 25 professors from the humanities

Since there are no specific traits in Jason's description that indicate a strong bias towards either field, we'll base our probability calculation on the proportion of professors from each domain.

The total number of professors is 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100 professors.

The probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
