To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider the base rates or proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

Out of the 100 professors:
- 75 are in computer science.
- 25 are in humanities.

We assume there is no additional information to differentiate Jason being specifically from either group based on his description alone. Therefore, we rely on the base rate.

The probability \( P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) \) is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
