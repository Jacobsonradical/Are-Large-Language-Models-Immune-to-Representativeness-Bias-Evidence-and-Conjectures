To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given evidence.

First, consider the prior probabilities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \). The prior probability that he is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the given description ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation") for both groups. Given that the description is quite general and does not strongly indicate a preference toward either group specifically:

If we assume the likelihood is the same for both groups for simplicity (a simplifying assumption without specific characteristics favoring one group):

Then by Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since the likelihood \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is assumed to be the same as \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \), it simplifies
