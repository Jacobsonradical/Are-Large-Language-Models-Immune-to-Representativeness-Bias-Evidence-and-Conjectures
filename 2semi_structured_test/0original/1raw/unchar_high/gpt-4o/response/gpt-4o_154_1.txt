To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to compare the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample. We were given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, making a total of 100 professors.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated as the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus the probability is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
