To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem. We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description does not provide any distinguishing features that would differentially favor one group over the other (i.e
