To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description overall.

Initially, since Jason is randomly chosen from 100 professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description provided does not favor either field specifically—that is, the description fits equally well for both a computer science professor and a humanities professor—then:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Since \( P
