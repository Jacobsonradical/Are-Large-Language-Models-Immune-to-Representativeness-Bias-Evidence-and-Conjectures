To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful in this context because it allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this study, we have:
- 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

Given these numbers, the prior probabilities (before considering the description) are:
- Probability that a professor is in computer science (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75.
- Probability that a professor is in the humanities (P(HUM)): 25/100 = 0.25.

Since we don't have specific evidence in the description that clearly distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume that the description applies equally to both groups. Therefore, the likelihood of observing this description given either category (P(description|CS) and P(description|HUM)) is the same.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability (P(CS|description)):

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Similarly, for the humanities:

\[ P(HUM|description) = \frac{P(description|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)}{P(description)} \]

However, since the likelihoods (P(description|CS) and P(description|HUM))
