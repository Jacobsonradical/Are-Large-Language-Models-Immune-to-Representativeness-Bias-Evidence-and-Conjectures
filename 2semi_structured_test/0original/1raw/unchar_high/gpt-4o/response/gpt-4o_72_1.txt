To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use the principles of probability and Bayesian inference.

- The total number of professors (computer science + humanities) interviewed: 75 + 25 = 100
- The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor: 75/100 = 0.75
- The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor: 25/100 = 0.25

Given the description, we don't have specific new evidence distinguishing computer science from humanities, so we can only rely on the prior probabilities based on their proportions in the sample.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the proportion of computer science professors among the total professors:

{"probability": "0.75"}
