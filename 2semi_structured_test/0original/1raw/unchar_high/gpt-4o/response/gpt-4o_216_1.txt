To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem, the probability \( P(A|B) \) is calculated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) : Jason has the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Calculate the prior probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of the total 100 professors.
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Calculate \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason having the given description if he is a computer science professor.
   - Without specific data about the likelihood of this description among the computer science professors, we assume the description is equally likely among all professors in the sample.
