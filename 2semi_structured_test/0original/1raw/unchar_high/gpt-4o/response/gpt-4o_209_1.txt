To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem in this context can be described as follows:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

However, without specific information on how likely this description is for computer science and humanities professors, we will make a simplifying assumption based on the relative number of professors in each category.

Given that 75 out of the 100 professors are in computer science and 25 out of the 100 professors are in the humanities:

- \( P(CS) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields:

- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)

Therefore:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) P(CS) + P(D | H) P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H
