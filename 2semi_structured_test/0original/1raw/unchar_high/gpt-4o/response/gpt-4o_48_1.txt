To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem in conjunction with the information provided.

First, let's summarize the given information:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- A description is chosen at random from these 100 descriptions.
- The description of Jason gives no specific details that indicate his field, only his ability, motivation, and reputation.

Since no prior information specifically indicates that Jason's description is more likely to be one of the computer science professors or the humanities professors, we can assume the descriptions are equally representative of the respective groups.

Given the ratio:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

Thus, the number of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, and the number of humanities professors is 25 out of 100.

The probability can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

So,
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
