To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Total Professors**: There are a total of 100 professors (75 computer science + 25 humanities).
2. **Prior Probability**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor belongs to the computer science group \(P(CS)\) is 75/100 or 0.75, and the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor belongs to the humanities group \(P(Hum)\) is 25/100 or 0.25.
3. **Likelihood**: Since the description does not provide specific information that would favor one group over the other, both groups (computer science and humanities professors) are assumed equally likely to match the description provided.

Given that the description alone does not differentiate between the two groups in terms of likelihood, we apply the base rate probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability \(P(CS|Description)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence,
