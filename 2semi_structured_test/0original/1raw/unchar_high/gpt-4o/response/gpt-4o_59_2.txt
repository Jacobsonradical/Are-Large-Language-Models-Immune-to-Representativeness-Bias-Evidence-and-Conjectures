To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem and some basic probability concepts.

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:
- The prior probability of someone being a computer science professor (P(CS)): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors. So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of someone being a humanities professor (P(H)): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors. So, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we know nothing else about Jason's traits that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors beyond the fact that he's successful and well-liked, which is common in both fields, we assume the description is equally likely for both categories.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS|D)) given the description D is proportional to the prior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}. \]

Given that P(D|CS) is the same as P(D|H), and the total probability P(D) is computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H). \]

Since
