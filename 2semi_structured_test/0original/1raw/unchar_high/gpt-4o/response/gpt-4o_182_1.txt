To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates prior probabilities and likelihoods.

First, we have the priors:

- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is:
\( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description of Jason, let's assume it is equally likely that a 30-year-old, married, childless professor with high ability, motivation, and a positive professional reputation could belong to either discipline (i.e., the description does not favor either group more than another). Thus, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(Desc | CS)\)) and the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(Desc | Hum)\)) can be considered roughly equal.

Under these circumstances, Bayes' theorem tells us that the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability:

{\ "probability" : "0.75"}
