Given the setup of your question, we have two main groups in the study: computer science professors (75 individuals) and humanities professors (25 individuals). The total number of professors is 100.

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information that would favor him being from one group over the other based on the personality traits listed, we rely on the base rates provided by the studyâ€”that is, the proportion of each group in the total sample.

The probability \(P(CS)\) that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated using the formula for conditional probability in this context, given the base rates:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Hence:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
