To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, based on the provided description and the numbers in each category, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of getting this description if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of getting this description if the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of getting this description.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to determine \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), but since we don't have specific details on how these probabilities compare, we can initially assume that the description is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors. 

Therefore:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) =
