To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that this description fits Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Given the data in the study:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS).
- There are 25 humanities professors (HU).
- The total number of professors is 100.

We assume that the probability of selecting any given professor is equal, so \( P(A) = P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{HU}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we don't have specific information that differentiates the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we assume \( P(B|\text{CS}) = P(B|\text{HU}) \).

By Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)}
\]

Since \( P(B|\text{CS}) \approx P(B|\text{HU}) \) and the total population must account for this, we reach:
