To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The base rates (prior probabilities) and a tiny bit of simplicity in assumption will help achieve that.

Out of the 100 professors:
- 75 are in computer science
- 25 are in humanities

Since we randomly chose one description from these 100 professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, based only on the provided information, can be calculated as follows:

Probability (P) that Jason is a computer science professor = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors

P(Jason is a computer science professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
