To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the study.

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description does not provide specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we will rely on the prior probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
