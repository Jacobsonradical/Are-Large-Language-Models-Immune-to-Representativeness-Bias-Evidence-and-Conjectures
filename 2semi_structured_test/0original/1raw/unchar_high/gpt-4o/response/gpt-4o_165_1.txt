To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample along with any relevant description features. 

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total: 100 professors 

Without additional specific information about Jason that distinctly points to either field, we rely on the base rates (the proportions of the two groups in the sample).

The probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be found using the formula for conditional probability:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

However, since the description provided does not particularly favor one field over the other (both fields presumably have high ability, motivation, and positive reputation), we can simplify aspects based on base rates:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
