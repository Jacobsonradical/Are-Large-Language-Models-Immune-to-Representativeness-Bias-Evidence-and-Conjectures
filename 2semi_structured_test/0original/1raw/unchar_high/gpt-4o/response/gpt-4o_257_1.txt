To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's set up the problem:

- Base rates:
  - There are 75 computer science professors.
  - There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors: 100

Given that there's no explicit information in the description that differentiates a computer science professor from a humanities professor, we'll consider the base rates only.

The base probability (prior probability) that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:
- Probability (Computer Science Professor) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

The base probability (prior probability) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
- Probability (Humanities Professor) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Since there's no additional distinguishing information provided in the description, we'll straightforwardly rely on the base rates described above.

Therefore,
{"probability": "0.75"}
