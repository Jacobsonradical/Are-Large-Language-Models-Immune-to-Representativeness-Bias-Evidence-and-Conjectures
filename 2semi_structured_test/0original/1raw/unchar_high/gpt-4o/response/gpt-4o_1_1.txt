To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll calculate the likelihood based on the given data:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.

Assuming there is no bias in the selection and the description equally fits any professor, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(\text{H}) \)) is:

\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since there is no additional information in Jason's description that would favor one discipline over the other, we consider that the likelihood of the description fitting any professor, regardless of the field, is the same.

Thus, using the total probability and equal likelihood principle, we can calculate:

\[ P(\text{CS | description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0
