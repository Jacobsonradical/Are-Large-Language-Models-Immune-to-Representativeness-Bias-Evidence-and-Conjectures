To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample. Here are the numbers:
- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in the humanities
- Total of 100 professors

Using Bayes' theorem and knowing nothing else specific to Jasonâ€™s description other than the initial probabilities, we can calculate:

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{computer science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
