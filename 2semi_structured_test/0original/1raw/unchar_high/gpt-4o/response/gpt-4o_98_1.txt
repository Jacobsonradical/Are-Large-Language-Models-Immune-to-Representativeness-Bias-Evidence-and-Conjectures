Given that Jason is selected randomly from the pool of 100 professors, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

We know the following:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

Since Jason is randomly chosen, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
