To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Humanities})\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   Given the description of Jason, we'll assume that the description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors because we have no specific information suggesting otherwise.

   So, the likelihood \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\) and \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})\) are both 1.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   By Bayes' Theorem, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Similarly, the probability of Jason being a humanities professor given the description is:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}|\text{Description
