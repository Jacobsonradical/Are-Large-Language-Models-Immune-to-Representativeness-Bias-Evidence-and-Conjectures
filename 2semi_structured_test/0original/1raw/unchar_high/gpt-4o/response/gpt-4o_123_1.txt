To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here, we are trying to find the probability given the prior information about the totals in the two categories.

The basic formula for conditional probability using Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, in this problem, given that we do not have explicit likelihoods \((P(B|A))\) but instead rely on the relative frequencies within the sample,

- The total sample size (number of professors) is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.

Given no additional specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors in the provided description, we assume a uniform distribution for all practical purposes.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the prior proportions, is simply the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

\[ P(\text{computer science}| \text{description}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Hence,

{"probability": "0.75"}
