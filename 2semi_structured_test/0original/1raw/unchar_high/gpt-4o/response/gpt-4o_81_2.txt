To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use the information provided in the problem and apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

This setup tells us that a professor chosen at random from the sample has a prior probability of \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) of being a computer science professor and a prior probability of \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) of being a humanities professor.

The description provided does not give specific details uniquely identifying the field, which means we should consider our prior probabilities as our best estimate.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
