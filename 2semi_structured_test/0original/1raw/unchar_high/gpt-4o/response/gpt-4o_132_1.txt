To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors among the 100 professors described, we need to apply Bayes' theorem and consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of the two groups.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) be the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, the prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- And the prior probability \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The given description of Jason provides no specific information that clearly distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors based on personality traits alone. Therefore, if we assume that the description given is equally likely for both groups, the probability that Jason belongs to either group will be proportional to the prior probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, in the absence of any distinguishing additional information, is simply the base rate for computer science professors:
