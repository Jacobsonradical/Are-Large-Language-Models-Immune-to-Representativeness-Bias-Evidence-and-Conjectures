{
    "probability": "0.75"
}

**Reasoning:**
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- This means that 75% of the professors are in computer science and 25% are in humanities.
- Without any other distinguishing information from the description provided, we should assume that the probability Jason is a computer science professor is proportional to the overall distribution in the sample.
- Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75%.
