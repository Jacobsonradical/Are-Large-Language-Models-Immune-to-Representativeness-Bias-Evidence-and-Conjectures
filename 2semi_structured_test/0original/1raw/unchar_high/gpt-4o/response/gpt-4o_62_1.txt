To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, I need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

There are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities. Therefore, the total number of professors is:

\[ 75 + 25 = 100 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
