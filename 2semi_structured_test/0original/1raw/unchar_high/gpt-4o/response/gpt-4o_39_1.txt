To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event described in the description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\# \text{ of computer science professors}}{\# \text{ of total professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \) (Jason is a humanities professor)**:
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B
