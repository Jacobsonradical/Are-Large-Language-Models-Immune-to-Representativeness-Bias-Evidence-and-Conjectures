To determine the probability, we will rely on the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.

There are 100 professors in total, of which 75 are from computer science and 25 are from the humanities. The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given no further specific information that differentiates Jason's description to definitively indicate one field over the other, we rely on this proportion. Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
