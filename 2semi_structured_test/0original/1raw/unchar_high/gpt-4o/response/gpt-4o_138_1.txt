To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

We know the following:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

The problem states that the description is chosen at random from these 100 descriptions, so without additional information about Jason's specific traits that might sway the probability, we only need to consider the base rates. The base rate probability for selecting a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
