To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem which involves prior and posterior probabilities.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason does not distinguish between being a computer science professor or a humanities professor and that the characteristics described are equally likely among both groups:

\[ P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (P(CS | description)) will be:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Since \( P(description) \) will be the same for both the computer science and humanities groups, it cancels out in the ratio computation. Thus:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac
