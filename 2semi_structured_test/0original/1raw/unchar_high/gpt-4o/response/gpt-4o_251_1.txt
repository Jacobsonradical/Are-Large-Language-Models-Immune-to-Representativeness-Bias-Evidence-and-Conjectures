To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. However, for simplicity, we can also use the basic principle of proportion, given that the description doesn't provide us with specific distinguishing features between computer science and humanities professors.

We know from the study that there are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

This gives us a total of 100 professors.

The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from this group is calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
