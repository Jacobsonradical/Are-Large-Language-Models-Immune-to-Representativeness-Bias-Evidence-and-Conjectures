To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

Firstly, we know there are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors. So, initially, without any additional information, the probability that Jason is a CS professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Correspondingly, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, let's say the description provided is the evidence (E). According to the problem, we need to determine \( P(CS \mid E) \), the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E \mid CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since we don't have specific information suggesting that one group is more likely than another to fit this description, we'll assume that the description is equally likely to fit a person from either
