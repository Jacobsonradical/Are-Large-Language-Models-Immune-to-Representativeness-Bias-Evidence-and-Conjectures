To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so the prior probability for a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability for a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description provided does not offer distinctive features that strongly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, so we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. This implies that the likelihood of getting this description given Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the likelihood of getting this description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Thus, we can use the prior probabilities directly:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(\text{Description}) }
\]
Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) would be the same for both types of professors, it cancels out. Therefore:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{ P(\text{CS}) }{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})}
\]

Given the equal likelihood assumption, the formula simplifies
