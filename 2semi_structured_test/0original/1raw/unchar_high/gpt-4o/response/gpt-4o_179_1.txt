To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we need to consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- A random description was chosen from these 100 professors.

The base rate probability that a randomly selected professor description belongs to a computer science professor is:

\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

The base rate probability that a randomly selected professor description belongs to a humanities professor is:

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Since we know nothing additional about Jason apart from the description provided, which does not distinguish clearly between computer science and humanities, we rely solely on these base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
