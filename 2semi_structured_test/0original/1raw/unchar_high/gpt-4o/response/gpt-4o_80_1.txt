Given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Starting with the base rates**:
   - Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
   - Number of humanities professors (HUM): 25
   - Total number of professors (Total): 100

2. **Base Rate Probability**:
   - Probability (CS) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75
   - Probability (HUM) = Number of HUM professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25

3. **Given the problem statement**:
   - The description of Jason doesn't provide specific information that differentiates between a computer science professor and a humanities professor. We assume that the description's probability of matching someone in CS or HUM is equal, given no distinguishing traits.
   - As there is no additional specific information, we rely on the base rates.

Since we are relying purely on base rates (assuming descriptions are not more likely for one group over the other), the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group is 0.75.

Therefore, the probability is:
