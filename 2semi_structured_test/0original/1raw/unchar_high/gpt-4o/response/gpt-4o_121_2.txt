To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates (the number of professors in each group) since the description does not provide specific information favoring one discipline over the other.

Given:
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

This makes a total of 100 professors. The proportion of computer science professors is 75 out of 100, and the proportion of humanities professors is 25 out of 100.

Using these base rates, we calculate the probability:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
