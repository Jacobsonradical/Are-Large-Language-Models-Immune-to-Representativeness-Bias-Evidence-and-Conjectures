To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since the description does not provide any information specifically favoring either discipline, we will rely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

The total number of professors is 100, with 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities.

P(computer science) = 75/100 = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
