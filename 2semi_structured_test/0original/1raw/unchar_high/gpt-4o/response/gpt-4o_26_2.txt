To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider both the base rates of the two groups and the information provided about his personality. Let's break this down:

1. **Base Rate (Prior Probability):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly, P(CS), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly, P(H), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Given Information:**
   - The description does not give specific information that clearly differentiates between a computer science professor and a humanities professor.

Given the lack of specific distinguishing information in Jason's description, we rely primarily on the base rates to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
