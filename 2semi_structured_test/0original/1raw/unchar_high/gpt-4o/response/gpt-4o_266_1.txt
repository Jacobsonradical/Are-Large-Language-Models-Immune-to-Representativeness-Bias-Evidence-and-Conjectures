Given the information, we know the number of professors in each group and need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making a total of 100 professors.

We need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given that he is a professor in the sample.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the following formula:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

Substituting the given numbers:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
