To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Given:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- No specific information in Jason's description ties him to either field explicitly.

Here's the calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood of the Description**:
   - We assume there is no bias in the given description that tips the scale towards either field. Since it is equally likely that a positive and motivated professor with this profile could be from either discipline, the likelihood ratio is \( 1 \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     Considering \( P(\text{Description}) \) would normalize the equation over both disciplines:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})
