To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The relevant information includes:

- 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science Professor} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science Professor})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since we have no reason to believe that a given description would be more likely to match either group and given that the description does not differentiate between the fields, we assume:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science Professor}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities Professor}) \)

Thus, the probability simplifies to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science Professor} | \text{Description}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
