Given the information, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description.

First, let's denote the number of computer science professors (\( CS \)) and humanities professors (\( H \)):

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100.

To compute the probability that Jason is from the computer science group (\( P(CS|Description) \)), we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without specific details indicating differences in descriptions between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume the description given is equally likely for both groups.

Using the base rate, the prior probability for Jason to be a computer science professor is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, based solely on the prior probabilities, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
