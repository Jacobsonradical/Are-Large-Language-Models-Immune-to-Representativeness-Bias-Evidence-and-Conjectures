To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use the concept of base rates from probability theory.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The total number of professors is 100. We do not have specific information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors based solely on Jason's description, so we will rely on the base rates of each group.

The base rate probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.75" \]
