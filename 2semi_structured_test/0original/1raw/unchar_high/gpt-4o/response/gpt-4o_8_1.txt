Given the information:

- The total number of professors in the sample is 100: 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities.
- We have no specific personality or professional details that bias our decision towards one group over the other.

Let's calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

The probability \( P \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
