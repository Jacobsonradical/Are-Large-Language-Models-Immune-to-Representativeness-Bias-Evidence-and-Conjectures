To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given no additional specific information that clearly distinguishes Jason as belonging to one group over the other, the best estimate is the base rate itself.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
