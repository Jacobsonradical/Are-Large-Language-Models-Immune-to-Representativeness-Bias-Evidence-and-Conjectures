To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason has the described characteristics.

First, we need to determine the following:

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor. This is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
2. **P(B|A)**: The probability that Jason has the described characteristics given that he is a computer science professor.
3. **P(B)**: The overall probability that Jason has the described characteristics.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **P(A)**:
   The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **P(B|A)**:
   This is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor. Without additional specific information on how characteristics differ between fields, we might assume that descriptions are equally likely for both types of professors. Thus, we might assume:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 1 \]

3. **P(B)**:
   This is the total
