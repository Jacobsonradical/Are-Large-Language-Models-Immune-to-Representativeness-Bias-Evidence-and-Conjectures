To calculate the probability, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description "known for his high ability and strong motivation" is equally likely to describe a computer science professor as it is to describe a humanities professor (an assumption needed for the calculation because we lack further information), the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) (where D is the description) are the same.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \) is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since the description is equally likely for both groups, \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \). Letâ€™s call this common probability \( P(D) \).

\[ P
