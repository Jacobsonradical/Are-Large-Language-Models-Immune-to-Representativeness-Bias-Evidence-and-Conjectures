To determine the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem requires us to consider both prior probabilities and the evidence presented.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   Given the description, we need to assess the likelihood that Jason's traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) appear similarly in both groups. Without specific data on how these traits are distributed among the two groups, we typically assume that there is no significant difference between the groups concerning these traits unless specified otherwise.

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   Since the traits provided are general and can be considered equally likely across both groups, the likelihood (the descriptive evidence) doesn't change the prior probabilities. Therefore, we can simplify this to say:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability for selecting a computer science professor.

\[ P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Hence,

{"probability": "0.75"}
