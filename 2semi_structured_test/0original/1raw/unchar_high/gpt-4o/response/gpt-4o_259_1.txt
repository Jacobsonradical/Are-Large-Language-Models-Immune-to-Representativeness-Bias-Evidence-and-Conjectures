Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, we can use the base rates to calculate our probability. Assuming there is no additional distinguishing information specific to the disciplines from the description provided, we can use these base rates directly.

The total number of professors is 100, and 75 out of these are computer science professors, so the base rate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 or 0.75.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
