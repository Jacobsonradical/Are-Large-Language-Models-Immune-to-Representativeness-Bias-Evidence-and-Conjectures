To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason provided.

We are trying to find \( P(CS|D) \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Since we don't have specific information about \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we'll assume the description \( D \) is equally likely given either profession, i.e., \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Next, we calculate the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100
