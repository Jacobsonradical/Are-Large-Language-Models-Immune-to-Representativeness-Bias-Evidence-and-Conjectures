Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayesian inference. 

The base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we do not have any additional specific information about the traits that distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors in the given description, we will use the base rates as our probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
