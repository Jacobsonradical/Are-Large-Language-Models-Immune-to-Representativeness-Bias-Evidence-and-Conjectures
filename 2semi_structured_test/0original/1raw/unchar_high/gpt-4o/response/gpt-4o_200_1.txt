To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the relative sizes of the two groups in the sample and any potential biases from the description. However, since the description provided doesn't include particular traits that heavily favor one group over the other, we primarily rely on the proportion of each group in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\). Similarly, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given that the description doesn't particularly favor one discipline over the other, we'll treat the probability of drawing this description from either group as roughly equal.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
