Given the data provided, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. When choosing a description at random, each professor has an equal chance of being selected.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated based on the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
