{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is derived from the base rate of the sample. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability that Jason is from the computer science group, without additional distinguishing information, is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors. This is 75 out of 100, which simplifies to a probability of 0.75.
