Given that the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability (before considering any additional detail from Jason's description) of Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason being highly able, strongly motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation does not provide specific information that would favor computer science professors over humanities professors.

Considering that the description does not give further differentiating information, we should rely on the base rate provided by the sample sizes.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample remains:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability is:
