To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way of updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired. However, in this case, we don't have enough specific information about how personality traits are distributed between the two groups (computer science and humanities professors). Thus, we must rely on the base rates provided in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making up a total of 100 professors. The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given we randomly choose one professor from these 100, is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability is calculated as follows:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Using this information, my response would be:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
