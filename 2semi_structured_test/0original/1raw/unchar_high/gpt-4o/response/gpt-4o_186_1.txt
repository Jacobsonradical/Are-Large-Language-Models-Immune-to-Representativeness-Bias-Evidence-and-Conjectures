To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to consider the total number of professors and the number in each group:
   - Computer Science (CS) professors: 75
   - Humanities professors: 25
   - Total professors: 100

2. We know that Jason is one of the 100 professors. The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors: 

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. The probability that Jason is a humanities professor before considering the description is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

4. The description itself ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation") does not provide any specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors. Therefore, we can assume that the likelihood of such a description being applicable to a computer science professor is the same as it being applicable to a humanities professor.

Since the likelihood of the description doesn't favor one group over the other
