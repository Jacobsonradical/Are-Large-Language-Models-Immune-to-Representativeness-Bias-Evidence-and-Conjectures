To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample and assume that the description given is equally likely to describe individuals in either group (computer science or humanities).

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making a total of 100 professors.

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from this sample is a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
