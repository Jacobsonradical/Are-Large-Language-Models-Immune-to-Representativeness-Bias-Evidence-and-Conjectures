To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is \( P(CS) \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group is \( P(Hum) \).

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the priors are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description of Jason provides no specific information that distinguishes between the two groups, we need to assume that the likelihood of a given description being used for a computer science professor is the same as it being used for a humanities professor. Therefore, the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) are equal and cancel out in Bayes' theorem.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \) and they cancel out, the formula simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]
\[
