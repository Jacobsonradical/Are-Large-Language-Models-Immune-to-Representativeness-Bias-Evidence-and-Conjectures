To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the information:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

Since the description of Jason doesn't give us any direct distinguishing features between the two groups, we'll assume that the probability of the description given either group is equal:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Because we assume \( P(B|A) =
