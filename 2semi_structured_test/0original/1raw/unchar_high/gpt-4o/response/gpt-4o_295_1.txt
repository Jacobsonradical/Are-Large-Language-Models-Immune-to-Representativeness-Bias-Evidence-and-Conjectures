To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We know the following:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The description is randomly chosen from all 100 professors.

The prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(H) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25

The likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor is not explicitly given, so we assume that the description is equally likely for any successful academic irrespective of their field.

Since we are given no reason to believe that the description fits one group more than the other, we can assume:

P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H) = 1

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(CS | Description) = [P(Description | CS) * P(CS)] / P(Description)

Since P(Description) is the same for both fields, it cancels out, simplifying to:

P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.75

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
