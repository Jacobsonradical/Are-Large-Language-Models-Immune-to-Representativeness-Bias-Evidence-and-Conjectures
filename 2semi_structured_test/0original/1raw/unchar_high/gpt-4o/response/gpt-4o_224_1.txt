To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description of Jason, we need to take into account the number of professors in each field (computer science vs. humanities) and balance it with the overall probability of being in either group.

1. \( P(\text{CS}) \) - Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
2. \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) - Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given no other information that distinguishes Jason significantly between the two groups, we assume that the description applies equally likely across both groups.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description}) \) would be the same across both groups and hence can be canceled out, we focus on comparing the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.
