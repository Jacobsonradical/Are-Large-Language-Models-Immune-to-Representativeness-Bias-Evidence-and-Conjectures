To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to compare the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Using basic probability, the probability \( P \) that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
