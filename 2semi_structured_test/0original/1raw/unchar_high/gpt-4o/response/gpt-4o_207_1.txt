To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- 75 computer science professors (CS)
- 25 humanities professors (H)
- A total of 100 professors

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS | Description)), given the description.

Bayes' Theorem formula: 

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from humanities.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Description | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H) \)

Assuming there are no strong indications in the description favoring one field over the other beyond general traits of high ability, motivation, and professional reputation - traits common to successful professors in both fields - we can simplify the problem. 

So:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.
