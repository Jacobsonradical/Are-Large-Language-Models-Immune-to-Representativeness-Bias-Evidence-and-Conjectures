To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's employ Bayesian reasoning incorporating the base rates of the two groups of professors.

1. The total number of professors in the study is 100.
2. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The initial (prior) probability that a randomly selected professor from the study is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The initial (prior) probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description of Jason does not provide distinctive information that would clearly differentiate whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Without additional specific characteristics that lean towards one group over the other, we maintain the prior probabilities.

Therefore, based on the prior probability alone:

\[ \text{Probability that Jason is a computer science professor} = 0.75 \]

Here is the final answer in the required format:
