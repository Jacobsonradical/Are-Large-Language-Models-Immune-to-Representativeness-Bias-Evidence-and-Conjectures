To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Given:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- We have no additional information to suggest that the personality traits described are more likely in one group than the other.

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without any specific information in the description that would make one discipline more likely than the other, and treating the description as neutral, the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor aligns with the prior probability.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
