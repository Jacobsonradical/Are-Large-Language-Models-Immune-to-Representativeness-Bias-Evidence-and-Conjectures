To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We are given that there are:

- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given no additional specific distinguishing information about the personality traits linking more strongly to one field than the other, we can assume equal likelihood based on the sample size. Hence, the base rates are:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since there is no additional information making Jason more likely to belong to one group over the other based on the description alone, we do not need to adjust these base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
