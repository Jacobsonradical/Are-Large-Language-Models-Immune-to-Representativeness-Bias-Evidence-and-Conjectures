To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider both the base rates and the given description. 

First, let's look at the base rates: there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. This means that before considering the description, the probability of selecting a computer science professor is 75/100 and the probability of selecting a humanities professor is 25/100.

However, the description of Jason does not provide specific information that would significantly distinguish between professors in computer science and those in the humanities. Both groups could reasonably have individuals who are highly able, motivated, well-liked, and have a positive reputation.

Given that the description is equally plausible for both groups, we rely on the base rates.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
