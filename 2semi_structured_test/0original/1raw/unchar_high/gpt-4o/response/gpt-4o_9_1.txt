Given the information provided, we need to calculate the probability that Jason belongs to the group of computer science professors. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here's a breakdown of the given information:
1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. A description was chosen at random from these 100 descriptions.
3. Based on the description, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem can be applied here:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

However, we will simplify based on the fact that the description does not provide any specific traits that are unique to either group. Instead, we will rely on the proportions of the groups.

The probability \(P(\text{CS})\) is the prior probability that any given person is a computer science professor:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the probability \(P(\text{Humanities})\) is the probability that any given person is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not give us a distinguishing feature to affect the prior probabilities, we can
