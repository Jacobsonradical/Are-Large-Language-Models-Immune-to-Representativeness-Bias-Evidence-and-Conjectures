To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to consider the base rates or prior probabilities. 

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

This gives us the following prior probabilities:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25

Since we are not given any specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors based solely on the description of Jason, we assume that the description applies equally to both groups. Hence, the likelihood of receiving the description of Jason given that he is a computer science professor is equal to the likelihood of receiving the description of Jason given that he is a humanities professor.

Therefore, using these prior probabilities directly in this context:

- The likelihood of being given this description regardless of the field (P(Description)) remains the same since the descriptions are given randomly from the pool of 100 professors. 

Given no additional distinctive features in Jason's description to favor one group over the other, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor follows directly from the base rate probabilities:

{"probability": "0.75"}
