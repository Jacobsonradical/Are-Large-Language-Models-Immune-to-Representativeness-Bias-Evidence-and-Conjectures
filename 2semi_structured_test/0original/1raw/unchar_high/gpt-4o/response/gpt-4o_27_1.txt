Given the description of Jason, we need to calculate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors. We can use Bayes' theorem for this, but we need to consider that the description provided does not give us specific information that would strongly differentiate between the two groups. Therefore, we primarily rely on the base rates of the groups, which are:

- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

Using the base rates, the proportion of computer science professors is 75 out of 100. This means the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the proportion of humanities professors is 25 out of 100. This means the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

In the absence of additional distinguishing information in the description, we assume that the likelihood of any particular description being produced is roughly the same for both groups of professors. This simplifies our calculation and allows us to use the base rates directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, is:

\[ P(CS|description) = P(CS) =
