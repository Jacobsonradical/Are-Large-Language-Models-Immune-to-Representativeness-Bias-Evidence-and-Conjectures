To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider both the base rates of the two groups and the description provided.

First, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample:

- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Assuming the description provided is equally likely for both groups based on the information given, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using Bayes' theorem, which, for this simplified case, remains the same as the base rate due to lack of differentiating evidence in the provided description.

So,

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
