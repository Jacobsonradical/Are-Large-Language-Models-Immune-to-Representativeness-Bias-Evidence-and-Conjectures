To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
  - 75 of them are from computer science.
  - 25 of them are from the humanities.

The description of Jason does not provide any information that differentiates between the characteristics of computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we assume that the likelihood of being described as Jason is equally probable for both groups.

According to the principle of indifference, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)): 25/100 = 0.25

Since the description does not add different likelihoods for the two groups, we maintain these prior probabilities. Thus, the probability that Jason is from the computer science group is 0.75.
