Given the provided description of Jason, and recognizing that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, there are two pieces of information to consider:

1. The base rate of computer science professors is higher than that of humanities professors (75 vs 25 out of 100).
2. The description provided does not give any specific information that would strongly indicate whether Jason belongs to one group or the other.

We can use Bayesian reasoning to combine these pieces of information. The base rate implies that there's a higher preexisting likelihood that any randomly chosen professor from this sample is from computer science rather than humanities.

Using these base rates, the probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{75+25} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without any additional distinguishing information from the description that would adjust this prior probability, we use this ratio.

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
