To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new information. Here, we have the total numbers of professors in each discipline and no specific details in the description that directly point to one discipline over the other.

First, let's summarize the data:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100. Since we are choosing one description at random, the base probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor without any additional information is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the base probability \( P(B) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that there is no specific information in Jason's description to suggest it is more likely for computer science or humanities (both descriptions equally fit general plausible profiles for either field), these base probabilities are reasonable.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
