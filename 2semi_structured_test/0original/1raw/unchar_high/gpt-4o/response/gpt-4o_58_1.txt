Given the sample size of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we first calculate the base rate probabilities for each group:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given no other information (prior probability): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, given no other information (prior probability): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that distinctly aligns better with either group, and therefore does not update our prior probabilities significantly. As a result, we can approximate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
