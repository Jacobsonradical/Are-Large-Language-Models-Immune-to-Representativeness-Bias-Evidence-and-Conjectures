Given that the description provided fits a person who could reasonably be either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we need to consider the proportions of each group in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated using the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} \]

\[ P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
