Assuming we have no prior information other than the description given, we rely on the base rates of the two groups (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors). Given these numbers, the total probability space has 100 individuals, of which 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the base rate of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the response would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
