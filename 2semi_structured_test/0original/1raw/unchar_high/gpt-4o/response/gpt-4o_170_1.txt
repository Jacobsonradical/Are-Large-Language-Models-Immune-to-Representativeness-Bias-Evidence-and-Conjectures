To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here is the setup with the given numbers:

- The total number of professors is 100.
- 75 of these are computer science professors.
- 25 of these are humanities professors.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that a professor has Jason's description.

First, we need to find \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \):

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of obtaining Jason's description. Since we don't have reasons to believe Jason's description is more likely in one field over the other, let's assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are roughly equal and both refer to the likelihood of having such a description irrespective of the field.

For simplicity and lack of additional data, letâ€™s consider that such a description equally describes both fields:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P
