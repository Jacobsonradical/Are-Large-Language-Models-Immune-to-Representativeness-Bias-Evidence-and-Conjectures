To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the relevant numbers:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75 out of 100 professors are computer science professors.
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)): 25 out of 100 professors are humanities professors.

Since the description does not provide specific details that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since the description is equally likely for both groups:

\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \]

Thus:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{75/100}{75/100 + 25/100} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
