Given the description and the composition of the study sample, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

From the given study sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description does not inherently favor either discipline, we assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). Given that, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C)
