Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample of 100 professors, we can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that a randomly selected professor described as Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- Probability (P) that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science (CS): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability (P) that any randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (H): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we do not have additional information specific to whether Jason is in computer science or the humanities beyond the given description (which seems generally applicable to successful academics), our posterior probability is the same as our prior probability:

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
