To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the proportions of the two groups in the study.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Hence, the total number of professors is:

\[ 75 + 25 = 100 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given no additional information about Jason that explicitly distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we should base our probability estimate on these proportions.

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
