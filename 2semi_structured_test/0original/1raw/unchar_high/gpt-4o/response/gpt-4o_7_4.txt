Given that we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability.

First, let's calculate the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description provided does not contain any specific information strongly favoring one group of professors over the other in terms of discipline (computer science vs. humanities), we can assume that the description is equally likely to be written about a professor from either group.

So we do not need to update our prior probabilities based on the description.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
