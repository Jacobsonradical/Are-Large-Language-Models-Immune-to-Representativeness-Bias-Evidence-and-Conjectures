To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample and whether the description provides any differentiating information between the two groups. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Given that we have no information in the description that clearly distinguishes between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we can rely on the base rates of each group.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS|Description)\)) is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.

\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
