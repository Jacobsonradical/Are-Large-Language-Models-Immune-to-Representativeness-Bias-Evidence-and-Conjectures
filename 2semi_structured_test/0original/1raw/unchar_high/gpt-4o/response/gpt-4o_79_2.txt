Given the information about the study, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Without any other biases or additional information specific to Jason that points strongly towards one group over the other, we can use the base rates (prior probabilities) of 75% for computer science professors and 25% for humanities professors.

Here is the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Total number of professors:** 100
2. **Number of computer science professors:** 75
3. **Number of humanities professors:** 25
4. **Base probability of selecting a computer science professor:** \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
5. **Base probability of selecting a humanities professor:** \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description of Jason doesn't provide any specific, distinguishable characteristics that are more closely aligned with either computer science or humanities professors, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be seen as proportional to the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
