To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the study and the description provided, assuming that the description does not favor one group over the other.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability (before considering the description) is:

P(Computer Science) = 75/100 = 0.75\
P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Since the description provided does not give any specific information that would differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we assume that the likelihood of either group fitting the description is the same. Thus, the ratio of the probabilities remains based on the initial distribution.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.75"}
