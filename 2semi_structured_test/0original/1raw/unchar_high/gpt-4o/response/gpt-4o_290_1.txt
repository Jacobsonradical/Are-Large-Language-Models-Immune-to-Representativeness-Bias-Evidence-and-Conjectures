To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Given:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's description does not provide any specific distinguishing traits that seem more likely to be associated with either of the fields. 

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability is calculated based solely on the proportion of the groups in the sample, as we lack additional distinctive information. Here's the calculation:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since the description appears equally likely to apply to both groups, \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Humanities) \) are considered to be equal. Therefore, the probability simplifies to the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75, or 75%.
