To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem involves calculating the posterior probability based on prior probabilities and likelihoods.

First, let's define some terms:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description being given if the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description being given if the professor is in the humanities.

We start by determining the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, since we have no specific additional information suggesting that the description is more or less likely to apply to professors from either field, we will assume that the description of Jason being highly able, motivated, and well-liked is equally likely for both groups. Hence, \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \).

By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \
