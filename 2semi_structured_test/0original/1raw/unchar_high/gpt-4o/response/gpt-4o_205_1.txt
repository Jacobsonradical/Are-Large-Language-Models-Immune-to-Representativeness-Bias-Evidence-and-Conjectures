To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. We know the total number of professors in the sample is 100 (75 computer science and 25 humanities).
2. We must assume that the description provided does not inherently favor either group since it is common for both.

The probability that Jason is from the computer science category (P(CS)) is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the probability that Jason is from the humanities category (P(H)) is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not provide any additional bias towards either group, we use the prior probabilities directly. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
