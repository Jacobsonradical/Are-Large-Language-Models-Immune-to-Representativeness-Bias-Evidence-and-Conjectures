To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimates given new evidence.

First, let's establish the base rates:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 75 + 25 = 100.

To find the initial (prior) probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

However, we do not have specific conditional probabilities provided about how likely Jason's traits are given either profession. If we assume that the description given (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) is equally likely for both groups (i.e., doesn't favor one profession over the other), we can proceed without adjusting the base rates.

Therefore, using just the base rates, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given our assumption that the description does not favor one group over the other:
\[ P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \]

So
