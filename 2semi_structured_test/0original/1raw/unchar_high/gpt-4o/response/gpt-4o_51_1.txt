To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \) be the evidence described about Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation).

We want to find \( P(C|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E|C) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \(
