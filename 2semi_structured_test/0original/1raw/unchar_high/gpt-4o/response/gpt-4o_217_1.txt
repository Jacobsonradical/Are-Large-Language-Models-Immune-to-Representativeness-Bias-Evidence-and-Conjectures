Given the nature of the study and the numbers provided, we can use Bayesian principles to determine the probability. We start by evaluating the base rates:

- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

This gives us a base rate of 75/100 for computer science professors and 25/100 for humanities professors.

We have no additional specific indication, from the description alone, that would make Jason more likely to be in one field over the other, meaning the description doesn't provide differentially diagnostic information for one group versus the other.

Thus, our probability calculation is mainly driven by the base rates:

Probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
P(CS) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors
       = 75 / 100
       = 0.75

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
