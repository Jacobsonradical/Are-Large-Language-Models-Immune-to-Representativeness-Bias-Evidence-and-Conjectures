To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use the information regarding the distribution of the professors in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 

The total number of professors is:
\[ 75 + 25 = 100 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor from this sample is a computer science professor can be calculated as the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ \text{Probability} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
