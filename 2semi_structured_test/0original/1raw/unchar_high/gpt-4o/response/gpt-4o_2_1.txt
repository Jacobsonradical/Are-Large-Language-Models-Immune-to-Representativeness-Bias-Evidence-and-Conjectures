To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Specifically, we can use the base rates of the two groups of professors in the sample.

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

This gives the following base rates:
- Probability of a professor being in computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of a professor being in the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors, so we assume the probability of receiving such a description given either group is the same.

Therefore, using just the base rates, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is still \(0.75\).

Given this reasoning, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
