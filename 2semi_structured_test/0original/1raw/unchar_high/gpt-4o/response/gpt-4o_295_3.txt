To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Total Number of Professors:**
   - 75 computer science professors
   - 25 humanities professors
   - Total: 100 professors

2. **Bayes' Theorem Formula:**
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

   Where:
   - \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (i.e., before considering the description).
   - \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

3. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

4. **Assumption about Descriptions:**
   Since the description provided does not clearly favor one group over the other and seems neutral:
   - \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{H})
