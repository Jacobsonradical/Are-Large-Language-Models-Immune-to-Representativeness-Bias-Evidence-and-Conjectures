Given that there are 100 professors in total (75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities), and assuming there are no other specific distinguishing features in the description that strongly indicate Jason's field, we should consider the base rates of each group.

Based on the base rates:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Since the description does not provide conclusive evidence favoring either group over the base rates, the best estimate would be to use the base rates directly.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
