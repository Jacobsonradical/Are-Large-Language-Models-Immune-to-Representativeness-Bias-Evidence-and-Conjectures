To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use the given information about the number of professors in each field.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, making a total of 100 professors. Since Jason was chosen randomly from these 100 professors, we can use the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors to calculate the probability.

The probability \( P \) that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{Jason is a CS professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the formatted answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
