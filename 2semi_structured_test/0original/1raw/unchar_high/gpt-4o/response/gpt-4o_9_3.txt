Given the setup of the study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. We need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Since Jason was chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, the probability that he is one of the 75 computer science professors can be directly calculated by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The probability \( P(Jason \text{ is a computer science professor}) \) is given by:

\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

Substituting the given numbers:

\[ P = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
