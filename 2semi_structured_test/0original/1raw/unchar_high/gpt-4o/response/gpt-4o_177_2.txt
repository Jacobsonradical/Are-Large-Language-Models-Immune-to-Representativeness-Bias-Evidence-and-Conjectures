To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event corresponding to the given description.

We are given:
- The total number of professors is 100, with 75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities.

So, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that a professor chosen at random is from computer science is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Without any strong differentiators in the description favoring one department over the other, we assume that the description is as likely for computer science professors
