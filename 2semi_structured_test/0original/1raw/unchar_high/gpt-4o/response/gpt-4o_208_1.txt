Given the scenario, we are tasked with estimating the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is therefore computed by the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

To compute this in probabilistic terms, we use the following formula:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
