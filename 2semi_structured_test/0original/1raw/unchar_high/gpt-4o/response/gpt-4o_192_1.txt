To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(\text{CS}) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(\text{Hum}) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - The description of Jason doesnâ€™t seem to heavily favor one field over the other. It describes general traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, which could apply to professors in both fields. 

Without additional information suggesting that the description fits one field more closely than the other, we treat the likelihood of Jason's traits appearing in professors from both fields as equal.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   Using Bayes' theorem, we typically need specific likelihoods. However, given our assumption that Jason's description fits equally to both fields, the likelihood ratio is 1 (or they cancel out):

   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{
