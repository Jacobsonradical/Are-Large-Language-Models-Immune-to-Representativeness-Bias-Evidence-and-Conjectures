To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the populations concerned.

The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

Given that Jason is a randomly chosen professor from this group, the initial probability of him being a computer science professor can be calculated based on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, without any additional specific information beyond the given description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
