To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new information.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \) as the probability of the given description for a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) as the probability of the given description for a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \) as the overall probability of getting this description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We want to find \( P(CS | Desc) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

We need to estimate \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc
