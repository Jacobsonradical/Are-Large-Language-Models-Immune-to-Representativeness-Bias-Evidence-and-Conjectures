Given that you didn't restrict the use of additional information, we can apply Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let’s denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of the description.

The priors \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) are based on the sample sizes:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To find \( P(D) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) P(CS) + P(D | H) P(H) \]

Since we don't have specific details to distinguish Jason's description between the two groups, we’ll assume for simplicity that the probability of the description \( P(D
