Based on the provided information, we know the following:

- Total number of professors in the study: 100 (75 in computer science + 25 in humanities)
- The description of Jason includes characteristics such as high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation.

However, without specific information directly linking Jason's traits to a particular field more prevalently, we would rely on the general probabilities based on the sample sizes.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors:

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as follows:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is 0.75.

{"probability": "0.75"}
