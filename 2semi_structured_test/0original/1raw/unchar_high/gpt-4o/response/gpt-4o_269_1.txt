Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, we should use the relative proportions of these groups to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

Since the description does not lean towards characteristics that are significantly more common in one discipline than the other (e.g., his high ability, motivation, and positive reputation could apply to both disciplines), we will rely primarily on the base rates.

The sample has 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is therefore:

\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
