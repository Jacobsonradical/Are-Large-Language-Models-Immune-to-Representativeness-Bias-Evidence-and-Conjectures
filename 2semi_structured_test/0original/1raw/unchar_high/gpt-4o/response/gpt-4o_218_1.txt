To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of the 100 professors in total.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \):

Firstly, note the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[
P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(\text{Hum}) \) for the humanities professors is:
\[
P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given that the description does not provide any particular insight that distinguishes it as more likely related to either computer science or humanities, we assume that the likelihood \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is equal to \( P(\text{description} | \text{Hum}) \).

Therefore, if we denote the likelihood ratio as \( k \), in this case \( k = 1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \):
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P
