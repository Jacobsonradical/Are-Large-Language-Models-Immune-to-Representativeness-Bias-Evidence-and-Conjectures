To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning, taking into account the number of professors in each group.

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- It's equally likely that the description could be from any of these 100 professors.

Since we have no additional distinguishing information about Jason that would favor him being from one group over the other, we can use the base rates directly.

The probability \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) \) (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description) can be calculated by the following formula:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason})} \]

However, since Jasonâ€™s description is a random selection with no discriminating features between the fields, \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) are considered equally likely. Simplifying the Bayesian formula in this context:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]
