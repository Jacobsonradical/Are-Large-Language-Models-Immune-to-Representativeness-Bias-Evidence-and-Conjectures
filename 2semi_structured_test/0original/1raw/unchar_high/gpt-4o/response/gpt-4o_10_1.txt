Sure! To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. We'll start with the basic probabilities provided by the sample:

- The total number of professors is 100.
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Given no other specific information about Jason distinguishing him uniquely as a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we assume that any professor could fit this description equally likely. Therefore, it's appropriate to use the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
