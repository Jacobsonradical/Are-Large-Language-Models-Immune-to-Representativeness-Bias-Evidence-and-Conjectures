To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

Using the information provided:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description is chosen at random, it should not favor one group over the other, assuming the description applies equally well to both groups:
\[ P(\text{description
