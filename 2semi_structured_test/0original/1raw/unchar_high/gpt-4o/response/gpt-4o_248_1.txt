To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem in a somewhat informal way, leveraging the given proportions and general expectations.

First, let's recall the numbers:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100. So, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Without additional specific characteristics that would differentiate Jason as more likely belonging to one group over the other, we can use these base rates to estimate the probability. Since the description provided does not seem to favor one field over the other, we heavily rely on the priors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately the same as the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
