To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. 

From the problem, we know the sample consists of:
- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in the humanities

The total number of professors is 100.

The probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor (P(CS)) is given by the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
