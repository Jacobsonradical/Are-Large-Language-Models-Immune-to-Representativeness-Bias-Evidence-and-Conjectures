To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- The probability of picking a computer science professor from the sample \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} \) or 0.75.
- The probability of picking a humanities professor from the sample \( P(Hum) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} \) or 0.25.

Given that the description does not provide specific information that differentiates between the two groups, we assume the description is likely to be equally representative of professors in both fields.

Thus, our posterior probability \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \) can be estimated as:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Since the description is not providing additional distinctive information, \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid Hum) \) are considered equal. Therefore, we can simplify this to the prior probabilities:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) \approx P(CS)
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains:

\[
P(CS) = 0.75
