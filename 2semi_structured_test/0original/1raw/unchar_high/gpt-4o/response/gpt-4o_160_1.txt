Given that the study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities for a randomly chosen professor being from each group can be calculated. 

- The probability of a professor being from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability of a professor being from humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Without any additional information to differentiate between the personality traits of computer science professors and humanities professors in this specific description, we should use the base rate probabilities.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
