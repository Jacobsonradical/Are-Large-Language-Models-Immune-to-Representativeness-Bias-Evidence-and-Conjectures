Given the nature of the problem, we need to use the information about the sample sizes to determine the probability. We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

The total number of professors is 100. 

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75

And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

We don't have additional details in the description about traits that specifically differentiate between the two groups, so we assume the likelihood of meeting someone fitting Jason's description is equally likely in both groups.

If we assume the description fits professors in both groups equally, then the likelihood ratio is 1.

Thus, by Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is the same as the prior probability:

P(CS|Description) = P(CS) = 0.75

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.75"}
