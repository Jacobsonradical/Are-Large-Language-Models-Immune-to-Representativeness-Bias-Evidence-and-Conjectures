To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's gather the essential data:

1. The total number of professors interviewed:
   - Computer Science: 75
   - Humanities: 25
   Total: 100

2. The proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
   - Computer Science: 75/100 = 0.75

3. Since the descriptions do not provide any distinctive information specific to either field, we assume that the probability of such a description among computer science and humanities professors is equally likely. Therefore, we only consider the base rates.

Given this information, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is found using the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

Thus, the probability is 0.75.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
