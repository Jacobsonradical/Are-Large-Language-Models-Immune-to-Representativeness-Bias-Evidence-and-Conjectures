To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should use the principle of Bayesian inference. We need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample and the fact that the description could apply to both groups.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Assuming the description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) is equally likely to apply to professors in both fields, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is proportional to the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
