{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, again aligning with computer science.

While it's possible for someone in the humanities to possess these traits, they are far more common in computer science. Given the study's sample sizes (75 computer science vs. 25 humanities), the odds significantly favor Jason being a computer science professor.
