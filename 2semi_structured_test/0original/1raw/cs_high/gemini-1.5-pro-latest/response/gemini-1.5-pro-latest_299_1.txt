{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Personality:**  The description highlights "conservative" and "careful," traits often linked to methodical and detail-oriented fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further points away from humanities disciplines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The study has a larger sample size of computer science professors (75) compared to humanities professors (25).
* **Stereotypes:**  It's crucial to acknowledge that these are generalizations and not all computer scientists fit this profile, nor do all humanities professors lack these traits.

**Overall:** While there's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests, the provided information makes it significantly more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
