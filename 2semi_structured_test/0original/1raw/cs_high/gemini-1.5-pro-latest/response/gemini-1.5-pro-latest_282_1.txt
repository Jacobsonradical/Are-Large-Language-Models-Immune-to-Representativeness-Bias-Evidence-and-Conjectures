{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more prevalent in a field emphasizing logic and precision.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:**  This contrasts with typical interests of humanities professors, who often work heavily with language and creative expression. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping individuals based on perceived field inclinations.
