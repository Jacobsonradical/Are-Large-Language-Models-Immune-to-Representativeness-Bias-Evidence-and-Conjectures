{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not explicitly stated, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits might be associated with the meticulous nature of programming. 
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests a form of creativity expressed through logical systems, aligning with computer science. 

It's important to acknowledge that this is based on stereotypes and there can be highly creative individuals in humanities who enjoy logic puzzles and dislike drawing. However, based purely on the provided description and common stereotypes, the probability leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor.
