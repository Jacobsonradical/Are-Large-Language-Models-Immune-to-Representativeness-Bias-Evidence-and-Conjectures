{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in successful individuals across disciplines, so they are not exclusive to either field.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in both fields, but perhaps slightly more common in computer science where precision and structured thinking are highly valued.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less central to the field compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to fit this description as well. The higher probability assigned to computer science is based on the provided characteristics and general stereotypes, which are not always accurate.
