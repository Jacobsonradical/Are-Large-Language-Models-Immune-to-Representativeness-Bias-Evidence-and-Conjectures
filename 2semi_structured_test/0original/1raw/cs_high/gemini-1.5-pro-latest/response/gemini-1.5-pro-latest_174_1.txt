{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests aligned with computer science.
* **Creative but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description fits a common image of a computer science professional, there are many creative and humanities-oriented individuals in computer science, just as there are technically-minded individuals in the humanities.  The probability of 0.9 reflects a strong likelihood, not a certainty.
