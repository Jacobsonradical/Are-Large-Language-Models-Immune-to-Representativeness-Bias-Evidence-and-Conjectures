{"probability": "0.85"} 

My reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** The study started with 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 75% (0.75) prior probability that any professor described is from computer science.
* **Description Analysis:** The description highlights several traits that align more strongly with a computer science stereotype:
    * **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science.
    * **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, this combination is less likely.
* **Caveats:**  It's important to acknowledge:
    * **Stereotypes:** My answer relies on stereotypes about computer science and humanities, which are not always accurate.  
    * **Limited Information:** The description is brief. More details about Jason's research, teaching style, or interests could significantly impact the probability.

**Overall:** While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor. The 0.85 probability reflects the higher prior probability and the supporting evidence from the description.
