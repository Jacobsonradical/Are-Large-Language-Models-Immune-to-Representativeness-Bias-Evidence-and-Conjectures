{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily implies Jason is a computer science professor due to these points:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science.
* **Highly Creative, but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:**  This contrasts with typical humanities interests, further suggesting a technical field.

It's important to acknowledge that this is probabilistic, not certain.  Some humanities professors might have technical hobbies, and personality isn't a perfect predictor.  However, based on the available information, a high probability (0.9) is warranted.
