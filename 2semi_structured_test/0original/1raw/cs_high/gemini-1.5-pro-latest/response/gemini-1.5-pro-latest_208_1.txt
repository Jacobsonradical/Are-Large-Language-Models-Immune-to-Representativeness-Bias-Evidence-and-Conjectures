{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** This suggests a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits, again aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is based on stereotypes and limited information. Many computer scientists are artistic, and many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles. This answer reflects a probability based on common perceptions, not a guaranteed prediction.
