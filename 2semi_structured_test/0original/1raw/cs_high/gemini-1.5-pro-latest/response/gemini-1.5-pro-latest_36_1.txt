{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators favoring computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are highly suggestive of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:**  These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be seen as aligning with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly pointing away from humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. The higher base rate of computer science professors (75% of the sample) heavily influences the probability.
