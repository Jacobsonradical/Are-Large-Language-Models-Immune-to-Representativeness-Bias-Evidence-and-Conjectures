{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards characteristics often associated with individuals in STEM fields, particularly computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core interests and skills within computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits are not exclusive to any field, they are often associated with the detail-oriented and methodical nature of programming. 
* **Ambitious:**  Ambition is generally associated with career success, making it less informative for this specific distinction.
* **Dislike of drawing and writing:** While not universal, this could suggest a preference for logic and problem-solving over artistic expression.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are artistic, and many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles. This answer is based on probabilistic reasoning given the limited information and common associations, not on absolute assumptions.
