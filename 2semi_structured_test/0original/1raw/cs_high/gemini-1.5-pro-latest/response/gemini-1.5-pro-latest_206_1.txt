{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While this is not a foolproof assessment, certain aspects of the description lean towards a computer science profile:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits might be associated with the detail-oriented and logical thinking often found in the field.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** This contrasts with typical humanities interests and further supports a computer science leaning. 

The larger sample size of computer science professors (75 vs. 25) also increases the prior probability that Jason belongs to that group. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes. Many successful humanities professors could also fit this description, and personality traits alone are not definitive indicators of profession.
