{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it significantly more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  A strong affinity for math aligns more with the typical computer science background.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 

The description lacks any strong indicators of a humanities background. While Jason is creative, his disinterest in drawing or writing makes it less likely he's in a field where those are central. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. The high probability assigned reflects the strength of the provided clues, not absolute certainty.
