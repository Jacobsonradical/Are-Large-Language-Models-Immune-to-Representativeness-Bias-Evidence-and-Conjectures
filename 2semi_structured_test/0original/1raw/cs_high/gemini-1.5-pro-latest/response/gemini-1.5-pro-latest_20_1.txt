{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful academics in any field, but particularly in the competitive field of computer science. 

The lack of interest in drawing or writing might be seen as slightly contradicting a humanities profile, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors might enjoy coding, and many computer science professors might be talented artists. This response is based on probabilities derived from the given information, not assumptions about entire fields.
