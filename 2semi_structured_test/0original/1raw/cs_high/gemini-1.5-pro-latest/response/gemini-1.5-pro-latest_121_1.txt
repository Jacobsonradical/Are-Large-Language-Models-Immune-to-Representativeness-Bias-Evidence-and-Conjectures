{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligned with computer science.
* **"Talented" and "ambitious":** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but the fact that they are highlighted alongside his technical interests may suggest they manifest in a technical field. 

It's important to acknowledge that this is still a probability, not a certainty.  Here's why:

* **Humanities professors can be technically inclined:** Some areas of the humanities, like digital humanities or computational linguistics, involve coding and mathematical thinking. 
* **The description lacks strong indicators of humanities interests:**  We don't see mentions of literature, history, philosophy, etc. However, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.

**Given the information provided, a probability of 0.9 (or 90%) seems reasonable. This reflects a high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, while still acknowledging the possibility that he could be in the humanities.**
