{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence of Jason's profession, the clues heavily suggest a computer science background:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for analytical and logical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science than humanities.

Considering the base rates (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities professors), and the strong clues within the description, it is significantly more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. 

It's important to note that this is still a probability, not a certainty. There is a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
