{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** Explicitly mentioned interest in coding is a strong indicator of being in computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:** Enjoying mathematical puzzles aligns well with the problem-solving nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for someone in humanities, the lack of interest in these areas, especially when coupled with the strong technical inclinations, further tips the scales towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong interest in the computational aspects of his field.
