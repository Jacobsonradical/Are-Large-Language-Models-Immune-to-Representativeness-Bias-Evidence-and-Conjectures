{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several factors strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a highly specific skill directly relevant to computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  A strong affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns well with computer science. 
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:**  While not impossible for a humanities professor, this further leans away from fields where those skills are often central.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This prior probability heavily influences our estimate.
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this relies on stereotypes. There are certainly creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy coding, and computer science professors who love art. 

**The probability of 0.9 reflects a high likelihood, but not certainty, based on the provided information and acknowledging the limitations of such deductions.**
