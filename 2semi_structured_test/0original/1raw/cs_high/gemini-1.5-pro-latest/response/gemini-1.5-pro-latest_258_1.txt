{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Personality:** The description highlights "ambitious" and "talented," traits often associated with success in highly competitive fields like computer science.  
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a preference for logical and analytical pursuits over artistic ones, aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with a strong interest in computational linguistics or digital humanities. However, based on the provided profile, the probability leans heavily towards computer science.
