{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues point towards Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but are particularly relevant in the competitive world of computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could apply to both fields, but might be slightly more associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 

The fact that Jason enjoys jogging and dislikes drawing or writing doesn't offer strong evidence in either direction.

**Important Note:** This assessment relies on stereotypes and probabilities. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are conservative and detail-oriented humanities professors.  Without more information, a high probability based on these limited descriptors is the best we can offer.
