{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science.
* **"Talented" and "Ambitious":** These traits, while applicable to both fields, are often associated with success in the technically demanding field of computer science. 
* **Lack of Enjoyment for Drawing and Writing:** While not impossible for someone in the humanities, these activities are less central to the field than they might be in certain humanities disciplines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The study has a larger sample size of computer science professors (75 vs 25), making it statistically more likely that Jason belongs to that group.
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is based on probabilistic reasoning and stereotypes. There are undoubtedly humanities professors who enjoy coding and mathematicians who love writing.

**Overall:** While not definitive, the available information points to a significantly higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
