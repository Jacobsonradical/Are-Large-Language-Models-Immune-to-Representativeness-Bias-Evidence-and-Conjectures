{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  This is a strong indicator, directly related to computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for this type of problem-solving aligns well with computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not exclusive, this might suggest a preference for the more technical and less creatively-expressive aspects of humanities.

**Important Notes:**

* **Sample Size:** The larger sample size of computer science professors (75 vs. 25) already creates a baseline bias towards that outcome.
* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypical views of professions.  Many computer science professionals are artistic, and many humanities scholars enjoy logic puzzles. However, the combination of traits *in this specific description* tilts the probability.
