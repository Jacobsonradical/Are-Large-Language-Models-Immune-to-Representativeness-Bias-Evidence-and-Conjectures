{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several strong indicators point to Jason likely being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a core skill in computer science and unusual for a humanities professor.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  Enjoying mathematical puzzles strongly aligns with the logical and analytical thinking common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, are often associated with the field's emphasis on precision and structured problem-solving.

The lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing, while suggesting he might not be in a humanities field that emphasizes those skills, isn't as strong an indicator as the positive correlations mentioned above. 

**Important Note:** This is still just a probability. The information provided does not guarantee Jason's profession. There are creative and ambitious computer scientists who might not enjoy those activities, and there could be humanities professors with unexpected interests in coding and mathematics.
