{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** While these traits can be found in both fields, they align slightly more with the stereotypical image of a computer scientist, often associated with meticulousness and logical thinking.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and less artistic pursuits, again aligning more with the general perception of computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are many creative and artistic computer scientists, and many humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.  A more definitive answer would require analyzing the specific personality tests and comparing Jason's profile to the average profiles of both groups.
