{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in the stereotype of a computer science professor.
* **Lack of Enjoyment for Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for more logic and structure-based activities, again aligning more with computer science than humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer based on limited information and potential stereotypes.  There are plenty of humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or dislike drawing, just as there are computer science professors who are highly creative in artistic ways.
