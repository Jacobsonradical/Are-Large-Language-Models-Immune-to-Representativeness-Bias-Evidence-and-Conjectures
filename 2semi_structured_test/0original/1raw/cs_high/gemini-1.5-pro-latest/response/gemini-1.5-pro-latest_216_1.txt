{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science and extremely unlikely to be a hobby for a humanities professor.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for this type of problem-solving aligns more with a computer science mindset.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, a disinterest in these creative outlets further points away from that field. 

**Important Note:** My reasoning relies on probabilities and stereotypes. It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to enjoy coding and math puzzles, or for a computer science professor to be an artist or writer. This response aims to provide the most likely scenario based on the limited information.
