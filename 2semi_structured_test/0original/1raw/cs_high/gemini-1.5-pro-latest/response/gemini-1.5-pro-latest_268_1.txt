{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily implies Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM slant:** Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset, common in computer science. 
* **Lack of artistic inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests his creativity might be channeled into fields like programming, which is often considered a creative endeavor within computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.  However, the provided description makes it significantly more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
