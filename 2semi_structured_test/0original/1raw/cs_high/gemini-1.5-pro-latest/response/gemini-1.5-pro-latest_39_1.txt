{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia.
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits could be applicable to either field, but might be slightly more associated with the structured nature of computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for technical fields over humanities, though not definitively.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many individuals in the humanities are also skilled in logic and may enjoy puzzles. Similarly, many computer scientists are creative and expressive through various mediums.  The provided probability is based on a likelihood derived from common associations, not absolute certainty.
