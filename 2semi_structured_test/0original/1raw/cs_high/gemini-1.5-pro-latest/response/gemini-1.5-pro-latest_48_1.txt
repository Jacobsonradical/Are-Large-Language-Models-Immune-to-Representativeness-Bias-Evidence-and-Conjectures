{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues point towards Jason being more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might be more common in fields emphasizing logic and precision. 
* **Lack of Enjoyment for Drawing and Writing:** This suggests less inclination towards traditionally artistic or literary pursuits, which are more common within humanities.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists are artistic. This answer is based on probability given the limited information and common trends, not absolute assumptions.
