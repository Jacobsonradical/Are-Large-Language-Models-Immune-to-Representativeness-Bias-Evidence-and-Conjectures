{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with skills and interests commonly associated with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in both fields, but ambition might be particularly relevant in the competitive field of computer science. 
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, this suggests less inclination towards activities often associated with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is based on probabilistic reasoning from a limited description. There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor. The information provided simply makes it more likely than him being a humanities professor.
