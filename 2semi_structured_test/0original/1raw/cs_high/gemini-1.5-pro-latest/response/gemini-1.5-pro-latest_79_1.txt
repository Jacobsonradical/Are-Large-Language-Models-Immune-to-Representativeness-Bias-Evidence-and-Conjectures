{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more associated with the structured nature of computer science compared to some humanities disciplines. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  There are undoubtedly creative and artistic computer scientists, as well as meticulous and logic-driven individuals in the humanities. However, based on the provided information and common trends, a probability leaning towards computer science is more likely.
