{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a talent for creativity within a field that often shuns artistic pursuits (drawing, writing) strongly align with a computer science persona. 
* **Lack of counter-indicators:** There's nothing in the description suggesting humanities. While humanities professors can be ambitious, conservative, etc., these traits are not as strongly associated with the field as they might be with computer science. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are deeply analytical and detail-oriented humanities professors. However, based on the provided information and common trends, a higher probability leans towards Jason being in computer science.
