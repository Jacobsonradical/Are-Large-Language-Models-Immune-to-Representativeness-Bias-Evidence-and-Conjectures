{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data on personality type distribution between the two fields, the description leans heavily towards stereotypes associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be perceived as more common in structured fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not a definitive marker, it further distances Jason from humanities stereotypes.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotype Bias:** My reasoning relies on common stereotypes. It's crucial to remember that these are generalizations and individual personalities within any field can vary greatly. 
* **Limited Information:** The description provides a very limited snapshot of Jason's personality. Other factors, like his research interests or teaching style, could offer more definitive clues.

**Therefore, while my assigned probability is high, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty and potential bias within this assessment.**
