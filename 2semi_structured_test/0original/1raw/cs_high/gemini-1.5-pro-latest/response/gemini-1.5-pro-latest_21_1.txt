{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across successful individuals in many fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in either field and don't strongly suggest one over the other.
* **Married with five children:** This is biographical information and doesn't correlate strongly with either profession.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for more technical fields, but it's not conclusive.

**The most significant factors pointing towards computer science are his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles.**

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are successful humanities professors who enjoy coding, and many computer science professors who are artistic.
