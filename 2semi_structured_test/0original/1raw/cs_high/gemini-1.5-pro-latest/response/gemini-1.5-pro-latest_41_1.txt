{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Personality:** "Conservative" and "careful" could be seen as fitting stereotypes of both fields, but when combined with the strong interest indicators, they further support the computer science likelihood.
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing"  might suggest a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:** This is still a probabilistic judgment. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unique interests. However, based on the provided information, a high probability towards computer science seems warranted.
