**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it highlights several traits more commonly associated with computer science professors:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, aligning with computer science. 

The description leans heavily towards interests and skills favored in computer science. While it's possible Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests, it's statistically more probable he belongs to the larger (75%) computer science group in the study.
