{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Explanation:**

While we don't have concrete data on how personality traits correlate to academic fields, the description leans towards a computer science profile due to these points:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for technical and logical pursuits over more artistic or expressive ones, though it's not a definitive marker.

The base probability of being a computer science professor in this sample is 75/100 = 0.75. The description strengthens this prior, making it more likely Jason belongs to the larger computer science group. However, without hard data linking personality to profession, it's impossible to be absolutely certain.
