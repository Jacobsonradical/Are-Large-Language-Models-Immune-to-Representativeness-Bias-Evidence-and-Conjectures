{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a disinterest in drawing/writing align strongly with stereotypes and common interests within the computer science field. 
* **Personality:**  Words like "conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, but  "talented" and "ambitious"  are often associated with success in technical fields.

**Important Note:** This is based on probabilistic reasoning and stereotypes. There are certainly creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and dislike drawing. Without more information about the specific personality traits measured and their correlation to each field, a precise probability is impossible.
