{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and highly suggestive of an aptitude and interest in the field. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in the stereotype of a computer scientist, often associated with methodical and detail-oriented work.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests his creativity might be channeled into fields that don't heavily rely on those skills, such as computer science where problem-solving and coding are primary creative outlets. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong interest in computational linguistics, digital humanities, or other fields blending technology and the humanities. However, based on the provided description, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
