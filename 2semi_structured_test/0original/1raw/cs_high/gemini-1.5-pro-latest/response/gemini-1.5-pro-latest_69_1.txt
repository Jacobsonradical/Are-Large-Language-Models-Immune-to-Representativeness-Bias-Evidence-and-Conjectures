{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core interests and skills within computer science.
* **"Talented" and "Ambitious":** These traits, while applicable to both fields, are often associated with success in the competitive, results-oriented world of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for more technical, less creatively-expressive fields, again aligning with computer science.

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (1.0). There's always a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the provided information, it's statistically more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
