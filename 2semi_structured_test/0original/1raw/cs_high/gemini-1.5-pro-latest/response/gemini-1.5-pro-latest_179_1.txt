{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in any field, but they are particularly relevant in the competitive world of computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators of a humanities background. While Jason could still be in the humanities, the provided information makes it significantly more likely that he's a computer science professor. 

**Note:** My probability estimate is based on a subjective interpretation of the description and general knowledge about the fields. A more precise statistical analysis would require access to the full dataset and the specific personality traits being measured.
