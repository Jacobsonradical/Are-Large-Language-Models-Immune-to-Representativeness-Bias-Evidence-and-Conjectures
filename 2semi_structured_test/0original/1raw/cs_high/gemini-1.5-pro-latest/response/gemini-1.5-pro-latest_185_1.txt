{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests aligned with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing structured thinking and precision.
* **Lack of Enjoyment for Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for activities less central to many humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual interests. The probability is high, but not absolute.
