{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented:** While applicable to both fields, "talented" combined with his enjoyment of coding suggests a skillset often found in computer science.
* **Ambitious:**  Ambition is common in academia overall, but perhaps slightly more stereotypical of those in fields like computer science which can be quite competitive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This significantly influences the prior probability.
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:** The description lacks any strong indicators of interests typically associated with the humanities (e.g., literature, history, philosophy). 

**Disclaimer:** It's crucial to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes. There are many successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or even coding. This analysis simply highlights the increased *probability* based on the provided data.
