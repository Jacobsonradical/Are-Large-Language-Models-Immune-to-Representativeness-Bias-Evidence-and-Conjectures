{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core interests directly related to computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be associated with the detail-oriented and logical thinking often found in programming and computer science research.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

While it's possible for a humanities professor to have these traits, the combination strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:**  This probability is an educated guess based on stereotypes. There is no guarantee that Jason is a computer science professor, as humanities professors can also possess these interests and personality traits.
