{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be suggestive of a structured and detail-oriented approach often associated with programming and computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might seem to point away from humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.  We don't have enough information to be 100% certain.
