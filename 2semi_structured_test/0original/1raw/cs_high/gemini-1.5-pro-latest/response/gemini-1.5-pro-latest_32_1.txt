{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, common traits in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits align with the meticulous and detail-oriented nature of programming. 

The description does mention Jason being highly creative, but his dislike for drawing and writing might suggest his creativity manifests in more technical or problem-solving avenues.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a passion for logic puzzles and coding as hobbies.  Without more data points about typical personality traits found in the study, it's impossible to be completely certain.
