{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science. 

The description provides no strong indicators towards humanities.  While Jason's personal life (married with children) and some traits (conservative, careful, ambitious) could apply to either field, the highlighted interests make a computer science background significantly more likely.
