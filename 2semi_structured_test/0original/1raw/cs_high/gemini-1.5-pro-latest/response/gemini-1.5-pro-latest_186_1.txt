{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** Explicitly mentioning "coding" strongly suggests familiarity and likely engagement with computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:** A preference for mathematical puzzles aligns well with the logical and analytical thinking often associated with computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not definitive, this suggests a possible preference for technical pursuits over more artistic or expressive ones, which are often linked to humanities. 

**Important Note:**  This is a probability, not a certainty. It's possible Jason is a humanities professor with unusual hobbies or someone who transitioned from a technical background. However, based on the provided information, a higher probability leans towards computer science.
