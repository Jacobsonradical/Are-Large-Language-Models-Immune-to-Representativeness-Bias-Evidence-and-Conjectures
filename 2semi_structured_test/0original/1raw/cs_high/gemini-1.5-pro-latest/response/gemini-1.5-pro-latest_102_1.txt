{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it highlights several traits that align more strongly with a computer science stereotype:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits can be associated with the meticulous and detail-oriented nature of programming.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These are general traits of successful individuals in many fields, so they don't strongly point to one profession over the other.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for technical fields over humanities.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this is a probability based on stereotypes. Many computer science professors might not fit this description, and many humanities professors might. The information provided doesn't guarantee Jason's profession.
