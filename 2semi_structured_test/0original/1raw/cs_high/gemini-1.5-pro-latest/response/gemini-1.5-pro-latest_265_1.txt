{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, common traits in computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests creativity expressed in ways other than traditional arts, aligning more with the problem-solving nature of computer science. 

The description offers no clues suggesting humanities. While humanities professors can be analytical and logical, the specific combination of traits leans heavily towards a computer science profile. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's not a certainty, and other factors could exist.
