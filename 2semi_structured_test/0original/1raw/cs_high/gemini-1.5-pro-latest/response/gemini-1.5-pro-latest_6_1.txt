{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science and far less common in most humanities disciplines.
* **"Talented" and "Ambitious":** While applicable to both fields, these traits align with the stereotype of successful figures in the tech-driven world of computer science.
* **Dislike of Drawing and Writing:** This suggests a preference for logical and technical pursuits over artistic or expressive ones, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There are certainly creative computer scientists who enjoy artistic hobbies and humanities professors who appreciate logic puzzles. However, based on the provided profile and common stereotypes, a higher probability lies with Jason being a computer science professor.
