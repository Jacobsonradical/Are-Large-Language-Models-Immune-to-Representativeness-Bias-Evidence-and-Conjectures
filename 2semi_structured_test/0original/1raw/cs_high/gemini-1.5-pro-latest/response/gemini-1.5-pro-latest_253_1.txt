{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science and strongly suggest an inclination towards the field.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less central to their work compared to computer science. 

**Important Note:** The probability is high but not absolute (1.0). There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical hobbies or someone in a subfield like digital humanities where coding is relevant.
