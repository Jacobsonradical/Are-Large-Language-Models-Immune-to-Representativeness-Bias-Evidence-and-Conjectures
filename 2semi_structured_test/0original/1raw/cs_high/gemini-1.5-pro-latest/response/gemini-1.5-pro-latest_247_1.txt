{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While this is not a foolproof assessment, several factors point to a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be more commonly associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and less artistic fields. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are many creative and artistic computer scientists, and many humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This analysis simply leans on common perceptions to provide a probability estimate.
