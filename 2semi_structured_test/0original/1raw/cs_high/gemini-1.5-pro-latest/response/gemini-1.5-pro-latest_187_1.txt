{"probability": "0.9"} 

I assign a high probability to Jason being a computer science professor due to the strong alignment of his profile with stereotypes associated with that profession. Here's why:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are highly indicative of interests common in computer science.
* **Personality:** While not exclusive to computer science, traits like "conservative" and "careful" align with stereotypes of the field. 
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a leaning towards technical creativity over artistic expression. 

**Important Note:** My answer is based on probabilistic reasoning and stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid using this type of thinking to make assumptions about individuals in real-life situations.
