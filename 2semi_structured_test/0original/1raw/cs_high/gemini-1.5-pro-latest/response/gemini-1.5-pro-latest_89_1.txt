{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again common in computer science.

While a humanities professor *could* have these traits, they are more typical of someone in a quantitative field like computer science.  

Given the study's sample size (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities professors), the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being in computer science is already 0.75. The provided description strengthens this likelihood.  Therefore, a probability of 0.9 seems reasonable.
