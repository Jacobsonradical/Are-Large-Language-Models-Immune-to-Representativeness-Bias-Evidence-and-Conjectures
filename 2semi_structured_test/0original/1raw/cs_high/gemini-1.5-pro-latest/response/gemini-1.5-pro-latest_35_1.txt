{"probability": "0.75"}

**Reasoning:**

We need to apply Bayesian reasoning here, considering the base rates and the evidence provided.

* **Base Rate:** There's a higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75 out of 100) compared to humanities professors (25 out of 100). This means there's a 75% chance a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

* **Evidence:** The description aligns more with stereotypes about computer science professors:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles. 
    * Highly creative but dislikes drawing and writing (potentially indicating a preference for logical/analytical creativity over artistic creativity).

While this evidence isn't definitive, it increases the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.  

**Important Note:** This probability is based on limited information and stereotypes. We cannot definitively say which department Jason belongs to without further information.
