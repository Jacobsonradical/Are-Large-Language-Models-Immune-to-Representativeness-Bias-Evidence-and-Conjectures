{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science. 
* **"Talented" and "Ambitious":** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with success in the competitive, results-driven world of computer science.
* **Dislike of Drawing and Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are more central to humanities disciplines. 

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., "1.0"). There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and coding as hobbies. However, the overall profile aligns more strongly with a computer science background.
