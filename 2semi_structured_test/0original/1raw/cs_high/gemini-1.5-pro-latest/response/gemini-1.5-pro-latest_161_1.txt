{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Personality:** The description mentions he's "talented" and "ambitious," traits often found in successful academics, but the lack of enjoyment for "drawing or writing" suggests a potential preference for technical fields over humanities.

**Important Note:** This is still a probabilistic judgment. There could be computer science professors who enjoy drawing and writing, and humanities professors who enjoy coding. However, based on the provided information, the probability leans heavily towards Jason being in the computer science group.
