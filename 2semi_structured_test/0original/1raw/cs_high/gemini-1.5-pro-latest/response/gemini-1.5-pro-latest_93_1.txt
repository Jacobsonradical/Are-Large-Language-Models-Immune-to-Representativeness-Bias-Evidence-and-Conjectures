{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several factors strongly suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Highly Creative, but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:** This suggests creativity channeled into technical fields rather than artistic ones.
* **Ambitious:** While present in both fields, ambition might be more readily associated with the competitive, results-driven nature of computer science (especially within the context of the study focusing on "successful" academics).

**Important Note:** This is still a probabilistic judgment. The information doesn't rule out Jason being a humanities professor with unusual interests. There could be humanities fields where his skills are valuable (e.g., digital humanities, computational linguistics). However, based on common stereotypes and the information given, a higher probability leans towards computer science.
