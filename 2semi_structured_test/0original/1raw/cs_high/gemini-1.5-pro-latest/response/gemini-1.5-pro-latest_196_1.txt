{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several cues strongly suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core skills and interests within computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while general, might align with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science work.
* **Lack of enjoyment in drawing/writing:**  This contrasts with common skills and interests often associated with humanities professors.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, just as there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This answer is based on probabilities within the provided context, not absolute assumptions.
