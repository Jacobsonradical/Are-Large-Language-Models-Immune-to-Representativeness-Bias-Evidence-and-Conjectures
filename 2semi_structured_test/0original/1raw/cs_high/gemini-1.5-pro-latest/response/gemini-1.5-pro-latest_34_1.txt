{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A strong affinity for logic and problem-solving is common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they might align more with the structured nature of computer science compared to some humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are creative and artistic computer scientists, just as there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This response is based on probabilities derived from common trends within the described fields, not on absolute assumptions.
