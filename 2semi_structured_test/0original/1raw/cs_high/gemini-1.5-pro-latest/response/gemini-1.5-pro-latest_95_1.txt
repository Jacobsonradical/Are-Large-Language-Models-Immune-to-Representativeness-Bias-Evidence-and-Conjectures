{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Lack of Enjoyment in Drawing and Writing:** While some humanities professors might not enjoy these either, they are less central to the field compared to computer science.

**Important Note:**  My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty.  It's possible for a humanities professor to have Jason's traits.  More information about his research, teaching style, or specific interests would increase the prediction accuracy.
