{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset common in the field.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are less central to the field compared to humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The study has a significantly larger sample size of computer science professors (75 vs. 25). This inherently increases the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypes. This answer is based on probabilistic reasoning from the provided information, not on assumptions about what computer science professors "should" be like. 

**Final Note:** The probability of 0.9 is a subjective assessment based on the given information.  Other individuals might arrive at slightly different probabilities.
