{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be associated with the detail-oriented nature of programming. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing and writing:** This suggests a preference for creative problem-solving within a structured framework, which aligns with computer science. 

It's important to remember that this is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. However, based on the provided profile and the base rates in the study (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities), it's more likely that Jason belongs to the computer science group.
