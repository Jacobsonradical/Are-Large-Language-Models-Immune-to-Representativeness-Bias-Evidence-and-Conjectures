**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it highlights several traits that are stereotypically associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Conservative:** This trait might be slightly more associated with computer science than humanities, though it's not a strong indicator.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are generally associated with success in many fields, including both computer science and humanities. 
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for logical and technical pursuits over more artistic ones, aligning more with the stereotype of computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are many successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and dislike drawing, just as there are computer scientists who are artistic. However, given the provided information and common stereotypes, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
