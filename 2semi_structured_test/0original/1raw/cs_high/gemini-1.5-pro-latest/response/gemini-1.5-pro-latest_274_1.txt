{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing logic and precision.

The description does mention Jason being highly creative, which might seem to counter the "conservative" aspect. However, creativity is essential in both computer science and the humanities, manifesting differently. 

Importantly, the sample size of computer science professors (75) is three times larger than humanities professors (25). This significantly influences the probability. 

**It's crucial to remember this is not a certain conclusion.** Jason could very well be a humanities professor with a passion for logic puzzles and coding as hobbies. However, based on the available information and the sample sizes, it's more probable that he belongs to the computer science group.
