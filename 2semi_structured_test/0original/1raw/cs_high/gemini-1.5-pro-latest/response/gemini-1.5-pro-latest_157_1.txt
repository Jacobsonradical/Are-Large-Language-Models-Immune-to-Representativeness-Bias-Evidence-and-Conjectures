{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science. 
* **Creative but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember this is a probability, not a certainty. The information provided paints a likely picture but doesn't entirely rule out Jason being a humanities professor with atypical interests.
