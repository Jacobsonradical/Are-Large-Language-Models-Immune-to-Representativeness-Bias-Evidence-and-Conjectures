{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several cues point towards a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Personality:** While "conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, "ambitious" is often associated with competitive fields like computer science.
* **Lack of artistic inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing"  suggests his creativity might be channeled into more technical or logical pursuits.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
