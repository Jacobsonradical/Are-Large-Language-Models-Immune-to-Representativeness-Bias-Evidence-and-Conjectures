{"probability": "0.9"} 

Here's why I lean heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotypes:**  The description emphasizes traits often associated with computer scientists:
    * **Logical/Analytical:** "solving mathematical puzzles" 
    * **Technical:** "enjoys coding"
    * **Detail-Oriented:** "careful" 
* **Less Alignment with Humanities Stereotypes:** While some traits are applicable to both fields, the description lacks strong indicators of typical humanities interests:
    * **Expressive Writing:**  "does not enjoy... writing" 
    * **Visual Arts:** "does not enjoy... drawing"

**Important Note:** This is based on probabilistic reasoning and common stereotypes. There are always exceptions, and many humanities professors could fit Jason's description.
