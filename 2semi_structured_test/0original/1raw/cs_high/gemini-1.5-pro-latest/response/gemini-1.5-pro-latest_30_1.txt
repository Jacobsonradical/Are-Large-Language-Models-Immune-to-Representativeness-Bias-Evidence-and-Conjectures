{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities closely aligned with computer science.
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:**  While not impossible for someone in the humanities, these activities are less central to the field than to some others. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a probabilistic judgment, not a certainty. There are certainly humanities professors who enjoy coding or dislike drawing.
* The relatively small sample size of the study and the lack of information about the specific personality tests used make it difficult to be more precise.
