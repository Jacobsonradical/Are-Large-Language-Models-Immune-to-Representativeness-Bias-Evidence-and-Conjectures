{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several factors point to a high probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of interest in drawing and writing:** While some computer scientists may enjoy these activities, they are generally less central to the field than to humanities.

**Important Note:** This is still just a probability. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unusual interests. The description doesn't provide enough information for absolute certainty.
