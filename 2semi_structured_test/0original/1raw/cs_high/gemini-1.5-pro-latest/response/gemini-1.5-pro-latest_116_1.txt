{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science. 
* **Mathematical Puzzles:** A preference for this aligns strongly with the analytical thinking common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly pushing away from humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This response is based on probabilities derived from common trends and the specific information provided.
