{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While this is not a perfect prediction, several clues point to a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Personality:**  "Conservative" and "careful" could be seen as fitting stereotypes of both fields, but when combined with his enjoyment of logic-based activities, it leans towards computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest:**  Not enjoying "drawing or writing" suggests less inclination towards humanities fields that often value these skills.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid over-relying on stereotypes. While the description fits some general perceptions of computer science professors, many individuals in both fields may not fit these molds.
* **Small Sample Size:**  The study only included 100 professors, which is a relatively small sample size. 

**Therefore, while a probability of 0.85 seems reasonable, it's essential to acknowledge the limitations of this prediction.**
