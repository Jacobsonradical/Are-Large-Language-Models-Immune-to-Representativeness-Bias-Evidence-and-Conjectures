{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits are less stereotypical of either field but don't strongly point in one direction or the other.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for more logic-based activities over artistic expression, which is more common in computer science.

**Important Note:** This assessment is based on stereotypes and common associations. There are undoubtedly creative and successful individuals in both computer science and the humanities who defy these generalizations.  A single description is not enough for a definitive classification.
