{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it hints at a personality more commonly associated with computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any profession, might be seen as aligning with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical pursuits over artistic or expressive ones.

**Important Note:**  This probability is based on stereotypes and limited information.  Many successful humanities professors could also fit this description. The absence of information about Jason's teaching, research, or specific academic interests makes it impossible to give a definitive answer.
