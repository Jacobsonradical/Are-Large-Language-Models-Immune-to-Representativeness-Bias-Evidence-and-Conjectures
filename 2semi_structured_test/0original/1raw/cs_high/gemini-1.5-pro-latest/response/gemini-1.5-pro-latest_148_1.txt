{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Not Enjoying Drawing or Writing:**  While not impossible for a humanities professor, this leans away from typical interests in fields like literature, history, or art.

**Important Note:**  My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty. There's always a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical hobbies.
