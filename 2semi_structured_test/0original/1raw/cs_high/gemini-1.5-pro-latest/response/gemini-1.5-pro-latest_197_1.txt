My reasoning:

While there's no information explicitly stating someone can't be a humanities professor with these traits, several strongly suggest a computer science background:

* **Enjoys coding:** A core activity in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  A common trait aligned with computational thinking. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  Creativity manifests in many ways; this suggests a technical rather than artistic inclination.

While a humanities professor *could* have these interests, they are far more typical of someone in computer science.
