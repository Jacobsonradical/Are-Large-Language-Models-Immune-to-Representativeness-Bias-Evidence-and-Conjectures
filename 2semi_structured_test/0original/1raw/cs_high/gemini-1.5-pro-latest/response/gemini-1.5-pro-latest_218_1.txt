{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data to calculate an exact probability, we can make an informed estimate based on the information provided:

* **Strong Stereotype:** The description aligns strongly with common stereotypes of computer science professionals (enjoying coding, math puzzles, less interest in artistic pursuits). 
* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means a randomly selected professor is inherently three times more likely to be from computer science.

Considering both the stereotype reinforcement and the base rate, it's highly likely that Jason is a computer science professor.  My probability estimate of 0.9 reflects this. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that stereotypes are oversimplifications and not always accurate. This answer relies heavily on the provided description aligning with those stereotypes.
