{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** Directly relevant to computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:**  While not exclusive to any field, these traits can align with the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming. 
* **Lack of interest in drawing and writing:**  This might suggest a preference for technical over artistic expression, further pointing towards computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  There are plenty of creative and artistic individuals in computer science, and many in the humanities who enjoy logic puzzles. However, given the limited information and the probability task, the provided description tilts the scales significantly towards Jason being a computer science professor.
