{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with a computer science background and passion.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, again pointing towards computer science.

The description provides no strong indicators for a humanities background. While some aspects (being married with children, conservative) are neutral, the core interests strongly suggest Jason's profession is computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. It's possible Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.
