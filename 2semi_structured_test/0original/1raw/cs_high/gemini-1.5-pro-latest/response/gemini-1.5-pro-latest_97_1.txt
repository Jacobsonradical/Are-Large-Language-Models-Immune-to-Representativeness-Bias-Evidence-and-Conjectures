{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues point to a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** Explicit mention of enjoying "coding" strongly suggests familiarity and likely engagement with computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for "solving mathematical puzzles" aligns well with the logical and analytical thinking common in computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not all computer scientists dislike these activities, the contrast between his creativity and disinterest might indicate a preference for more technical forms of expression.

**Important Note:** The description provides no negative indicators against Jason being in the humanities.  However, the positive indicators towards computer science make it a significantly more likely scenario.
