{"probability": "0.9"} 

Here's why I lean heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotype:**  The description emphasizes traits often associated with computer scientists:
    * **Logical/Analytical:** "Solving mathematical puzzles" strongly suggests this.
    * **Technical Skill:** "Enjoys coding" is a clear indicator. 
    * **Less Artistic:** "Does not enjoy drawing or writing" while being "highly creative" implies creativity within a specific, potentially technical, domain.
* **Ambition in Academia:** "Ambitious" combined with his established academic position (tenured, successful) further hints at a field like computer science where ambition can be readily applied and rewarded.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes Aren't Universal:**  While these traits point towards computer science, it's crucial to remember not all computer scientists fit this mold, nor are these traits exclusive to the field.
* **Humanities Professors are Diverse:** Humanities professors can be analytical, creative in non-artistic ways, and ambitious. 
* **Limited Information:** We only have a brief personality sketch, lacking details about Jason's research, teaching style, or specific interests within his field.

**Despite these caveats, the provided information strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor.**
