{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data on the personalities of all computer science vs. humanities professors, the description leans heavily towards stereotypes associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often found in computer science.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While not universal, this might suggest a preference for technical over artistic expression. 

It's important to note:

* **Stereotypes are not foolproof:** There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. 
* **Base rate matters:** The study had 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This significantly influences the probability.

Given the description and the base rates in the study, it's significantly more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it's not a certainty.
