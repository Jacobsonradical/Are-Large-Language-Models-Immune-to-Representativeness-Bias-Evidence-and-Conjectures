{"probability": "0.9"} 

My reasoning:

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with computer science interests.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This contrasts with common humanities activities.

While a humanities professor *could* have these traits, it's far more likely for a computer science professor.  

The fact that 75% of the study participants were computer science professors further increases the probability.
