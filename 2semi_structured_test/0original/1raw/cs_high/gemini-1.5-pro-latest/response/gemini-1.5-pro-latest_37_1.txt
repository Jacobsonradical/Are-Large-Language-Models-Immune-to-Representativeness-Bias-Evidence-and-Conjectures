{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it significantly more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with computer science interests.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common in successful academics across fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in both fields, offering little differentiation.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for more technical fields, but it's not conclusive.

**The key factor is the combination of coding and mathematical puzzle enjoyment, which are highly suggestive of computer science.**  

Given the relatively small sample size and the possibility of outliers, a probability of 1.0 (absolute certainty) is unwarranted. A probability of 0.9 acknowledges the information provided while still allowing for some uncertainty.
