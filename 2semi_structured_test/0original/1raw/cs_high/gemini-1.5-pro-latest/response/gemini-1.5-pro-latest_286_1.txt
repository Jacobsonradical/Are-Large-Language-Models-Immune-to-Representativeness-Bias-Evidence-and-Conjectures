{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be seen as aligning with the detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:** This makes it somewhat less likely that Jason is in the humanities, where these skills are often valued.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors are interested in technology and many computer scientists are artistic. This response is based on probabilities derived from common associations, not absolute truths.
