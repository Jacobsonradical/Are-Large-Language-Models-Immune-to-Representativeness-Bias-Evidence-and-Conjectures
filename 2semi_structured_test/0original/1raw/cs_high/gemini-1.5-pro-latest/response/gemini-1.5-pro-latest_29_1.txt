{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with the skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science.

While it's possible for someone in the humanities to possess these traits, they are more typical of a computer science professor. Given the information provided and the base rates in the study (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities professors), a probability of 0.9 seems reasonable.
