{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:**  Creativity is important in both fields, but this specific combination suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not guarantees:**  While the description aligns with common perceptions of computer scientists, many humanities professors could also fit this profile.
* **Small sample size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample, making broad generalizations less reliable. 

My probability of 0.9 is a high likelihood, but not absolute certainty, based on the provided information.
