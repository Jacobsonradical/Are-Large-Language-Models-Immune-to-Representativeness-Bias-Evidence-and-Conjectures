{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but the specific combination with his other interests leans towards computer science.

The description lacks strong indicators of humanities interests. While he's creative, his disinterest in drawing and writing weakens the association with fields like literature or art history.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic assessment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests, highlighting the limitations of stereotyping based on personality.
