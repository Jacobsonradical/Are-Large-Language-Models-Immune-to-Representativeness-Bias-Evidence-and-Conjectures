{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the information strongly suggests he's more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  "Coding," "solving mathematical puzzles," and enjoying a highly structured activity like jogging all align strongly with common interests and aptitudes found in computer science. 
* **Creative, but not in artistic ways:** The description explicitly mentions creativity while also stating a dislike for drawing and writing. This suggests a more technical or problem-solving-focused type of creativity, again aligning with computer science.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Not a guarantee:** The information is suggestive, not conclusive. There are always exceptions, and some humanities professors might share Jason's interests.
* **Base rate:**  The study had 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This 3:1 ratio means it was already more likely Jason was in computer science even before considering his description.

**Therefore, while not 100% certain, a probability of 0.9 reflects the strong likelihood based on the available information.**
