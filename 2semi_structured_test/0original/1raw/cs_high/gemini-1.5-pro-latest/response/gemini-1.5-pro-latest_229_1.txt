{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotypes:**  The description highlights traits often associated with computer scientists: logical thinking ("solving mathematical puzzles"), technical proficiency ("enjoys coding"), and a preference for structured fields. 
* **Lack of Fit with Humanities Stereotypes:**  The description explicitly mentions Jason's disinterest in drawing and writing, activities often associated with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** Stereotypes are not always accurate. This assessment is based on probability and the information provided, not a guaranteed prediction of Jason's profession.
