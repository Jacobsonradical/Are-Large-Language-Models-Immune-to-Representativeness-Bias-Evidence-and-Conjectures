{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Talented and Ambitious:** These traits are found in both fields, but combined with his other interests, they lean more towards a technical field. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While not definitive, this suggests a preference for technical pursuits over more artistic ones, traditionally associated with humanities.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors might enjoy coding, and many computer scientists are skilled writers and artists. However, based on the provided information and common trends, the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor.
