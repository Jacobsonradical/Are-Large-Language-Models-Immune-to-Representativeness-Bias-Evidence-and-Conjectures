{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligned with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing logic and precision.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are more commonly associated with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors might enjoy coding, and many computer science professors might be talented writers or artists. This response is based on probabilistic reasoning given the limited information and common trends, not on absolute assumptions.
