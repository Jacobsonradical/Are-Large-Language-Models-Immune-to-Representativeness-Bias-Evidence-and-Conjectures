{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:** My probability is high but not absolute (1.0). There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unusual hobbies or a unique blend of interests. However, based on the provided information, computer science is significantly more likely.
