{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a talent for problem-solving strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not universal, a disinterest in these areas further distances Jason from a stereotypical humanities profile.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. However, based on the provided information and the higher baseline probability (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities), it's more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.
