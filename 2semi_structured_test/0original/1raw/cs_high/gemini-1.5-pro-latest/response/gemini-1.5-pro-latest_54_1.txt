{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a core skill and passion for most in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Strong affinity for logic and problem-solving is common in the field.
* **No enjoyment of drawing or writing:** While not impossible for humanities professors, these are often seen as more creative/expressive outlets that someone who enjoys coding might not gravitate towards.

**Important Note:** There's still a chance Jason is in the humanities.  Personality profiles are not perfect predictors, and there are always exceptions within any field. The 0.9 probability reflects a high likelihood, not absolute certainty.
