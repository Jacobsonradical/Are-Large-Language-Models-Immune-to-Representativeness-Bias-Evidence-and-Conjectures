{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science and much stronger indicators than general "talent" or "ambition." 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these, the lack of interest aligns more with the stereotype of the field compared to humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes.  It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to fit Jason's description.
