{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in both fields, but the description emphasizes them in conjunction with his technical skills.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly suggesting a non-humanities field, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own. 

**Important Note:** This is still a probabilistic judgment. The information provided doesn't guarantee Jason's profession. There's a chance he's a humanities professor with atypical interests.
