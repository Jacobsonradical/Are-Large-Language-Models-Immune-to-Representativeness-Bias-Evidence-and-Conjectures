{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A strong affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns well with computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these creative outlets are less central to the field compared to computer science.

**Important Note:**  The probability is high but not absolute (e.g., "1.0"). There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the provided information, it's a statistically safer bet to place him in computer science.
