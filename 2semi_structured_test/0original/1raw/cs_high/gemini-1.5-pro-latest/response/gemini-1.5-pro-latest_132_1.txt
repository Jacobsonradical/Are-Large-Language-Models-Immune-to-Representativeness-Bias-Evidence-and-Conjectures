{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Creative but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many humanities professors are skilled in logic and might enjoy puzzles.  My answer is based on probability, acknowledging there's still a chance Jason could be in the humanities.
