{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in successful individuals across fields but are particularly common in competitive fields like computer science. 

The description offers no strong indicators towards humanities. While he's described as "highly creative," the fact that he dislikes drawing and writing weakens the association with fields like literature or art. 

Considering the base rates: 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science.  Combined with the description leaning towards traits often associated with computer science, the probability is significantly higher than the base rate alone.
