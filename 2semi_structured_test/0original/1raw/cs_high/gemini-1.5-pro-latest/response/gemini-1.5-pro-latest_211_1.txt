{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in both fields but are particularly emphasized in competitive fields like computer science.

The description does mention Jason being highly creative, which might be seen as a counterpoint. However, creativity is not exclusive to humanities; it's crucial in computer science for innovative problem-solving and software development. 

The lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing is not a strong indicator either way. 

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
