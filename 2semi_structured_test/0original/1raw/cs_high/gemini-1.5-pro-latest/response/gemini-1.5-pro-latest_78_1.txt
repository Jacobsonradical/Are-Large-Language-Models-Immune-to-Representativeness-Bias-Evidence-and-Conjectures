{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards suggesting Jason is a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators of an interest in computer science.  
* **Personality:** The description "conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious"  aligns with common stereotypes of successful individuals in technical fields. While these traits can be found in humanities professors too, they are perhaps more typical in STEM fields. 
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:** The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, which is more common in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential biases.  It is crucial to avoid deterministic conclusions. There is a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a passion for logic and coding as a hobby.
