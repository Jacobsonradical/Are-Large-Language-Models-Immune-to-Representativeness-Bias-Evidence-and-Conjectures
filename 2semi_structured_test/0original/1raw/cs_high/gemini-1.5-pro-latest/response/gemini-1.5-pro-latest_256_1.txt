{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals, but combined with his other interests, they further support a computer science leaning.

The fact that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing might seem to suggest humanities, but it's not a strong indicator.  Many people, including those in technical fields, don't enjoy these activities.

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., 1.0). There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.  However, based on the provided information, the evidence heavily favors him being in computer science.
