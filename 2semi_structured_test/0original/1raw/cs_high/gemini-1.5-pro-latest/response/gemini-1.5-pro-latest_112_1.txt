{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily implies Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:** Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often associated with computer science. 
* **Lack of arts inclination:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" suggests his creativity might not align with typical humanities fields.
* **Base Rates:** The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This prior probability significantly influences our estimate.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual interests, or the study might not perfectly represent all professors in those fields.
