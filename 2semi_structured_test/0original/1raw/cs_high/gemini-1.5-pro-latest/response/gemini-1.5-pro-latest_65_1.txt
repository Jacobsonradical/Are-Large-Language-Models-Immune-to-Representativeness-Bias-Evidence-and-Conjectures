{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to one field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the lack of interest slightly leans away from humanities fields where these skills are more central.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual hobbies or a unique combination of traits. However, based on the available data, the probability leans towards him being in computer science.
