{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession from a brief personality sketch, we can make an educated guess based on probability and the information provided:

* **Prior Probability:**  The study started with 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline probability (75/100 = 0.75) that any randomly chosen professor from this group would be from the computer science department.

* **Personality Hints:**  The description highlights several traits often associated with individuals in STEM fields like computer science:
    * **Logical/Analytical:**  Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
    * **Detail-Oriented:** Described as "careful."
    * **Preference for Practicality:** Dislikes drawing and writing, which could be perceived as less practical than coding.

* **Lack of Strong Indicators for Humanities:** The description doesn't strongly suggest traits typically associated with humanities professors (e.g., strong interest in literature, history, philosophy, or the arts). 

**Important Note:** This is still an estimation.  Personality traits are not absolute predictors of profession. Many computer science professors might enjoy creative writing, and many humanities professors could be drawn to logic puzzles.
