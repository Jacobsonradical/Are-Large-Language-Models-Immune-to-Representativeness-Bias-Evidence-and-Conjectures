{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to the following:

* **Stated Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:**  While not all computer scientists dislike drawing or writing, the description highlights a lack of enjoyment in these areas, which are often associated with humanities.
* **General Personality Type:**  Words like "conservative" and "careful" might be stereotypically associated with certain academic fields, but don't offer strong evidence either way. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and conversely, humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.  However, based on the provided information and common stereotypes, a higher probability leans towards Jason being in computer science.
