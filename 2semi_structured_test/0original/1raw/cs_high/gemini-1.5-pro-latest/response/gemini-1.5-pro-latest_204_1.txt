{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have definitive proof, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:**  Strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be typical of individuals drawn to the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming. 
* **Ambitious and talented:**  Success in academia often requires these qualities.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while not eliminating the humanities, makes it less likely he's in that field.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid concluding that *all* computer scientists fit this description or that no humanities professor could fit this description.
