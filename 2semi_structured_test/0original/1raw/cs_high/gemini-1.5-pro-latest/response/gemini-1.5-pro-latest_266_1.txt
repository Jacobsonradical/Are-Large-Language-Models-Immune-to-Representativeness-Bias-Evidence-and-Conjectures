{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with computer science interests.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common in many successful professionals, but perhaps slightly more stereotypical of those in competitive fields like computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  This might suggest a preference for more logic-based activities, again aligning more with a computer science stereotype.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a probabilistic judgment, not a certainty. There are certainly creative and successful humanities professors who dislike drawing and writing, and who might enjoy coding as a hobby. 
* The provided description relies on stereotypes, which can be misleading.  A robust study would analyze the actual personality test data for more objective conclusions. 
* The higher base rate of computer science professors (75 vs. 25) in the study also influences the probability.
