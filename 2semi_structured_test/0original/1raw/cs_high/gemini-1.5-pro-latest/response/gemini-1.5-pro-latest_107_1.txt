{"probability": "0.9"} 

My reasoning:

* **Strong Stereotype Match:** The description aligns strongly with common stereotypes of computer science professionals (e.g., enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, logical).  
* **Lack of Humanities Indicators:** The description lacks typical indicators of someone in the humanities, such as explicitly enjoying writing or drawing. While someone in the humanities *could* still fit this description, it's less likely. 
* **Base Rate Considered:**  There's a higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75%) than humanities professors (25%).

**Important Note:**  This relies heavily on stereotypes and limited information. In reality, personality is a poor predictor of profession, and many humanities professors might share these traits.
