{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a talent for creativity are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.  
* **Lack of Interest:**  The statement that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, while potentially applicable to both fields, further suggests a preference away from the humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The sample size is small. While 75% of the studied professors were in computer science, this doesn't guarantee Jason is one.
* **Stereotypes:**  We should avoid relying solely on stereotypes. It's entirely possible for someone in the humanities to enjoy coding or dislike drawing.

**Conclusion:**

While not certain, the provided information points to a high probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
