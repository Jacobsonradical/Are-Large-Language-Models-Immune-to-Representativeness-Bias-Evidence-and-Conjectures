{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but the combination with his other interests strengthens the likelihood.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  This suggests less inclination towards humanities fields where these are often important skills.

**Important Note:** My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty.  It's possible for someone with Jason's description to be in the humanities, but the evidence points strongly towards computer science.
