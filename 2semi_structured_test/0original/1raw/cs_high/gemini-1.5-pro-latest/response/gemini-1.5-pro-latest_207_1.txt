{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured environments like computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing and writing:**  This suggests a type of creativity that might be more aligned with problem-solving and logic found in computer science rather than the artistic expression often associated with humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor who simply enjoys coding as a hobby. The information provided doesn't allow for a definitive answer.
