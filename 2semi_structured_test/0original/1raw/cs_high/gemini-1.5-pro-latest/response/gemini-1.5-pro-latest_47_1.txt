{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns strongly with typical interests within computer science. 
* **Personality:**  The description highlights traits like "careful" and "ambitious" which could apply to both fields, but are often associated with success in the structured, logic-driven world of computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Inclination:** The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again pointing towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid stereotypes and remember that individuals within any profession can have diverse personalities and interests.
