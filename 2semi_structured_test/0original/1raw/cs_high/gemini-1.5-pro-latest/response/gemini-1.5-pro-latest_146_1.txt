{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across successful individuals in many fields, so they are not as strong of indicators as the previous point.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  While some in the humanities might not enjoy these either, it's less likely to be explicitly stated as a disinterest. 

Considering the stronger indicators related to computer science and the lack of strong indicators for humanities, a probability of 0.9 seems reasonable. However, it's essential to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes, and a true probability would require access to the full study data.
