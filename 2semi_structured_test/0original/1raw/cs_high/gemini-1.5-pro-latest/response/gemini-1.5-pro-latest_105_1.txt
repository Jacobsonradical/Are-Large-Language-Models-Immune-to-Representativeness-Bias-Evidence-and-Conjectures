{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators favoring computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and suggest a strong affinity for the field.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing or writing, while potentially suggesting a disinterest in humanities, isn't as strong an indicator. Many people, regardless of their profession, don't enjoy these activities.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. The actual probability could be different with a more detailed personality profile or knowledge of the base rates of different personality types in each field.
