{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some general personality traits, the key phrase is "Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles...".  These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude in computer science.  

Here's why this pushes the probability significantly higher:

* **Relevance:** These hobbies are directly relevant to the skills needed in computer science. 
* **Uncommon Combination:** While many people enjoy puzzles, the specific combination with coding is more niche and suggests a technical inclination. 
* **Base Rate:** The study already has a higher base rate of computer science professors (75%) compared to humanities professors (25%).

**It's important to note:**

* This is still a probability, not a certainty. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical hobbies. 
* The description lacks strong indicators for humanities, but it doesn't explicitly rule them out. 
 
Therefore, a probability of 0.9 reflects a high likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on the provided information.
