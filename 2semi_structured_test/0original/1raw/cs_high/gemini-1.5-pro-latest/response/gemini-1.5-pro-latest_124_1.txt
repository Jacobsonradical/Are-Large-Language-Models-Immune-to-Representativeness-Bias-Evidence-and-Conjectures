{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it offers strong clues that suggest he is more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals in general but are particularly relevant in competitive fields like computer science.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for logical and technical pursuits over artistic or expressive ones, again aligning more with the stereotype of a computer science professor.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes.  There are certainly creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy coding, and there are computer science professors who are drawn to artistic hobbies.
