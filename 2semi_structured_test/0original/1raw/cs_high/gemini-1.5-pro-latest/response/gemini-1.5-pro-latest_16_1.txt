{"probability": "0.9"} 

My reasoning:

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While not exclusive to computer science, these traits are often associated with methodical and detail-oriented fields like programming. 

The description mentions creativity but highlights a lack of interest in drawing or writing. This could suggest a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, further supporting the likelihood of Jason being in computer science. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimated probability based on limited information. There are creative computer scientists who enjoy art and humanities professors who appreciate logic puzzles.  Without more data, it's impossible to be certain.
