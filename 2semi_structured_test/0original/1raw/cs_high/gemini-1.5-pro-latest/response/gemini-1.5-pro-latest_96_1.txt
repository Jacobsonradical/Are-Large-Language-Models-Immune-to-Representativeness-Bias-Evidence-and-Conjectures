{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several cues strongly suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and computational mindset, common in computer science.
* **Highly Creative but Dislikes Drawing/Writing:** This suggests creativity expressed through technical means rather than artistic ones, again aligning with computer science. 

While humanities professors can be analytical and creative, the specific combination of traits presented makes it significantly more likely that Jason belongs to the computer science group. 

**Important Note:**  My answer is a probability, not a certainty. There's a small chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unusual hobbies. However, based on the available information, it's a less likely scenario.
