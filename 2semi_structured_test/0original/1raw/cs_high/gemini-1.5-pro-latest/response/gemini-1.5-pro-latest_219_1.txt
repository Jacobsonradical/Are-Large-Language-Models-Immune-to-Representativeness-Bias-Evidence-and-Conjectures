{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and strongly suggest an aptitude and interest in the field.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but they are particularly relevant in competitive fields like computer science. 

The description offers no strong indicators of a humanities background. While his enjoyment of jogging and disinterest in drawing/writing are not directly relevant to either field, the other information significantly tips the scales towards computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
