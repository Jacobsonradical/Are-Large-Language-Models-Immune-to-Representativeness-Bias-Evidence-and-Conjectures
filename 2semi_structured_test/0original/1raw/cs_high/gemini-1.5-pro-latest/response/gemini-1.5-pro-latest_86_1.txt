{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing structured thinking and precision. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the lack of interest might suggest a preference for the more technical and less interpretive nature of computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists are artistic. This response is based on a probabilistic interpretation of the provided information, not on definitive assumptions about either field.
