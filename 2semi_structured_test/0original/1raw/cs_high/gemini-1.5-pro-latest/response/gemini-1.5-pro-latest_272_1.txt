{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some clues, it's important to rely on the base rates provided in the study:

* **75% of the professors in the sample are from computer science.**  
* **25% of the professors in the sample are from the humanities.**

The description leans towards a computer science stereotype (enjoys coding, math puzzles), but it's not definitive.  Therefore, it's more likely that Jason falls within the larger group (computer science) based purely on the odds presented in the study's design. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment, not a certainty. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual interests.
