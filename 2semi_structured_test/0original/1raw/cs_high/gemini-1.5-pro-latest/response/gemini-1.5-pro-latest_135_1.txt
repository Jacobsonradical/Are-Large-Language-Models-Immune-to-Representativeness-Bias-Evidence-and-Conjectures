{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:**  While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the lack of interest slightly reduces the likelihood of Jason being in a humanities field where these skills are often more central.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There are creative and ambitious individuals in both computer science and the humanities, and personality alone cannot definitively determine someone's profession.
