{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligned with interests common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These are general traits found in successful individuals across many fields.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for logical and technical pursuits over more artistic or expressive ones, again aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are certainly creative and artistic individuals within computer science, and humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.
