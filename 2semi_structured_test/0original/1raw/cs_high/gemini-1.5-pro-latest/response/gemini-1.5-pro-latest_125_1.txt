{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:**  This makes it somewhat less likely he's in the humanities, where writing is often a core activity. 

**Important Note:** This probability is based on stereotypes and limited information. There are certainly creative and ambitious individuals in humanities who dislike drawing and writing, just as there are computer scientists who enjoy those activities.
