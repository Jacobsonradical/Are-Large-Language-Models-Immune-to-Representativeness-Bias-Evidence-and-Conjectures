{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues strongly suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** Explicitly enjoying coding is a much stronger indicator of being in computer science than humanities.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for this type of problem-solving aligns more with the skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some humanities professors might not enjoy these either, it's a more notable contrast with Jason's "highly creative" trait if he's in a field where those skills are often directly applicable.

**Important Notes:**

* This is based on probabilities and stereotypes. There are creative computer scientists who draw, and humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.
* The sample size is small.  Even if all factors accurately reflect real-world trends, individual variation is high.
*  My 0.9 probability is a high confidence level, but not absolute certainty.
