{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Personality:**  While "conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, "ambitious" is often associated with the career progression in fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Interest:**  The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further points away from humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests. However, based on the provided information, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
