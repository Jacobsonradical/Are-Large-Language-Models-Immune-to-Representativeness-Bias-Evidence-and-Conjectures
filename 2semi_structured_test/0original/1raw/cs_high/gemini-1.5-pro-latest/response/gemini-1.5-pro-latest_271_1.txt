{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with interests and skills common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across successful individuals in many fields, but they're particularly relevant in the competitive field of computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits, again aligning more with computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description leans towards a computer science profile, it's entirely possible for someone in the humanities to share these traits. The higher probability simply reflects the provided information, not a definitive judgment.
