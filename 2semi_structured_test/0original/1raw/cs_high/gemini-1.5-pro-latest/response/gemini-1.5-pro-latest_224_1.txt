{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators that make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligned with computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to one field, could be slightly more associated with the structured nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** This suggests a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits, again pointing towards computer science.

**Important Note:** 

It's crucial to remember this is a probability, not a certainty. There could be humanities professors who fit Jason's description perfectly. The higher probability simply reflects that the provided information aligns more strongly with the stereotypical image of a computer science professor.
