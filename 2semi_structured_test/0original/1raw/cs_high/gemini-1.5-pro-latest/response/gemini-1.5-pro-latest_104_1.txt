{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a statement about not enjoying drawing or writing strongly align with common stereotypes and interests associated with computer science. 
* **Personality:**  Traits like "conservative" and "careful" could be applied to either field, but when combined with the strong technical interests, they further tilt the scales towards computer science.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:**  It's crucial to acknowledge that relying on stereotypes can be misleading. There are many creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or even coding. 
* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is not a very large sample size, so generalizations should be made with caution.

**Overall:** While more information would be ideal, based on the provided description and common associations, a probability of 0.9 (90%) that Jason is a computer science professor seems reasonable.
