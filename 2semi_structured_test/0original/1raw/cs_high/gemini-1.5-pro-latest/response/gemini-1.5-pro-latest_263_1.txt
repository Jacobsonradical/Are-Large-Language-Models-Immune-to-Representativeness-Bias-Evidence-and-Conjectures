{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor due to the strong alignment with stereotypical interests in that field:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** Directly relevant to computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:**  While these traits aren't exclusive to any field, they are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming.
* **Ambitious:**  Success in both academia and computer science often requires high ambition.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for more technical pursuits.  

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases.  While the description aligns with a computer science stereotype, there's still a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. A 0.9 probability reflects this uncertainty while acknowledging the provided information.
