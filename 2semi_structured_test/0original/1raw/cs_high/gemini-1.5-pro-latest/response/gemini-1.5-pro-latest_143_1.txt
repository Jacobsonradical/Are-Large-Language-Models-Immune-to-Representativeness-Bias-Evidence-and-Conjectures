{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Creative, but...**: The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests his creativity might be channeled into more technical or problem-solving areas.

**Important Note:** This is based on probabilistic reasoning from a limited description. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
