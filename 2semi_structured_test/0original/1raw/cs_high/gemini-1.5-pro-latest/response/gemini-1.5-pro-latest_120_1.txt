{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  Explicit mention of coding is a strong indicator for computer science. 
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for mathematical puzzles aligns more with computer science than humanities.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor,  a disinterest in these creative outlets further tips the scales towards a technical field like computer science. 

**Important Note:** My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty. There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the available information, it's a statistically safer bet to assume he's in computer science.
