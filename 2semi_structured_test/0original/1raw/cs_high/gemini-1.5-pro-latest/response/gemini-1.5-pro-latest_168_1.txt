{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily implies Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing/writing strongly align with stereotypes and common interests within the computer science field. 
* **Personality:**  Traits like "careful" and "talented" could apply to both fields, but  "ambitious" is often associated with fields like computer science where career progression and entrepreneurial opportunities are prevalent.

**Important Note:** This is based on limited information and stereotypes. There are many creative and successful humanities professors who might also fit this description. The probability is high, but not absolute.
