{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across successful individuals in many fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in either field and don't strongly suggest one over the other.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a leaning away from humanities, but it's not conclusive.

**The most significant factor is the clear preference for activities closely related to computer science.** While a humanities professor *could* enjoy coding and puzzles, it's statistically more likely that Jason's profile aligns with the computer science group.

**Important Note:** This probability is based on limited information and stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.  A more accurate prediction would require analyzing the personality descriptions of all 100 professors and identifying trends within each group.
