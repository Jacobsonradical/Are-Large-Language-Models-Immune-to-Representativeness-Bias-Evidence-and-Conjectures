{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are strong indicators aligning with computer science. 
* **Personality:** While "conservative" and "careful" are not exclusive to any field, they are often associated with detail-oriented work common in computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Interests:** The explicit mention that he dislikes drawing and writing, despite being creative, further suggests a preference for technical fields over humanities.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description makes a computer science background more likely, it's not guaranteed. There are creative and ambitious individuals in humanities who might fit this description as well.
