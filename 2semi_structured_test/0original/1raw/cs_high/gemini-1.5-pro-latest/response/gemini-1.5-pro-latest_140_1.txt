{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data on the personality traits of all computer science vs. humanities professors, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset, common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could align with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 

It's important to note:

* **Sample size:** We only have a description of one professor, not information about the general traits of the other 99.
* **Stereotypes:**  We should be cautious about relying too heavily on stereotypes. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.

**Therefore, while not certain, there is a high probability based on the provided description that Jason is a computer science professor.**
