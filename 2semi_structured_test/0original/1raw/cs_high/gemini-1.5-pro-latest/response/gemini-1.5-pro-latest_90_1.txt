{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities strongly aligned with computer science. 
* **Personality:** The description mentions he is "talented" and "ambitious," traits often associated with successful academics, but the lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing (despite being creative) further points towards a technical field like computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes. There are creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles, and there are computer scientists who enjoy artistic pursuits. This response provides a probability based on the provided data and common perceptions.
