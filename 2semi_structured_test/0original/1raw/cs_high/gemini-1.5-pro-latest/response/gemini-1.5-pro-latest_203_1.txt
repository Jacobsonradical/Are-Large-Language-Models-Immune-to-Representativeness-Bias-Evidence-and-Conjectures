{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest and likely aptitude for computer science.
* **Highly Creative:** Creativity is important in both fields, but manifests differently. Jason's creativity seemingly leans towards problem-solving and logic, common in computer science. 
* **Dislike of Drawing and Writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and logical expression over artistic or narrative forms, further pointing towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information. It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to have Jason's interests, or for a computer scientist to be highly artistic. The description provides clues, but not a definitive answer.
