{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and strong indicators of aptitude and interest in the field. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, align with stereotypes of the field often associated with logical thinking and meticulousness.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are more central to humanities fields.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. There are creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. The provided probability is simply an educated guess based on the available data.
