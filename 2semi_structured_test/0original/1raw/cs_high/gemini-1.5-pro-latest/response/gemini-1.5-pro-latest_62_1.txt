{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotypes:**  The description highlights traits often associated with individuals in STEM fields, particularly computer science:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles 
    * Logical and analytical (implied by "careful")
    * Creative within a technical context ("highly creative" but dislikes drawing and writing)
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:** The description doesn't offer strong indicators that would point towards a humanities profession.  While some humanities professors might enjoy puzzles or be ambitious, the overall profile leans heavily towards a technical field.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid definitive judgments based on stereotypes.  There are certainly creative and technically-minded individuals in the humanities, just as there are computer scientists who enjoy artistic pursuits. This response is based on probabilistic reasoning given the information provided.
