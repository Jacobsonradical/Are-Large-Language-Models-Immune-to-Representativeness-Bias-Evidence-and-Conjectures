{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no information explicitly stating Jason's profession, the description heavily implies he's likely in computer science:

* **Coding:** A strong indicator for computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:** Align with computational thinking common in computer science.
* **Ambitious & Talented:**  These traits are generally found in successful professionals, but the combination with the above makes computer science more likely.

The description lacks strong indicators for humanities:

* **Conservative:**  Doesn't strongly favor either field.
* **Careful:** Could apply to both.
* **Enjoys jogging & Family man:** Not particularly relevant to either field.
* **Dislike for drawing/writing:**  While suggestive of non-humanities, it's not conclusive (many people dislike these regardless of profession).

**Important Note:** My answer is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is in the humanities, but the provided description makes it more likely he's in computer science.
