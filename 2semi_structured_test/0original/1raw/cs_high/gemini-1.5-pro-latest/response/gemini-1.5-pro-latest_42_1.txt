{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a talent for creativity are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.  
* **Lack of Interest:** While not all computer scientists enjoy drawing or writing, the description specifically mentions these as things Jason does *not* enjoy, potentially contrasting with common humanities interests. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, the provided profile makes a computer science background significantly more likely.
