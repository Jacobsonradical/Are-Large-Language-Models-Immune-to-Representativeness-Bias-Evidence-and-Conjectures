{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators suggesting he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but they're particularly relevant in the competitive world of computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are generally considered less central to the field compared to humanities.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are certainly humanities professors who love coding and computer science professors who are talented writers. However, based on the provided information and the higher likelihood of the described interests aligning with computer science, a probability leaning towards that field is more statistically sound.
