{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset, common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits can be found in both fields, they might be slightly more prevalent in the stereotype of a computer scientist.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and less artistic pursuits, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.  The higher probability simply reflects that the provided description aligns more with a stereotypical image of a computer science professor.
