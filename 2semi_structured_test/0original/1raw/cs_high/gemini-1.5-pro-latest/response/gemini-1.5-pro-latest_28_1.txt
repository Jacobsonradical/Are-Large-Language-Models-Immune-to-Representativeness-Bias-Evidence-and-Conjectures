{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:**  These traits are common across successful individuals in many fields, so they are less informative for our prediction.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  This could suggest a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many humanities professors might also enjoy coding or be conservative.  The provided probability is based on a slight leaning based on common trends, not a definitive judgment.
