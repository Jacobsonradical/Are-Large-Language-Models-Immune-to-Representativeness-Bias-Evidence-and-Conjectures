{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:**  This is a very strong indicator for a computer science professor. 
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Aligns strongly with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be seen as more typical in a structured field like computer science.

The only mildly contrasting element is the statement that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing. While some might see this as pointing away from computer science, many programmers find creative outlets in code itself and might not be drawn to more visual or language-based arts.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  There are undoubtedly creative and artistic computer scientists, just as there are humanities professors who might enjoy logic puzzles. This answer is based on probabilities given the information provided, not on absolute assumptions.
