{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science and less common in humanities fields.
* **Talented and Ambitious:** These traits are found in both fields, but the specific combination with his hobbies further points towards a technical field.

It's important to acknowledge that this is still a probability, not a certainty. Some humanities professors might enjoy coding or logic puzzles. However, the evidence presented makes it significantly more likely that Jason belongs to the larger group of 75 computer science professors.
