{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across both fields, but the combination, along with his other interests, strengthens the likelihood of him being in a competitive field like computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for more logic-driven and less expressive activities, again more aligned with computer science stereotypes.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is a probability based on limited information and stereotypes. There are creative and successful individuals in both fields who might not fit the typical mold.
