{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core elements of computer science and highly suggestive of the field. 
* **Talent and Ambition:** These traits are common to successful individuals in many fields, but combined with the previous point, further support the likelihood of him being in computer science.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** While not all computer scientists dislike these activities, it somewhat contrasts with a stereotypical humanities professor who might engage in creative writing or art appreciation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher base probability (75%) of any random professor in the study being from computer science.
* **Individual Variation:**  Personality traits are not exclusive to specific professions. Plenty of humanities professors might enjoy coding, and some computer scientists might love drawing. 

**Conclusion:**

While not definitive, the provided information significantly increases the probability of Jason being a computer science professor compared to the base rate. A probability of 0.9 reflects this high likelihood while acknowledging the possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
