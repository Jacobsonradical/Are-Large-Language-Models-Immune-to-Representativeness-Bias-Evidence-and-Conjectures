{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, there are strong indicators favoring computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with computer science interests. 
* **Lack of enjoyment in drawing/writing:**  While some computer scientists are artistic, the description contrasts his creativity with a disinterest in typical humanities-related creative outlets.

**Important Note:** My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the provided information, computer science is the significantly more likely field.
