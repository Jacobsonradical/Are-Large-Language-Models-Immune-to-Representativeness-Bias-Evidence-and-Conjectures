{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests highly aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in structured fields like computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, a lack of interest might suggest a preference for the more logic-driven nature of computer science. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are creative and artistic computer scientists, and there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. This response is based on probabilistic reasoning given the information provided, not on definitive assumptions about either profession.
