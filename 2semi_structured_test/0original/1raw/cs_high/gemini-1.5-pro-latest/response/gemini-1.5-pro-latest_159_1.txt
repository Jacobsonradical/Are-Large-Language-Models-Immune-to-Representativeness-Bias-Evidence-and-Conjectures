{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but combined with his other interests, they further support the likelihood of him being in a technical field.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, this suggests a preference for logical and analytical tasks over creative writing or visual arts often associated with humanities disciplines.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the provided profile, it's more probable he belongs to the computer science group.
