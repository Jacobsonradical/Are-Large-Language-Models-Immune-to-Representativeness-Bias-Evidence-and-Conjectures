{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more associated with the structured nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not definitive, this leans away from humanities which often involve visual or written creativity.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists are artistic.  The probability is based on a slight leaning based on the provided information, not absolute certainty.
