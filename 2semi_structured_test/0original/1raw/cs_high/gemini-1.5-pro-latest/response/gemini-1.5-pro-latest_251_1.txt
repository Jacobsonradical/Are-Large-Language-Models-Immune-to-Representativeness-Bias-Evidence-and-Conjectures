{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science and suggest a strong affinity for the field.
* **Talented:**  While applicable to both fields, "talented" combined with his other interests leans towards technical skill.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for logical and technical pursuits over more artistic or expressive ones often associated with humanities.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Many computer scientists are artistic, and many humanities professors are analytical. However, given the limited information and the probability task, we base our answer on the presented traits and their stronger association with the computer science field *within the context of this particular study*.
