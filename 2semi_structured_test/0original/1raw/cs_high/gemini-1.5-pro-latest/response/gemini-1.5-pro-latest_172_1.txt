{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a very strong indicator for a computer science professor.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This aligns strongly with the analytical and problem-solving skills common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in successful individuals across fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits don't heavily favor either field.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While this might suggest a less humanities-oriented personality, it's not a definitive marker.

**Considering the base rate:** It's crucial to remember that the sample has 3 times more computer science professors (75) than humanities professors (25).

**Therefore, while not certain, it's significantly more probable that Jason, with his clear inclination towards activities closely associated with computer science, belongs to that group.**
