{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not foolproof, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests creativity channeled into technical fields rather than artistic ones. 

The description offers no hints towards humanities interests. While a humanities professor *could* have these traits, they are more commonly associated with computer science. Therefore, the probability is high, but not absolute (as there could be outliers within any profession).
