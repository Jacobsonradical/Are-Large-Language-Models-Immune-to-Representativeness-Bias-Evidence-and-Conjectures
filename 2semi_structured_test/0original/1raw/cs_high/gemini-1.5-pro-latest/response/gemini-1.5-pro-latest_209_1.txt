{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for technical and logical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

While it's possible for someone in the humanities to possess these traits, the combination strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. 

**Important Note:** This is still a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.
