{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  Explicitly mentioning "coding" is a strong indicator of computer science interest.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for mathematical puzzles aligns more with the skills and interests often found in computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, the lack of enjoyment in these areas further suggests a leaning towards a more technical field.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.  However, based on the provided profile, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
