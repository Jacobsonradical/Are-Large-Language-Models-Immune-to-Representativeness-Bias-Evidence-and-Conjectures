{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively say Jason is a computer science professor, the following points strongly suggest it:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** While not absolute, this might suggest a preference for more technical fields over humanities.

Given the relatively small sample size and the strong correlation between Jason's description and typical traits associated with computer science, there's a high probability he belongs to that group. However, it's not a certainty (1.0) as individuals within any profession can have diverse interests.
