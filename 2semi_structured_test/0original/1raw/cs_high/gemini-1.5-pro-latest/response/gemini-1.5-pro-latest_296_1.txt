{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards traits commonly associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, can be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of the field.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:**  While some computer scientists may enjoy these activities, the lack of interest slightly increases the probability of Jason being in a field where these aren't primary skills. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, based on the available data, it's more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
