{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively state Jason's profession, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in either field, but they don't strongly suggest one over the other.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for fields less reliant on visual or narrative creativity.

**Important Note:**  This is simply an educated guess based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and coding as hobbies. Without more information, it's impossible to be 100% certain.
