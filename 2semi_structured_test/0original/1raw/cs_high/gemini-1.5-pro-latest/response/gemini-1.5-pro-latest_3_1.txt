{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Talent and ambition:** These traits are found in successful individuals across fields, so they're less informative for this specific distinction.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** While some computer scientists may enjoy these, the phrasing suggests a potential preference against activities often associated with humanities.

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., "1.0"). There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests, highlighting the limitations of inferring profession solely from personality and limited information.
