{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These are general traits of successful individuals in many fields, so they don't offer strong evidence either way.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for technical fields over humanities.

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (1.0) because:

* The description is limited and based on interpretation.
* People in the humanities can also enjoy logic puzzles and be conservative.
* Individual personalities within any profession can be diverse. 

A more definitive answer would require analyzing the full dataset and identifying trends across all professors.
