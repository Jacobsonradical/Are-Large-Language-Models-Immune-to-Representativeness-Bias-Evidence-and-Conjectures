{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly associated with computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests his creativity is channeled into fields that don't rely heavily on visual or literary arts, which aligns better with computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description fits common perceptions of computer scientists,  there are certainly creative and artistic individuals in that field, just as there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles. The probability given is simply based on the likelihood given the provided information.
