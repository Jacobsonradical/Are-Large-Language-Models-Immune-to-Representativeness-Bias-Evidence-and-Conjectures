{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but combined with the previous point, they further support a computer science leaning.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:**  This suggests less inclination towards humanities, though not impossible. 

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute.  There's always a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual interests, or the study's sample doesn't perfectly reflect the broader population of professors.
