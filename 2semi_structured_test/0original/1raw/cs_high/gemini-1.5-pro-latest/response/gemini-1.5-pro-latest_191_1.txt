{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a core skill in computer science and not usually associated with the humanities.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A preference for this type of problem-solving aligns more with computer science. 
* **Not Enjoying Drawing or Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these are often creative outlets enjoyed by people in those fields.

**Important Note:**  My answer is a high probability, not certainty.  It's possible for someone with Jason's traits to be in the humanities, but the evidence points towards computer science.
