{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with interests and skills common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** While these traits can be found in both fields, they might be slightly more common in the structured world of computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:**  These are success-driving traits found in both fields, so they don't offer strong differentiation.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for logical/analytical tasks over more expressive ones, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with an atypical profile.
