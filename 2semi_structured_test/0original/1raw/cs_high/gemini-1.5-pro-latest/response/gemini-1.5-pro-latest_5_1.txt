{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding:** A highly specific interest closely aligned with computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Another common trait among those drawn to computer science and related fields.
* **"Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing"**: This statement seems to contrast Jason's analytical skills with  activities often associated with humanities. 

It's important to remember:

* **Not all computer scientists fit this mold:**  There are creative computer scientists who enjoy arts.
* **Humanities professors can be analytical:** Some might enjoy puzzles or have backgrounds in areas overlapping with computational thinking.

However, based on the provided information and common stereotypes associated with these fields, a high probability leaning towards computer science is warranted.
