{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as a slight indicator against humanities, though it's not definitive.

It's crucial to remember that this is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There are certainly creative and ambitious individuals in the humanities who fit parts of Jason's description. However, the combined presence of coding, mathematical puzzles, and the other traits makes a higher probability for computer science more likely.
