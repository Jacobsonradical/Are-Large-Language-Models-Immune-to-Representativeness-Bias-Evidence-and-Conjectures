{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly suggestive of computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:** A strong affinity for math aligns more with computer science than humanities.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in the stereotype of a computer science professor.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid strong biases. The description could fit someone in either field, and many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles or even dabble in coding.  The probability is high but not absolute.
