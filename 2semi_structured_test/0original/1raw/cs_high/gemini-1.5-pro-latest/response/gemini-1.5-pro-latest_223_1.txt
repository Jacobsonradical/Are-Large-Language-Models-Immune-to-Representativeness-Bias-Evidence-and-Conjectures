{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of interests aligning with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of programming. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the wording suggests a potential contrast with Jason's enjoyment of more technical pursuits.

**Important Note:**  This is a probability based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unusual hobbies, or that the study revealed unexpected personality trends.
