{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a disinterest in drawing/writing align strongly with computer science stereotypes. 
* **Personality:**  While "conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious" could apply to both fields, they are not unusual traits in successful academics generally.
* **Base Rate:** There's a higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75 vs. 25).

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. It's entirely possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding or be ambitious.  We cannot definitively determine Jason's profession from this description alone.
