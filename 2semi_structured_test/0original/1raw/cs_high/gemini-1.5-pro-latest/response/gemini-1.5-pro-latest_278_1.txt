{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with the skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found in successful individuals across many fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in either field and don't strongly suggest one over the other.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for logical and structured thinking over artistic expression, which could be slightly more common in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a passion for logic puzzles and coding as a hobby. The higher probability assigned here is due to the stronger alignment of his described interests with the computer science field.
