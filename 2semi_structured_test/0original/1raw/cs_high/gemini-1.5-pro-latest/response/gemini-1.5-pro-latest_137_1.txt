{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science professionals:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, aligning more with computer science.

While someone in the humanities *could* have these traits, they are more common in the computer science field.  

The sample size also plays a role. There are three times as many computer science professors in the study. This prior probability significantly influences the final assessment. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  It's not a certainty. Jason's personality could fit a humanities professor with specific interests (digital humanities, computational linguistics, etc.).
