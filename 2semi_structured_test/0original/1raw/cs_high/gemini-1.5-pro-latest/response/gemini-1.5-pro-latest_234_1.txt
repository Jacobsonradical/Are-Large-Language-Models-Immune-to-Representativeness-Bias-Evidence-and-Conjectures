{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have definitive proof, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical creativity over artistic expression, again aligning with computer science. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The study has a larger sample size of computer science professors (75 vs. 25), making it more likely Jason belongs to that group from a purely statistical standpoint.
* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this relies on stereotypes about fields. There are artistic and expressive computer scientists, just as there are highly logical individuals in the humanities. However, based on the provided information and common perceptions, the probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor.
