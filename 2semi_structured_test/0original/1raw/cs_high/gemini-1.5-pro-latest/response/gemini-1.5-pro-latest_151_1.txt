{"probability": "0.9"} 

My reasoning:

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are core activities within computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while found in any field, can be connected to the detail-oriented nature of programming.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:** This contrasts with typical humanities interests.

Importantly, the description doesn't offer strong indicators suggesting Jason is in the humanities. The base rate of computer science professors in the study (75%) is also important to consider. 

Therefore, a probability of 0.9 reflects the information provided, acknowledging  it's not a certainty.
