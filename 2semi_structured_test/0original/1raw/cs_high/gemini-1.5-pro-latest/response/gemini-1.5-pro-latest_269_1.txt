{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an interest in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with structured and logical thinking, which is prevalent in computer science. 

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might suggest a leaning away from the humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own.

**Important Note:**  This is just a probability based on limited information.  The actual probability could be different.  The study might reveal that many successful humanities professors also enjoy coding or that other factors outweigh those presented in the description.
