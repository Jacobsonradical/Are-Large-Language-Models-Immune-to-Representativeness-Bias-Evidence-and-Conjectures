{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a preference for logic-based tasks (implied by not enjoying drawing or writing) align strongly with common interests in computer science. 
* **Personality:**  The description doesn't offer strong indicators either way for humanities or computer science. "Conservative and careful" could apply to both fields.
* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This means there's a higher baseline chance of any random professor in the study being from computer science.

**Important Note:**  This is still a probability, not a certainty. It's entirely possible for a humanities professor to fit Jason's description.
