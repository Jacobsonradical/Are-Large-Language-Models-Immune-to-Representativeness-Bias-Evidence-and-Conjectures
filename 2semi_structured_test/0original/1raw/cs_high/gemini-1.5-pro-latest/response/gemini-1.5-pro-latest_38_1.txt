{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with computer science interests. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:** This suggests a preference for technical over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
