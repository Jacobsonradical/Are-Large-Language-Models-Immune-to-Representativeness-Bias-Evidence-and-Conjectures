{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively state Jason's profession, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but particularly in the competitive field of computer science.

The fact that he dislikes drawing and writing, while potentially relevant to some humanities disciplines, is not a strong indicator against him being in computer science.  

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. However, the available evidence makes it significantly more likely he's in computer science.
