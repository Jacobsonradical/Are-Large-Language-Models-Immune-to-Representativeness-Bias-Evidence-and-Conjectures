{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these points:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset often found in computer science. 
* **Lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing:**  This suggests a preference for technical and less artistic pursuits, further aligning with the computer science field.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:** The study has a larger sample size of computer science professors (75) compared to humanities professors (25). This statistically makes it more likely Jason belongs to the larger group.
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to avoid strong stereotypes. While the description fits a common perception of computer scientists, many individuals in humanities can also be analytical and enjoy logic puzzles.

**Conclusion:**

While there's no guarantee, the provided information makes it significantly more probable that Jason is a computer science professor. A probability of 0.9 reflects this strong likelihood while acknowledging the possibility that he could be in the humanities.
