{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these strong indicators:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and highly suggestive of an inclination towards the field. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This contrast reinforces the likelihood of his creativity being channeled into more technical avenues like programming, a common trait among computer scientists.

Considering these factors, a probability of 0.9 reflects a high likelihood that Jason belongs to the computer science professor group. However, it's important to remember this is based on limited information and stereotypes. There's a small chance Jason could be a humanities professor with an unusual hobby or a unique combination of skills.
