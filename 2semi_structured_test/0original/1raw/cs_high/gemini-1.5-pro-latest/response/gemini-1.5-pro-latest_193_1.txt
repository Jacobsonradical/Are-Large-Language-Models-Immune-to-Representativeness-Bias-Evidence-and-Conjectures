{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These activities strongly align with skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Less Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these, the description emphasizes Jason's lack of interest, making it slightly less likely he's in a humanities field where these skills are often emphasized. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests. The higher probability simply reflects that the provided description aligns more commonly with computer science stereotypes.
