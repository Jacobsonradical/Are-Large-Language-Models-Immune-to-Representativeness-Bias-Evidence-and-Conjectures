{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests commonly associated with computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in a field emphasizing logic and precision.

The description lacks strong indicators typically associated with humanities professors, such as a passion for literature, history, or the arts.  

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's impossible to be 100% certain about Jason's profession based solely on this description.
