{"probability": "0.85"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest Computer Science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a highly specific interest directly tied to computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Strong mathematical aptitude is common and often necessary in computer science.
* **Conservative, careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be associated with the detail-oriented and methodical nature of programming.

The lack of interest in drawing or writing might be seen as countering humanities, but it's not a strong indicator by itself. Many people, including those in technical fields, don't enjoy these activities.

**The higher base rate of computer science professors (75%) in the sample significantly influences the probability.**  Even without the personality hints, there's a higher chance of any random professor in the study being from computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There is no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor, and other factors not described could influence his actual field.
