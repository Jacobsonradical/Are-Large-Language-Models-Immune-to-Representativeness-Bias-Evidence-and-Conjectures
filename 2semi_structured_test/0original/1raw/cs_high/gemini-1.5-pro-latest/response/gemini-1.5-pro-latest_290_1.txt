{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests strongly align with computer science:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are core activities within computer science. 
* **Lack of artistic inclination:** The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further suggests a preference for the logical and technical over the artistic, aligning more with a computer science profile.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember this is just a probability based on limited information.  Many humanities professors could also enjoy logic puzzles or have analytical minds.  Without analyzing the personality test results and the full context of the study, it's impossible to be certain.
