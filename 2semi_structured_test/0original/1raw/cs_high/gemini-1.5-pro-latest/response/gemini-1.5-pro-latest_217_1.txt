{"probability": "0.85"} 

My reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:**  We start with a higher baseline probability that Jason is a computer science professor (75 computer science professors vs. 25 humanities professors). This gives a prior probability of 0.75.
* **Personality Description:** The description leans towards traits often associated with computer science: 
    * "Enjoys coding" is a strong indicator.
    * "Solving mathematical puzzles" further reinforces this.
    * While "highly creative" can apply to both fields, the lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing suggests a preference for more structured, logical activities.

* **Not Definitive:**  It's important to note that this is just one description, and personality traits are not always perfect predictors of profession. There could be highly logical and analytical humanities professors. 

Therefore, while not certain, the provided information significantly increases the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. My estimate of 0.85 reflects this increased likelihood.
