{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence of Jason's profession, it heavily implies a strong inclination towards analytical and logical thinking, traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:**  These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, including academia.
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits could apply to both fields, but are perhaps more stereotypical of someone in a detail-oriented field like computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for logical and structured tasks over more creative or expressive ones, again hinting towards computer science.

Furthermore, the sample size of computer science professors (75) is three times larger than that of humanities professors (25). 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There is a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and structure. However, based on the available data, it is more likely he belongs to the computer science group.
