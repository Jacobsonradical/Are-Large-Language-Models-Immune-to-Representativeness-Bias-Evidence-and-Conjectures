{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a very strong indicator, as it's a core skill in computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  An affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns well with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be seen as more common in the structured world of computer science compared to some humanities disciplines. 

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while potentially fitting a computer science stereotype, isn't as strong an indicator. Many people in the humanities also don't prioritize visual or creative writing in their work. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with unique interests.
