{"probability": "0.85"}

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to determine Jason's profession based solely on this description, we can make an educated guess using the provided information and some common stereotypes (which are not always accurate, but we'll use them for this exercise).

* **Strong Indicators for Computer Science:**
    * Enjoys coding 
    * Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles
    * Talented (potentially in a technical field)
    * Ambitious (common trait in competitive fields) 

* **Neutral Indicators:**
    * 45 years old, married with five children (doesn't strongly suggest either field)
    * Conservative, careful (could apply to either field)
    * Enjoys jogging (doesn't strongly suggest either field)

* **Weak Indicator Against Humanities:**
    * Does not enjoy drawing or writing (while some humanities professors might not enjoy these, it's generally considered a less likely trait)

**Calculating Probability:**

The information leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor.  Since 75% of the study participants were computer science professors, our base probability starts at 0.75.  The description further reinforces this likelihood. While not definitive, it's highly probable given the evidence. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is just an estimated probability based on limited information and potential stereotypes. We cannot definitively determine Jason's profession from the description alone.
