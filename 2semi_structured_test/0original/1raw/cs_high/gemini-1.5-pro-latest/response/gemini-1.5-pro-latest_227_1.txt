{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** Explicitly mentioned interest, a strong indicator for computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:** Aligns strongly with computer science thinking.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured nature of programming. 

The lack of interest in drawing or writing, while potentially fitting a computer science stereotype, is not a strong indicator by itself. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists are artistic. This response leans on probabilities based on common associations, not definitive proof.
