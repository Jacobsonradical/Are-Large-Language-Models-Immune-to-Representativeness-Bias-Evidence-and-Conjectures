{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides information that could be associated with both fields, some key points increase the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a strong indicator, as coding is a fundamental skill in computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This aligns strongly with the logical and analytical thinking required in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, could be associated with the meticulous nature of programming and software development.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as slightly pointing away from humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator on its own. 

Given the information provided, it's more likely that Jason's profile aligns with that of a computer science professor.  Since 75% of the study participants were computer science professors (75 out of 100), the probability is **0.75**.
