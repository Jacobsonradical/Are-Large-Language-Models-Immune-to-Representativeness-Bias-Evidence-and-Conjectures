{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues point to a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly indicative of computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  A strong affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns strongly with the field.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, are often associated with structured and detail-oriented fields.

The description lacks strong indicators of a humanities background. While Jason is creative, his disinterest in drawing and writing makes it less likely he's in a humanities field that often values those skills. 

**Important Note:** This is based on probabilities and stereotypes. There are certainly creative and successful humanities professors who enjoy coding or dislike drawing. The provided information doesn't guarantee Jason's field, but makes it more likely he's in computer science.
