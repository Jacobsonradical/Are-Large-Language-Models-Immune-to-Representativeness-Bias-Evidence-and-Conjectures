{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an aptitude and interest often found in computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but they align well with the competitive and demanding nature of computer science research.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for someone in the humanities, these activities are less central to computer science, making it slightly more likely that Jason belongs to this field.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information.  There are certainly creative and successful individuals in the humanities who fit Jason's description as well.
