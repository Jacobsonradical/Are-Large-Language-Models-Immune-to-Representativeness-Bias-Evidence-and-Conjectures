{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a very strong indicator for a computer science professor.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:** This aligns well with the logical and problem-solving skills valued in computer science. 
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less central to the field compared to computer science.

The other details (age, marital status, children) are less informative for this specific question. 

**Important Note:** My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty. It's possible for a humanities professor to fit this description, but it's statistically more likely Jason belongs to the larger computer science group in the study.
