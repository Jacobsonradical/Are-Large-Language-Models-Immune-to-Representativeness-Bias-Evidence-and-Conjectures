{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point to a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the detail-oriented and logical nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are more commonly associated with humanities fields.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. It's impossible to be 100% certain about Jason's profession based solely on this description.
