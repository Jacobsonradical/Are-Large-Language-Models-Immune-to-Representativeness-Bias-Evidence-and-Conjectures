{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

There is a higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75 vs. 25). While the description provides some clues that might be stereotypically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles), it's not definitive. Therefore, it's more likely that Jason, based purely on the higher representation, is one of the computer science professors. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and potential stereotypes. We shouldn't assume Jason's profession based solely on these traits.
