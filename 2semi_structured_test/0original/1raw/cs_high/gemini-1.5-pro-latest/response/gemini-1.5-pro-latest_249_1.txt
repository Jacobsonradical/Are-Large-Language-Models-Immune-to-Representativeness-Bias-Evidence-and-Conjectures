{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** This contrasts with typical interests often found in humanities fields.

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate based on limited information.  It's crucial to avoid stereotyping. Many individuals in the humanities enjoy logic puzzles and coding, and many computer scientists are artistic. This response simply highlights which clues tilt the probability in a particular direction based on common trends.
