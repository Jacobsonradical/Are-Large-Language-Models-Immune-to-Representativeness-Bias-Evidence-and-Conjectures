{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be seen as aligning with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests creativity channeled through a different medium, potentially coding.

The description lacks strong indicators of humanities interests.  Therefore, it's more likely Jason belongs to the larger (75%) computer science group.  

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic answer based on limited information and stereotypes.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests.
