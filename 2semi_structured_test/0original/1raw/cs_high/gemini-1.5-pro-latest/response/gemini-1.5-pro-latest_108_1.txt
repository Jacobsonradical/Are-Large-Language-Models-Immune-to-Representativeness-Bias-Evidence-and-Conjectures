{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data on the specific personality traits that correlate with each profession, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, can be associated with methodical and detail-oriented work, often found in programming and software development. 

The description lacks strong indicators of someone in the humanities. While Jason is described as creative, his disinterest in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for more logic-based creative outlets often found in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid deterministic conclusions about a person's profession based solely on personality descriptions.
