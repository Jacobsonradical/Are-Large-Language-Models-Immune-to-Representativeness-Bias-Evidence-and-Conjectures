{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:**  Enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and having a talent for them are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, common traits in computer science. 
* **Lack of arts inclination:** Explicitly stating he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, while being creative, further points away from humanities.
* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This prior probability significantly influences the likelihood.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  While the description leans heavily towards computer science,  there are creative and analytical individuals in humanities fields as well. This response is based on probabilities within the context of the provided information.
