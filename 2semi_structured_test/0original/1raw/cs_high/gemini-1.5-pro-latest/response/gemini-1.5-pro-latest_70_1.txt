{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding:** This skill is highly specific to computer science and directly relevant to the field. 
* **Mathematical Puzzles:** An affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns strongly with a computer science career. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less central to their work compared to computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. The actual probability could be different. Other factors, not mentioned in the description, could influence Jason's profession.
