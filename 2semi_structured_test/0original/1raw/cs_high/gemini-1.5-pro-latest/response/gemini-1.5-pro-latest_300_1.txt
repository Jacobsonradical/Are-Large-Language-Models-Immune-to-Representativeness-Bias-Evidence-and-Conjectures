{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest computer science:

* **Coding:** This is a highly specific skill almost exclusively associated with computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  Strong mathematical aptitude is common and often necessary in computer science. 
* **Lack of interest in drawing/writing:** While not universal, this combination is less typical of humanities professors, who often engage heavily with written and visual expression.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bias:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this relies on stereotypes. There are certainly humanities professors who code and computer science professors who are talented artists. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  100 professors is not a huge sample, making broad generalizations less reliable.

**The high probability (0.9) reflects the strong indicators, but it's not absolute certainty.**
