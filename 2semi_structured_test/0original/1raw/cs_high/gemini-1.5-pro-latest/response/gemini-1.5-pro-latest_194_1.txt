{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct evidence of Jason's profession, several cues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals in general, but particularly in competitive fields like computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While this doesn't exclude him from humanities, it further leans towards a field where these skills might be less central.

Considering these factors, and given the higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75%), a probability of 0.9 seems reasonable. However, it's crucial to remember this is still an estimation based on limited information.
