{"probability": "0.75"}

**Reasoning:**

The prompt states that 75 out of the 100 professors in the study were computer science professors. This means there's a baseline 75% chance that any randomly selected professor from this group would be a computer science professor.

While the description provides some details about Jason, it doesn't offer strong evidence to shift the probability significantly away from the baseline.  

Here's why:

* **Traits not exclusive:**  While enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles might be more common among computer science professors, these traits are not exclusive to that field. Humanities professors can also engage in logical thinking and problem-solving. 
* **Creative but not artistic:** The description highlights Jason's creativity but also mentions he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing. This could be interpreted as slightly more indicative of a computer science leaning, but it's not definitive.

**Conclusion:**

Without strong evidence pushing us towards either field, the most logical probability remains close to the initial proportion of computer science professors in the study.
