{"probability": "0.9"} 

My reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** Starting with a base rate, there's a higher chance (75%) that Jason is a computer science professor due to the larger sample size from that field. 
* **Personality Description:** The description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles.
    * While creative, dislikes drawing and writing, which are less central to computer science.
* **Lack of Strong Humanities Indicators:** The description lacks strong indicators that would point towards a humanities field (e.g., passion for literature, history, philosophy).

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes and limited information. It's important to acknowledge that personality descriptions are not foolproof indicators of profession.
