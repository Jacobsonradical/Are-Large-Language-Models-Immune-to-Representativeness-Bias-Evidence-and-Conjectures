{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more common in the stereotype of a computer scientist.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Small Sample Size:**  100 professors is not a huge sample, making broad generalizations less reliable. 
* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies partly on stereotypes about computer scientists and humanities professors.  These stereotypes may not accurately reflect reality.
* **Individual Variation:**  Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and many computer scientists are artistic. 

**Therefore, while a high probability is assigned, it's crucial to remember this is based on limited information and potential biases.**
