{"probability": "0.90"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:**  These are strong indicators of an affinity for computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** While applicable to both fields, these traits are often associated with success in the highly competitive field of computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This makes it less likely he's in a humanities field, where these skills are often valued.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Base Rate:** The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This significantly influences the probability.
* **Stereotyping:** It's crucial to avoid relying solely on stereotypes. While the description aligns with common perceptions of computer science professors, there's always variation within any profession.

**Disclaimer:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's no guarantee Jason is a computer science professor.
