{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  "Coding" and "solving mathematical puzzles" are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Creative, but...:** The statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing" further points away from humanities fields, which often involve those skills.

**Important Note:** This is based on probability and stereotypes. There are certainly creative and ambitious humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles, and some computer science professors might enjoy artistic pursuits. However, based on the given information and common associations, a higher probability lies with Jason being a computer science professor.
