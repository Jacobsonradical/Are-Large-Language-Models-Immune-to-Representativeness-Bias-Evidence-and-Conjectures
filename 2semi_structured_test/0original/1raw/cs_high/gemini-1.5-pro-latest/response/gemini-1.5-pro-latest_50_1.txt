{"probability": "0.9"} 

Here's why I give a high probability:

* **Stereotypical Interests:** Jason's enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing align strongly with common stereotypes of computer science professionals. 
* **Sample Size:** While the description leans towards a computer science profile, it's important to remember there are 3 times as many computer science professors in the study. This significantly influences the probability.

**Important Note:** This response relies heavily on stereotypes.  It's crucial to avoid applying such generalizations in real-world scenarios where individual differences are paramount.
