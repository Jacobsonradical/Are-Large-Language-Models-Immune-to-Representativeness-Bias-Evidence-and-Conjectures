{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the detail-oriented nature of programming and computer science research.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:**  This makes it slightly less likely he's in the humanities, where these skills are often valued.

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. There are certainly creative and ambitious people in the humanities who might fit this description, and not all computer scientists fit this mold.
