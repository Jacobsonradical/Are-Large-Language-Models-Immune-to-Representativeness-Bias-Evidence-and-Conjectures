{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it heavily implies a proclivity towards analytical and logical thinking, traits often associated with computer science:

* **"Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles"**: These are core activities within computer science.
* **"Conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious"**: While these traits can be found in various professions, they align well with the stereotypical image of a successful computer scientist. 
* **"Does not enjoy drawing or writing"**: This suggests a preference for technical and less artistic pursuits. 

It's important to acknowledge that this is still a probabilistic judgment. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and coding as hobbies. However, the provided information significantly increases the likelihood of him being a computer science professor given the study's focus on successful academics in these specific fields.
