{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common in many successful professionals, but the combination with the previous point makes a stronger case.
* **Dislike of drawing and writing:** While not universal, computer science careers often involve less emphasis on these skills compared to humanities.

It's important to remember this is a probability, not a certainty. There could be humanities professors who fit Jason's description, but the evidence points towards a higher likelihood of him being in computer science given the provided information.
