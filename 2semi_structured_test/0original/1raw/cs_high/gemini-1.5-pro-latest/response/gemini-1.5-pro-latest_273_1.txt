{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, can be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of the field.

The description lacks strong indicators of humanities interests. While Jason is creative, his disinterest in drawing and writing makes it somewhat less likely he's in a humanities field where those skills are often valued. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  It's impossible to be certain about Jason's profession based solely on this description.
