{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science and highly suggestive of the field. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more common in the stereotype of a computer science professor. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** While not definitive, this suggests less inclination towards humanities-focused activities.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid strong biases. The information provided relies partly on stereotypes. Many computer scientists are artistic, and many humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles.  A 0.9 probability acknowledges this uncertainty while still reflecting the stronger likelihood based on the given information.
