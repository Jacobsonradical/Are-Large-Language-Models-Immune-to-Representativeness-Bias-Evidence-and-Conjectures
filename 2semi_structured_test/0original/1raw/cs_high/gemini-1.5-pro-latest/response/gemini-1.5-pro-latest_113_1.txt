{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides some information that might be stereotypically associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), the most compelling evidence is the statement "Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing." This suggests a preference for logical and analytical pursuits over more artistic or expressive ones, which aligns more strongly with the field of computer science.

However, it's important to note that this is still a probabilistic judgment. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with specific interests and skills in areas like digital humanities or computational linguistics. The provided probability of 0.9 reflects a high likelihood but acknowledges this remaining uncertainty.
