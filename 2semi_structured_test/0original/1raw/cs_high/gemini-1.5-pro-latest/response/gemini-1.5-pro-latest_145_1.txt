{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mindset, common in computer science.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:**  This suggests creativity expressed through technical means rather than artistic ones.

While someone in the humanities *could* possess these traits, they are more typical of a computer science professor.  Therefore, the probability is high, but not absolute (hence, not 1.0).
