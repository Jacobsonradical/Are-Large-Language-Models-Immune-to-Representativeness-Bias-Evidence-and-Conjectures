{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know based on a personality sketch, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided and common stereotypes:

* **Prior Probability:** The study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a base 75% chance a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
* **Stereotype Matching:**  The description aligns with some stereotypes of computer scientists:  enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles, and a preference for logic-based tasks over artistic ones (despite being creative).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes are not always accurate.** Many computer scientists enjoy artistic pursuits, and many humanities scholars are very analytical. 
* **Limited Information:** The personality sketch is brief and might not capture the full complexity of Jason's interests and skills.

**Therefore, while not definitive, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems like a reasonable estimate given the available information.**
