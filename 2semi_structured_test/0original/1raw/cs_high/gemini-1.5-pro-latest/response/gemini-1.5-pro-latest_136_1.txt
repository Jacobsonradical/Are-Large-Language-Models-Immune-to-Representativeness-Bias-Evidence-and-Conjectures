{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more common in the structured world of computer science compared to some humanities disciplines.

It's important to acknowledge that this is still just a probability.  The information provided doesn't rule out Jason being a humanities professor with atypical interests.
