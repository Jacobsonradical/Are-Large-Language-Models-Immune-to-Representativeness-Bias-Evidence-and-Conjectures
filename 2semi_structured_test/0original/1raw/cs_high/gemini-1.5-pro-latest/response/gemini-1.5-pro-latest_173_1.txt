{"probability": "0.75"} 

**Explanation:**

While the description offers some clues, we must rely on the base rates provided in the study to give the most accurate probability. Here's why:

* **Base Rate:** The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This means there's a 3:1 ratio, or a 75% chance, that any randomly selected professor from this study is in computer science. 
* **Description Clues:**  The description does lean towards a computer science stereotype (coding, math puzzles). However, these are not exclusive to computer science; humanities professors can enjoy logic puzzles or even dabble in coding.  
* **Avoiding Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid letting the description completely overshadow the base rate. While Jason *sounds* like a computer scientist, the numbers tell us it's still more likely he's from the larger group of computer science professors in the study.
