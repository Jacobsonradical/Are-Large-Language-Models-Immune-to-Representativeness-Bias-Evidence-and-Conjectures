{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science.
* **Highly creative but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests his creativity is channeled into more technical or logical fields, again aligning with computer science. 

It's important to note that this is a probabilistic judgment based on stereotypes.  There are certainly creative and ambitious humanities professors who might fit this description. However, given the information, it's more likely Jason belongs to the larger computer science group in the study.
