{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns strongly with skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Personality:** The description highlights traits like being "careful" and "talented," which could apply to both fields but are often associated with the detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:**  The statement that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, while not excluding him from humanities, further weakens the association.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bias:** It's crucial to acknowledge that this assessment is based on stereotypes. There are many successful humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles or coding, and not all computer scientists fit this description.
* **Limited Information:**  The description offers a small glimpse into Jason's personality.  More information about his research, teaching style, and other interests would lead to a more informed probability.
