{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:**  These traits, while not exclusive to one field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing, while potentially fitting a computer science stereotype, is not a strong indicator by itself.  

**Important Note:** My probability is high but not absolute. There are certainly creative and technically-minded individuals in the humanities. The description provides a limited snapshot of Jason's personality, and individual variations within professions always exist.
