{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests highly aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more common in the structured world of computer science. 
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** This suggests a preference for more logic-based activities over creative or artistic expression, again leaning towards a computer science profile.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors excel in logic and many computer scientists are highly creative. However, based on the provided information and common trends, the probability leans heavily towards Jason being a computer science professor.
