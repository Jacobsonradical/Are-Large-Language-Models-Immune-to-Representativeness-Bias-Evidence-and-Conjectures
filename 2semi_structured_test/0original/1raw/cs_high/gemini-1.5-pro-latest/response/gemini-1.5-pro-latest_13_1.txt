{"probability": "0.9"}

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are highly aligned with computer science. While some humanities fields use math, coding is far more central to computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these, the phrasing suggests a preference against activities core to many humanities disciplines. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability, not a certainty. The information provided leans heavily towards computer science, but there's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
