{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators aligning with computer science. These are core activities within the field.
* **Personality:**  While "conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, they are often associated with the detail-oriented and logical thinking prevalent in computer science.
* **Lack of Artistic Interest:** The statement that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, while creative, suggests a preference for logic and systems over artistic expression, again leaning towards computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with a passion for logic puzzles and coding as a hobby. However, the evidence strongly suggests he's more likely in the computer science group.
