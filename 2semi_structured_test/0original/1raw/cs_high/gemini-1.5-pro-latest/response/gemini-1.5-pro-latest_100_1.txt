{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with the skills and interests of computer scientists. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals in general, but the specific combination with the previous point leans towards computer science.

The description does mention Jason being highly creative but disliking drawing or writing. This might seem to point away from computer science, but:

* **Creativity is valuable in both fields:** Computer science often requires creative problem-solving and innovative thinking.
* **Disliking drawing/writing is not exclusive:**  Many people, including those in technical fields, don't enjoy these activities.

**Important Note:** My answer is a high probability, not absolute certainty. There's a small chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong affinity for logic and problem-solving, potentially in a field like philosophy or linguistics.
