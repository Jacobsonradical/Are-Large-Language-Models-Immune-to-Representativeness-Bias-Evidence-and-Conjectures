{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with interests common in computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are found across both fields, so they are less informative.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could be found in either field and are not strong indicators either way. 
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While this might suggest a leaning away from humanities, it's not a definitive marker.

**Important Note:** The probability is high but not absolute (1.0).  There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. The provided information leans heavily towards computer science due to the strong correlation of his hobbies with the field.
