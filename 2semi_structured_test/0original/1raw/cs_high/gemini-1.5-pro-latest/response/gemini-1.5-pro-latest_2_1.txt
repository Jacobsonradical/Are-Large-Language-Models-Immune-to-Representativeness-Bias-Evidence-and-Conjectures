{"probability": "0.85"} 

**Reasoning:**

While there's no foolproof way to know for sure without seeing the other descriptions, the information provided leans towards Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong STEM indicators:** Enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and being highly creative are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, often associated with STEM fields, particularly computer science.
* **Lack of Arts indicators:**  While not definitive, the statement "he does not enjoy drawing or writing" might suggest a lesser inclination towards humanities.

**Important Note:**  This is a probability based on limited information.  Personality profiles are not perfect predictors of profession. There could be humanities professors who share Jason's traits, and vice versa.
