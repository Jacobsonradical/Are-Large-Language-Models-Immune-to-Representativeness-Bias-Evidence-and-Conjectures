{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These activities are highly aligned with the skills and interests of computer science professionals. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, can be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Highly Creative (but dislikes drawing/writing):** This suggests a specific type of creativity that might manifest in problem-solving or technical innovation, areas common in computer science.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors could also enjoy coding or have similar personality traits.  My answer is based on probability, acknowledging that there's a chance Jason could be in the humanities.
