{"probability": "0.8"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans towards Jason being a computer science professor due to these points:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities strongly associated with computer science. 
* **Talented and ambitious:** These traits are common among successful professionals, including academics in both fields.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits could apply to either field, but there's a stereotype (not necessarily accurate) of computer scientists being more conservative.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This might suggest a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits, again aligning somewhat with stereotypes of computer science. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There's a good chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a passion for logic and problem-solving expressed through his field.  Without more information about the base rates of these traits in each professor group, it's impossible to be certain.
