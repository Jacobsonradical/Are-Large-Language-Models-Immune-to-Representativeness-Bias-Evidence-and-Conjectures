{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science. 
* **Talent and ambition:** These traits are important for success in any academic field, but perhaps even more so in the competitive and rapidly evolving field of computer science.

The fact that Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing might be seen as slightly pointing away from humanities, but it's not a strong enough indicator to outweigh the other points.

**Important Note:** This is still just a probability based on limited information. There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with a strong aptitude and interest in logic and problem-solving.
