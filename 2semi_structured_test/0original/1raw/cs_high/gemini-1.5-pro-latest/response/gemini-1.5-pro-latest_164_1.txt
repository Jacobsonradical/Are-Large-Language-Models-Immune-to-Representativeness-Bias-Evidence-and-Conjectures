{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several cues strongly suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a core skill in computer science and uncommon in most humanities disciplines.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  A strong affinity for logic and problem-solving aligns more with computer science. 
* **Not enjoying drawing or writing:**  While some in the humanities might not enjoy these either, they are less central to the field than in the past.  

**Important Note:**  This is based on stereotypes and probabilities. There are certainly creative and talented individuals within the humanities who enjoy coding and math puzzles.  Without more information, a high probability based on limited data is the best we can offer.
