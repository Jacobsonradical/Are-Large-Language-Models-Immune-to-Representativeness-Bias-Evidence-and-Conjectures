{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with computer science interests.
* **Highly Creative:**  Creativity is essential in both fields, but the specific mention of not enjoying drawing or writing might suggest his creative outlets lean towards more technical avenues.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  There are undoubtedly humanities professors who love coding and math puzzles, just as some computer science professors enjoy art and writing.  However, based on the provided information and the higher likelihood of the described traits appearing in a computer science professor, a probability of 0.9 seems reasonable.
