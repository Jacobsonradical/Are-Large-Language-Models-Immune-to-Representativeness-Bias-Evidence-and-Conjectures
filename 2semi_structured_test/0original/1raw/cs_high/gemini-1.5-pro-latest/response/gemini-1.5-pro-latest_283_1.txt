{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with the skills and interests commonly associated with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more prevalent in fields emphasizing structured thinking and precision, like computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:**  While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the lack of interest might suggest a preference for the more technical and less interpretive aspects of computer science compared to humanities.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic assessment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. There are many creative and successful individuals in both computer science and humanities who defy these common assumptions.
