{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While we don't have concrete data on personality distributions between the two professor groups, the description leans heavily towards stereotypes associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an affinity towards computer science.
* **Does not enjoy drawing or writing:** While not definitive, this might suggest less inclination towards humanities fields often associated with these activities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Stereotypes:** My reasoning relies on common stereotypes.  It's entirely possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding or dislike writing, and vice-versa for computer science professors. 
* **Small Sample Size:** 100 professors is a relatively small sample.  Strong conclusions about personality traits and career choices can't be definitively drawn from this alone.

**Therefore, while my probability is high, it's essential to remember this is an educated guess based on limited information.**
