{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science. 
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while found in both fields, might be slightly more common in the structured world of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** This suggests a preference for technical over artistic expression, again slightly more typical in computer science.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a probabilistic judgment, not a certainty. There are certainly creative and meticulous people in the humanities, and some computer scientists enjoy art.
* The sample size is relatively small, which limits the strength of any conclusion.

Therefore, while not impossible that Jason is a humanities professor, a probability of 0.9 reflects the evidence pointing towards computer science.
