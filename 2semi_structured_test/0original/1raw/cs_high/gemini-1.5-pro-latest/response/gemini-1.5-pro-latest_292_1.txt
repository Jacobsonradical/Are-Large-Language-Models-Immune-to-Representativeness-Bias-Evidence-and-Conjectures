{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of an analytical and logical mind, common in computer science. 
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** While not all computer scientists dislike these activities, they are less central to the field compared to humanities.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sample Size:**  The study has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25). This significantly influences the probability.
* **Stereotypes:** It's crucial to avoid strict stereotypes.  Some humanities professors might enjoy coding, and some computer science professors might be talented writers.

**Conclusion:**

While not certain, based on the available information and the higher representation of computer science professors in the study, there's a high probability Jason belongs to that group.
