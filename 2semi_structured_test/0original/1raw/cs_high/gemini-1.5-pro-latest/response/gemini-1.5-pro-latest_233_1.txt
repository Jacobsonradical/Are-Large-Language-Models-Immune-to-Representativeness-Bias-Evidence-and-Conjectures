{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  Explicitly mentioned, a strong indicator of computer science.
* **Mathematical Puzzles:**  A common interest among those in computer science and related fields.
* **Conservative, Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:**  While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, the lack of interest might suggest a preference for the more technical side.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.  A true probability calculation would require a deeper analysis of the entire dataset and the prevalence of these traits in both groups.
