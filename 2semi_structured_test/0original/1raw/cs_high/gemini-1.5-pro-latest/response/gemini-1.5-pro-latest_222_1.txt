{"probability": "0.95"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, it heavily implies a strong STEM inclination:

* **Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are strong indicators of a computer science background. 
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing/writing:** This suggests his creativity manifests in logical/analytical ways, aligning more with computer science than traditional humanities.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description fits a common image of a computer scientist, there are many creative and humanities-oriented individuals within that field.  My high probability is based on the provided information and the higher base rate of computer science professors in the study (75 vs. 25).
