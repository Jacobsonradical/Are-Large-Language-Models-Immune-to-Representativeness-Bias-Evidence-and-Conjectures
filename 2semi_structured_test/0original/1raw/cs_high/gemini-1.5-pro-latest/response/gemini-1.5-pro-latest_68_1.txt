{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Interests:** Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing/writing strongly align with stereotypes and common interests within the computer science field.
* **Traits:** "Conservative" and "careful" could apply to either field, but the combination of "talented" and "ambitious" might be slightly more stereotypical (though not definitively) of those in computer science.

**Important Note:** This is a probability based on limited information and potential biases.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests. A more definitive answer would require access to his actual personality test results and a deeper understanding of the traits common to successful academics in both fields.
