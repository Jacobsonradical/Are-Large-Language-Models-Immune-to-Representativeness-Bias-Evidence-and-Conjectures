{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests a higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Strong Alignment with Computer Science Stereotypes:** The description emphasizes traits often associated with computer scientists:
    * Enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles.
    * Logical and analytical (implied by "careful").
* **Lack of Fit with Humanities Stereotypes:** 
    * Dislikes drawing and writing, activities often associated with humanities fields.

**Important Notes:**

* **Stereotypes are not absolute:**  It's crucial to remember that these are just tendencies and not guaranteed predictors. Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles, and some computer scientists are talented artists.
* **Limited Information:**  The description provides a very limited snapshot of Jason's personality. Other factors, such as his research interests and teaching style, would be much more informative.

**Therefore, while a probability of 0.9 indicates a strong likelihood, it's not a certainty. **
