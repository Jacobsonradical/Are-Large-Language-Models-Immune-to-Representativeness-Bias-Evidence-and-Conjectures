{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:** Coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a disinterest in drawing/writing strongly align with typical interests of computer science professionals. 
* **Personality:** Being "conservative" and "careful" could be seen as fitting with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Ambition:** While present in both fields, ambition is often a strong driver in the competitive field of computer science.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are certainly creative and artistic computer scientists, just as there are humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles.  The provided information simply makes it statistically more probable that Jason belongs to the larger computer science group in this specific study.
