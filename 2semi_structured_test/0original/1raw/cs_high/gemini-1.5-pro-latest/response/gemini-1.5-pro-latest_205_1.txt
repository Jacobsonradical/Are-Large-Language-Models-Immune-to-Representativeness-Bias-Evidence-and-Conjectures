{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, can be associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of the field.
* **Lack of Enjoyment for Drawing and Writing:**  While some computer scientists enjoy these activities, they are less central to the field compared to the humanities.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. Many humanities professors might enjoy coding, and many computer science professors are artistic.  This response is based on probability due to the clues presented and the higher prevalence of computer science professors in the sample (75 vs. 25).
