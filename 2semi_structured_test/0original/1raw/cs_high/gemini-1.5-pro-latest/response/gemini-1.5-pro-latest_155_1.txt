{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues point towards a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding:**  Explicitly mentioning coding strongly suggests a computer science background. This is a core skill in the field and less common in the humanities.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  An enjoyment of mathematical puzzles also aligns more with computer science, which often involves algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.
* **Lack of interest in drawing/writing:** While not definitive,  humanities professors often engage with writing and potentially drawing (depending on their specific field).  The lack of enjoyment in these areas, coupled with other points, weakens the case for humanities.

**Important Note:**  My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., "1.0"). It's possible for someone in the humanities to have these traits. The description provides a limited snapshot, and people are diverse.
