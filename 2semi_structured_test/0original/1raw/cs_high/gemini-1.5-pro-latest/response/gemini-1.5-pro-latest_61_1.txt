{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** This contrasts with typical interests within the humanities, which often value creative writing and visual arts.

**Important Note:** My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., "1.0"). It's possible for humanities professors to enjoy coding or for computer scientists to be artistic. The description leans heavily towards a computer science profile based on common stereotypes and probabilities.
