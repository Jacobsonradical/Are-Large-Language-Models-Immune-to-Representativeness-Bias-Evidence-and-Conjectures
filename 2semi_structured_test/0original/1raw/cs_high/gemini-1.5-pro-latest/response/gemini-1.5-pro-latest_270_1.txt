{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description provides no direct information about Jason's profession, it offers strong clues that point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities heavily associated with computer science and less so with humanities.
* **Highly creative, but dislikes drawing or writing:** This suggests creativity channeled into a field that doesn't rely heavily on those artistic expressions, aligning with computer science. 

It's important to consider the base rate: 75 out of 100 professors in the study are from computer science.  This prior probability significantly influences our final estimate.

While Jason's description doesn't definitively confirm his profession, the clues strongly suggest computer science. My probability estimate of 0.9 reflects this high likelihood, acknowledging a small chance he could be a humanities professor with an unusual hobby combination.
