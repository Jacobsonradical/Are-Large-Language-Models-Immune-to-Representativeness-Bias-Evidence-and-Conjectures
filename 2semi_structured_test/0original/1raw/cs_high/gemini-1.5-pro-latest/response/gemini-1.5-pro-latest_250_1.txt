**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description leans heavily towards traits often associated with computer science:

* **Coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are core activities within computer science.
* **Conservative and careful:** These traits can be advantageous in fields requiring precision and logical thinking. 
* **Dislike of drawing and writing:** While some computer scientists enjoy these, the description contrasts Jason's creativity with a lack of interest in more artistic endeavors.

**It's crucial to note:**  Personality stereotypes are unreliable. This answer is based on probability given limited information and common biases, not a guaranteed prediction of Jason's profession.
