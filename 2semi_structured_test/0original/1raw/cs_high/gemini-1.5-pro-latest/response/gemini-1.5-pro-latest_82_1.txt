{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators of skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, might be slightly more associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might suggest a preference for more technical fields, but it's not as strong an indicator as the other factors. 

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on limited information. It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. There are plenty of humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and coding, and many computer science professors are artistic!
