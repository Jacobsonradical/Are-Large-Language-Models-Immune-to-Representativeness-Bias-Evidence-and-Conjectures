{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several clues make it more likely he's a computer science professor:

* **Coding:** This is a strong indicator aligned with computer science.
* **Mathematical puzzles:**  A preference for logic and problem-solving is common in computer science.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing/writing:** While not impossible for a humanities professor, it's less typical. Humanities often involve creative writing and visual analysis.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's still a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. The higher base rate of computer science professors (75 vs. 25) also influences the probability.
