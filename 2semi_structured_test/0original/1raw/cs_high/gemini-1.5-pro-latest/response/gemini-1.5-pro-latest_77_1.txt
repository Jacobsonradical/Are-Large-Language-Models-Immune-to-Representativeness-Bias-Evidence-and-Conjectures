{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science.
* **Talent and ambition:** These traits are common among successful individuals in many fields, but combined with the previous point, they further support the likelihood of him being in computer science.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:**  While not impossible for a humanities professor, these activities are less central to their work compared to computer science.

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information.  There's a chance Jason is a humanities professor with atypical interests, or the study might have sampling biases.
