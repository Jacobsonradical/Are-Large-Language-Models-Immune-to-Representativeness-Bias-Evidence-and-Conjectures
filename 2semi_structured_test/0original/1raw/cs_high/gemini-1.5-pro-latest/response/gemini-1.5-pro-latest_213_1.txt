{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest he's more likely a computer science professor:

* **Enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles:** These are highly aligned with skills and interests common in computer science.
* **Talent and ambition:** These traits are found in successful individuals across fields, so they are less informative.
* **Lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing:** While not all computer scientists dislike these, they are less central to the field compared to humanities.

**Important Note:** My probability is high but not absolute (e.g., 1.0). There's always a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests. The information provided paints a probable picture but isn't conclusive.
