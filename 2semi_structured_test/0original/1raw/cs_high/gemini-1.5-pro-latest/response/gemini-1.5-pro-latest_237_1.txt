{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description heavily suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are strong indicators aligning with the skills and interests of a computer science professor.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, could be associated with the logical and structured thinking often found in computer science.
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing and Writing:** This further distinguishes him from a humanities professor, where these skills are often more central.

It's important to remember that this is based on stereotypes and probabilities. There are certainly creative and ambitious individuals in the humanities who dislike drawing and writing, just as there are computer science professors who enjoy those activities. However, based on the given information and common perceptions, a higher probability leans towards Jason being a computer science professor.
