{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Here's why:

* **Interests:**  Coding, mathematical puzzles, and a talent for problem-solving are strong indicators of an inclination towards computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest:** While not all computer scientists enjoy drawing or writing, the fact that he dislikes them despite being creative leans away from humanities fields which often value these skills.
* **Base Rate:**  The sample has 3 times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25).  This prior probability significantly influences the likelihood.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information. There is a chance Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
