{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While not definitive, several clues strongly suggest Jason is more likely a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:** These are core activities in computer science, making them highly indicative of the field.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science, are often associated with methodical and detail-oriented professions, which aligns with computer science. 
* **Lack of Interest in Drawing/Writing:** While some computer scientists may enjoy these, the description actively points out a lack of interest, which might contrast with the creative writing/analysis often found in humanities.

**Important Note:** This is still a probability, not a certainty. There are talented and ambitious individuals in both fields. The description lacks information about Jason's specific research, teaching style, or other strong indicators that would solidify his field.
