{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators point towards computer science:

* **Enjoys coding:** This is a highly specific skill directly relevant to computer science.
* **Solving mathematical puzzles:**  Strong mathematical aptitude is common and often necessary in computer science.
* **Conservative, careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to computer science,  align with stereotypes of the field that emphasize precision and logical thinking. 

The lack of interest in drawing or writing might be seen as a slight counterpoint. However, the strong positive indicators for computer science outweigh this. 

**Important Note:**  This is a probabilistic judgment based on limited information and potential stereotypes. It's crucial to avoid using such judgments to make assumptions about individuals in real-life scenarios.
