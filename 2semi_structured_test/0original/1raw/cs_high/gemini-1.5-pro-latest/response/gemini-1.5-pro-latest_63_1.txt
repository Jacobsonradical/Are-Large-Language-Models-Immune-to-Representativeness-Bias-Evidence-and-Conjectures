{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, several strong indicators suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Coding and Mathematical Puzzles:**  These are highly aligned with computer science interests.
* **Conservative and Careful:** These traits, while not exclusive to any field, are often associated with the structured and detail-oriented nature of computer science.

The lack of interest in drawing and writing might be seen as mildly supporting the computer science lean, but it's not as strong an indicator as the other factors. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes.  Plenty of humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles or even dabble in coding. This response is based on probabilities derived from common trends, not absolute assumptions.
