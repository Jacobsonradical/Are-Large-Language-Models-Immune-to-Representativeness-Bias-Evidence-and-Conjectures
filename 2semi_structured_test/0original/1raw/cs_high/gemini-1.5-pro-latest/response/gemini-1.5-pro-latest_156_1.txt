{"probability": "0.9"} 

**Reasoning:**

While the description doesn't definitively place Jason in either field, the following points strongly suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

* **Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles:** These are activities highly aligned with computer science. 
* **Talented:**  The description highlights talent, which might be relevant to technical fields like computer science.
* **Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing:** This suggests a preference for more technical and less artistic pursuits, which might be less common in humanities fields.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to avoid stereotypes. While the description leans towards a computer science profile, there could be humanities professors who share these traits. This estimation is based on probabilities and common trends, not absolute certainty.
