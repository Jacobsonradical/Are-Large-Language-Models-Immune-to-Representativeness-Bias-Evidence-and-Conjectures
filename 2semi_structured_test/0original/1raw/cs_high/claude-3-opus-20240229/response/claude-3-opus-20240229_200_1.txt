Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves logical problem solving and programming.

However, without more details on the specific personality traits the study found most correlated with each group, and the relative proportions of those traits in the description, I cannot give a definitive probability. The 0.75 estimate reflects the description seeming to align more with a stereotypical computer science professor profile, while acknowledging the significant uncertainty involved.
