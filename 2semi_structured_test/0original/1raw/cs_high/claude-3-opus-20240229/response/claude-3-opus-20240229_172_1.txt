Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science than humanities. 

However, without more detailed information on the specific distribution of traits among the two groups of professors in the study, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The 75% probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood based on the description, while acknowledging it is not a certainty given the limited data available.
