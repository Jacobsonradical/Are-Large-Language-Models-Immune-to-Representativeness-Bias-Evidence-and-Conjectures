Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more consistent with stereotypical traits of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, without more detailed data on the actual distribution of these traits among the professors in the sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The probability I gave reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given the description, but acknowledges the lack of complete certainty.
