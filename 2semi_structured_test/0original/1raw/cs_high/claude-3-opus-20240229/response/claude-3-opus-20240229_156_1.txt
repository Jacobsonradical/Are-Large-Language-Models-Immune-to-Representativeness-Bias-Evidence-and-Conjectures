Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem more aligned with a typical profile of a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as the fact that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing despite being creative, suggest a leaning towards computer science. That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who share some of these traits and interests. Weighing the available evidence, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.7"}
