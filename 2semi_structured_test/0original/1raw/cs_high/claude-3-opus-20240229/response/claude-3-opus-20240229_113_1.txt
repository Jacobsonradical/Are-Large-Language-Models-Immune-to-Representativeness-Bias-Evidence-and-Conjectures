Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say conclusively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 

- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, creative outlets more commonly associated with the humanities.

- The sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so selecting a computer science professor at random is more probable.

Without more definitive information though, significant uncertainty remains. As a rough estimate, I'd say there is a 65-75% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description and sample composition.
