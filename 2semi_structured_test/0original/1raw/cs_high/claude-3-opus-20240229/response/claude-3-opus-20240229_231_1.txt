Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without more specific information, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonable guess given the details provided, but acknowledges that additional data points would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
