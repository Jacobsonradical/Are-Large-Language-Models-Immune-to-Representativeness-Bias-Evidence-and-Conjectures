Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, traits often associated with computer science, and his lack of interest in drawing and writing, more commonly associated with the humanities, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This is a rough estimate, as individual traits and interests can vary widely within professions. More detailed information about Jason's academic background, research focus, and professional achievements would help provide a more accurate assessment.
