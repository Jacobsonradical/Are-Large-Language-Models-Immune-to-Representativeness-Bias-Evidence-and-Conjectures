Based on the given description, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he is more likely to be in computer science than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample group, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

While the description provides some indications, there isn't enough definitive information to be certain of Jason's field. The probability estimate reflects the limited information available.
