Based on the limited information provided in the description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 

2. His hobbies do not include drawing or writing, which are more common in the humanities.

3. Traits like being careful and ambitious could apply to successful academics in both fields.

4. The sample included 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors. Without additional distinguishing information, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, this is a rough estimate based on stereotypical associations and the limited data provided. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, academic background, and personality would be needed to make a more confident determination.
