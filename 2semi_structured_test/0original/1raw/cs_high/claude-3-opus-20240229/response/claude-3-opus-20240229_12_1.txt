Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, also suggests a leaning towards computer science over the humanities.

3. The description doesn't give any strong indication of humanities-related interests or activities.

However, I acknowledge there is still uncertainty in this estimate, as the description is brief and does not provide a comprehensive view of Jason's personality and interests. The base rates of the study population (75% computer science, 25% humanities) would also influence the probability estimate, but were not factored in here due to the instructions to base the estimate on the specific description provided.
