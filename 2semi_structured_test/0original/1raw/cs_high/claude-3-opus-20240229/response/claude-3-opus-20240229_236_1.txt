Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than the humanities. His enjoyment of coding and math combined with a lack of interest in drawing and writing point more toward a computer science specialization.

However, without more details on the specific personality traits the study found common among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The 75/25 split of the sample also needs to be considered probabilistically. So while Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor than humanities based on the description, I don't think we can say it's a near certainty without additional information.
