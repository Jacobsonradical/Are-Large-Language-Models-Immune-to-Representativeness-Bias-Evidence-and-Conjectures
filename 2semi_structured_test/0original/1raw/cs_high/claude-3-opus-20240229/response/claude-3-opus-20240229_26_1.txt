Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could point more toward technical/analytical creativity vs artistic 

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem largely unrelated to his field.

Given the information, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7, with the coding and math interest being the key distinguishing factors. But there's still a reasonable chance he could be a humanities professor.
