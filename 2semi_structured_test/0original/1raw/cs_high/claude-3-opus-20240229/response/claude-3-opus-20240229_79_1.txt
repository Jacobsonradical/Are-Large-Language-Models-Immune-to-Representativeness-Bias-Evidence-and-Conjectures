Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards quantitative rather than arts-oriented creativity.

That said, these are far from definitive indicators, and plenty of humanities professors may share those traits while computer science professors may not.

If I had to give a rough probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate with low confidence based on limited, stereotyped information. Many more details about his background, research focus, and personality would be needed to give a truly informed estimate. The study methodology also seems questionable in using a subjective panel assessment to determine personality traits.
