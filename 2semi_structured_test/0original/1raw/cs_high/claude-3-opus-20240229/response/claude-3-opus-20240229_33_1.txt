Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing my probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. His personality traits of being careful, talented, and ambitious align well with a successful career in computer science. 

3. The fact that he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity is more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits like computer science.

4. The study sample has a 3:1 ratio of computer science to humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not conclusively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The 0.15 probability allows for the small chance that his profile could fit a humanities professor who has some technical hobbies and inclinations.
