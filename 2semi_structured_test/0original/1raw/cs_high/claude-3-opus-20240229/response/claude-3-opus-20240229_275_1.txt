To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information in his description that aligns with traits more commonly associated with computer science or humanities professors.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more often associated with computer science.
- He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more aligned with computer science than humanities.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so without additional information, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75%.

Given the limited information favoring computer science, I would estimate the probability to be slightly higher than the prior probability.

{"probability": "0.80"}
