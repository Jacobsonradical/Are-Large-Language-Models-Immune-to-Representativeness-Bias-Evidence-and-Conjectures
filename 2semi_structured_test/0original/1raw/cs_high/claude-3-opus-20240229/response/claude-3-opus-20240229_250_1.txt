Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related STEM fields.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, could indicate his creativity is more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. 

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75 professors) compared to humanities (25 professors).

Without more definitive information it's impossible to give a precise probability. But weighing the above factors, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is around 70%:
