To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and how well the description matches the stereotypical traits of each group.

Prior probabilities:
- 75 out of 100 professors in the sample are computer science professors (P(CS) = 0.75)
- 25 out of 100 professors in the sample are humanities professors (P(H) = 0.25)

The description suggests that Jason:
1. Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
2. Does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.
3. Is highly creative, which could be associated with either field.

Based on the strong match between Jason's interests and the stereotypical traits of computer science professors, and the mismatch with the stereotypical traits of humanities professors, the description provides substantial evidence that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

However, we should be cautious not to overweight this evidence and completely ignore the base rates. Since computer science professors make up a large majority of the sample, even a description that is not highly diagnostic would still result in a relatively high probability of being a computer science professor.

Considering both the base rates and the evidence from the description, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.90.
