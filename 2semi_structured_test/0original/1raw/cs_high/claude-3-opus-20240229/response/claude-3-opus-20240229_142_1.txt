Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science than humanities.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Professors in both fields could certainly be conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, married with children, and enjoy jogging.

Given the base rates of 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors in the sample, and weighing the slight evidence pointing towards computer science, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.8.
