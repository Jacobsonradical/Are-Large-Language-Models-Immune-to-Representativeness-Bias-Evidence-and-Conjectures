Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing, while being ambitious and talented, seems more consistent with a stereotypical profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. 

However, this is a tentative probability estimate based on very limited data and relies on general stereotypes rather than robust statistical analysis. More detailed data on the specific traits of the computer science vs. humanities professors in the sample would be needed to give a more definitive probability estimate.
