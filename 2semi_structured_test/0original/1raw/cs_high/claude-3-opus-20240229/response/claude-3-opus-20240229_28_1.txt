Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, also points more towards computer science than the humanities.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher base rate probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a higher probability because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The personality traits and demographic information provided are not necessarily exclusive to computer science professors.
