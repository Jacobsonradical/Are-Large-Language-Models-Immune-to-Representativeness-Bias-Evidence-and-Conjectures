Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His personality is described as conservative, careful, and ambitious, traits which may be more common among STEM professors compared to humanities professors. 

3. While he is described as highly creative, his lack of interest in drawing and writing suggests his creativity may be more oriented towards technical and scientific pursuits.

4. The sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is an inherent 75% prior probability he is a computer science professor.

However, I acknowledge significant uncertainty in this estimate, as an individual's hobbies and personality traits are not necessarily determinative of their academic field. More specific information about Jason's research focus and published work would allow for a more definitive classification.
