Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more data on the overall distribution of traits among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The 75% probability estimate reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a CS professor given his profile, but not a near certainty.
