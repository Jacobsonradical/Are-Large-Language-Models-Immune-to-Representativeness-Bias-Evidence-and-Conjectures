Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors leading to this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests he is more inclined towards technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones, which aligns with a computer science background.

3. The sample has a higher proportion of computer science professors (75%) compared to humanities professors (25%), so even without additional information, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not explicitly state Jason's profession, and there could be humanities professors with similar traits and interests.
