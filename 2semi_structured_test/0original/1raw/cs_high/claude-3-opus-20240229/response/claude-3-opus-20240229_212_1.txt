Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. The study sample includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a higher probability like 0.9 because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. There could be some humanities professors who fit this profile, even if it is less likely.
