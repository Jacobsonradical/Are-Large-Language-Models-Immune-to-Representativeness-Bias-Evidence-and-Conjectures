Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also fits the stereotype of a computer scientist more than a humanities professor.

However, without more detailed data on the specific traits and interests of computer science vs humanities professors in the sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The description alone is not definitive proof of Jason being a computer science professor.
