Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more humanities-oriented creative pursuits.

That said, these are only weak indicators based on stereotypes. Without more diagnostic information, the probability cannot be drastically skewed in either direction from the 75% base rate of CS professors in the sample.

My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.8"}
