Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor are:

1. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. His talent and ambition, which are important traits for success in a demanding field like computer science. 

3. The fact that he is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing. This suggests his creativity manifests more in technical or analytical domains rather than artistic ones, which fits the typical profile of a computer scientist.

4. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So even before considering Jason's specific traits, there is a 75% prior probability he is a computer science professor.

Of course, this is still just an estimated probability based on limited information. More details about Jason's educational background, research focus, and other factors would allow a more precise assessment. But given the description provided, I believe it is highly likely (probability around 0.85) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the study sample.
