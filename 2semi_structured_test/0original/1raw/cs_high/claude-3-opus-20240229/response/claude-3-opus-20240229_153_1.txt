Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly.

- The fact that he is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing seems more aligned with a computer science background. Creativity manifests in many ways, and creative problem solving is important in computer science.

- 75% of the sample were computer science professors, so all else being equal, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

That said, none of these factors are definitive. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy coding and math puzzles, and the other personality traits and biographical details provided don't clearly point to either field.

If I had to put a number on it based solely on the information given, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at around 0.6 to 0.7. But there's a lot of uncertainty around that estimate.
