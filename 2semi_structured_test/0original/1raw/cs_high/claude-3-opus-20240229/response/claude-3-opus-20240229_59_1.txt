Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more often found in the humanities.
- The sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so all else being equal, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence either way. Humanities professors can also enjoy coding and math, and not all computer scientists dislike writing and drawing. More information about Jason's specific research focus and academic background would help inform the probability assessment.

Taking into account the suggestive but not definitive evidence, as well as the base rates in the sample, I would estimate the probability as:

{"probability": "0.7"}
