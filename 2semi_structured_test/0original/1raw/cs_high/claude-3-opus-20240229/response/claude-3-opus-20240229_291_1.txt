Given the limited information provided, I'll make an educated guess based on the personality traits and interests mentioned:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of a computer science background.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait often associated with successful computer scientists.

3. Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for more technical and analytical activities.

However, without more detailed information about the distribution of these traits among the humanities professors, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate.
