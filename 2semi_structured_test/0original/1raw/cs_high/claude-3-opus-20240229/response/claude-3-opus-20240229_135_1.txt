Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related technical fields.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate more of a technical than artistic bent.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75%) compared to humanities (25%).

That said, these are stereotypical associations and there are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math and coding, and plenty of computer scientists with artistic interests. Conservative, careful, talented and ambitious individuals can be found in any field. 

Forced to give a probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough guess based on extremely limited information and stereotypical associations. Much more data about Jason's background, research focus, publication record, etc. would be needed to give a truly informed estimate of the probability he is a computer science vs. humanities professor. The study methodology also seems questionable in using personality tests to distinguish different types of professors.
