Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields more so than the humanities. 

- Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more commonly associated with the humanities.

- The sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so all else being equal, there's a 75% chance Jason would be a CS professor just based on the composition of the sample.

However, these are just broad generalizations and there is significant overlap in interests between fields. Many details like his marital status, political leanings, and exercise habits seem less relevant in distinguishing his likely field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on this description, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information and stereotypes. Many more personal details would be needed to make a truly informed estimate of the probability of his field. The study design and description provided are not sufficient to draw a reliable conclusion.
