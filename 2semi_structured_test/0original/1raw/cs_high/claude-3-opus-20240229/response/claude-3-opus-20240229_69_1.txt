Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. The sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being of a computer science professor. 

3. While Jason is described as highly creative, a trait that could be associated with either discipline, his dislike of drawing and writing seems to point more towards computer science.

However, I would caution that personality traits and hobbies are only weak predictors of academic discipline. More definitive information, like his specific research areas and publication record, would be needed to assign a probability with high confidence.
