Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he may be more inclined towards STEM fields than humanities. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering the description, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, I acknowledge there is still significant uncertainty in this estimate given the limited information. Personality traits and hobbies are not perfectly predictive of academic field. More details about his specific research focus, publications, and academic history would allow for a more definitive assessment.
