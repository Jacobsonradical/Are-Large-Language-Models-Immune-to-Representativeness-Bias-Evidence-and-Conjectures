To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in his description.

Relevant points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests he may be a computer science professor.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities professors.
3. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Given that Jason's interests align more closely with computer science and the sample contains more computer science professors than humanities professors, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
