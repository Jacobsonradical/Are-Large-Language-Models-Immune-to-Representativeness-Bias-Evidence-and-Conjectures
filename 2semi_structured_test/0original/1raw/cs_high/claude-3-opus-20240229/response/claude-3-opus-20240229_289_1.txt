Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more common for computer science than humanities, where writing would be more central

At the same time, the description is quite brief and lacks clear distinguishing details. Many of the other traits mentioned (being married with children, conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoying jogging) seem like they could apply equally to successful professors in either field.

Given the base rates of 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors in the sample, and weighing the suggestive but not definitive details in the description, I would estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor at around 80%:
