To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting he may not be as inclined towards humanities.
- The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher base rate of computer science professors.

Without additional information about the specific traits that distinguish computer science professors from humanities professors in this sample, we can base our estimate on the activities Jason enjoys and the base rates.

Given that coding and mathematical puzzles are more closely related to computer science, and considering the higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample, a reasonable estimate for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor might be around 0.8 (or 80%).
