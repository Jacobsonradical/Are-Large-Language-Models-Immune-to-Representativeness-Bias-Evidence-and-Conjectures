Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science than humanities.

At the same time, the description does not provide Jason's specific research areas, publications, or academic background that could more clearly identify his field. Other details like his age, marital status, and number of children seem less relevant in determining his academic discipline.

Given the need to provide a probability estimate despite the limited information, I would say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This reflects that the description leans more toward computer science overall, but there is still some uncertainty. More details about Jason's specific academic work and educational history would allow for a more definitive assessment.
