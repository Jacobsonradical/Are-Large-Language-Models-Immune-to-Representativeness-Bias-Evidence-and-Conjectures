To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we should consider the relevant information provided:

1. The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
3. Despite being highly creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more often associated with the humanities.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 0.75.

Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators that he is likely to be a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is less likely to be a humanities professor.

Considering the prior probability and the evidence from Jason's description, it is reasonable to assign a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

{"probability": "0.90"}
