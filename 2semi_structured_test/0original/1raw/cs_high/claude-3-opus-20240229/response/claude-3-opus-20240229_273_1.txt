To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided in his description.

Relevant information:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. There could be humanities professors who enjoy coding and math puzzles, and there could be computer science professors who enjoy drawing and writing.

Given the limited information, we can make an educated guess based on the stereotypical characteristics mentioned. Since the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, and Jason's interests align more with computer science, a reasonable probability estimate would be higher than the base rate of 75% for computer science professors in the sample.

{"probability": "0.85"}

This estimate is based on the given information, but it is important to note that individual characteristics can vary within each group, and stereotypes do not always accurately predict an individual's field of expertise.
