Here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key points that lead me to assign a high probability are:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer science professors.

- He is described as talented and ambitious, traits that tend to be associated with successful academics. 

- While highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more oriented to technical/mathematical domains rather than artistic ones, which fits the profile of a computer scientist.

- With 75% of the sample being computer science professors, that also increases the prior probability Jason belongs to that group vs. the humanities group.

Of course, this is not definitive as there could certainly be humanities professors fitting Jason's description. But given the limited information, I believe assigning a high probability of around 80% is reasonable. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further!
