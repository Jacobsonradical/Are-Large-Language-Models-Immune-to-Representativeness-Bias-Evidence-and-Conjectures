Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves coding, algorithms, and mathematical problem-solving.

However, without more information on the specific personality traits that are common among the two groups of professors, I cannot say with certainty that Jason is a computer science professor. The 75% probability reflects a reasonably strong likelihood based on the description provided, while acknowledging the uncertainty involved in making a definitive judgment from this limited data.
