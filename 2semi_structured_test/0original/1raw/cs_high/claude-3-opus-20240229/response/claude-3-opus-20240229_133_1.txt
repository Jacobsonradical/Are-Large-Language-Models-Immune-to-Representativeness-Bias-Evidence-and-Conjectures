Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, there is not enough definitive information to say with near certainty, so I estimate a 75% probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
