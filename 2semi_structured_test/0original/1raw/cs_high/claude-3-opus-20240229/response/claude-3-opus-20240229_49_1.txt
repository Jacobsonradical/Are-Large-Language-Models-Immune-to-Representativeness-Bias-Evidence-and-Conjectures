Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could hint more towards technical rather than artistic creativity

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem fairly neutral between the two fields.

Given the 75/25 split between CS and humanities professors in the sample, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of any randomly selected professor being in CS.

Considering the above points and base rate, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at around 80%:

{"probability": "0.80"}

But I want to caveat that this is a rough estimate based on very limited information and assumptions. Many more details would be needed to assess this with high confidence.
