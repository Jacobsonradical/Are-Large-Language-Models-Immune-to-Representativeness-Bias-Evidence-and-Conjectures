Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and math puzzles are stereotypically associated with computer science/STEM fields
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing seems more consistent with a technical rather than humanities field
- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75% computer science vs 25% humanities professors)

Without more information it's impossible to assign a precise probability. But weighing the available evidence, I estimate there is around a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor.
