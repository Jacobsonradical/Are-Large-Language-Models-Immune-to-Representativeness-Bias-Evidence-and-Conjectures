Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields more so than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment of drawing and writing, despite being creative, may also point more towards quantitative rather than humanities interests.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75%) compared to humanities (25%).

That said, these are broad generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile and computer science professors who do not. Conservatively estimating based on the limited evidence, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

That is, I believe there is roughly a 65% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided. But more details about his specific research focus, publications, and academic background would be needed to assess this with higher confidence. The description given does not conclusively identify his field.
