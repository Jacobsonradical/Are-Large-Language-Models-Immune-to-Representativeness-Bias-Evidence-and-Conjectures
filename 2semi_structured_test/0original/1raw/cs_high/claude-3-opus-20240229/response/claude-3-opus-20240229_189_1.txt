Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also seems more consistent with a computer science background.

However, there are certainly computer science professors who enjoy writing and drawing, and humanities professors who enjoy coding and math. The personality profile is quite limited to make a definitive judgment. Additionally, the base rates are relevant - 75% of the sample were computer science professors. So even if this profile were equally likely for both groups, that base rate would push the probability above 50%.

Given the information favoring computer science, but acknowledging the uncertainty involved, I'd estimate a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor from this sample. But more information about Jason and the other professors' typical profiles would be needed for a confident assessment.
