Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical rather than artistic pursuits.
- The sample included 75 CS professors and only 25 humanities professors, so selecting a CS professor at random is more probable.

Without more distinguishing details, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 75%, based mainly on the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample.
