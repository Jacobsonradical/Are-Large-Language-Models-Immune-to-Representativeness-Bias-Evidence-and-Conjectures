Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.80"}

The key pieces of information that lead me to assign a high probability of Jason being a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. Computer science made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there's a high prior probability he's a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed estimate rather than a certainty. There could certainly be humanities professors who fit Jason's description. But the details provided, especially his hobbies, seem to point more towards computer science than the humanities.
