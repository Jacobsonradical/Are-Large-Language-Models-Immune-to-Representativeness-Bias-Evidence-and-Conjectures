Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing, combined with his personality traits of being careful and ambitious, seem more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

However, without more detailed statistics on the overall population distributions of computer science vs. humanities professors, or the methodology used to select this sample, I cannot say this with extremely high confidence. There is certainly a possibility that Jason could be one of the 25% of professors from the humanities group.
