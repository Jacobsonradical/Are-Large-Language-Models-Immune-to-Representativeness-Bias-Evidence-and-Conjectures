Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative, aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, without more specific data on the relative frequencies of these traits in the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The provided probability reflects an educated guess based on the given description, while acknowledging the limitations of making a definitive judgment from this single data point.
