Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more common among computer science professors, such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing. However, without more data on the typical traits of professors in each field, I cannot be highly certain in my estimate. More information comparing the two groups would allow for a more precise probability assessment.
