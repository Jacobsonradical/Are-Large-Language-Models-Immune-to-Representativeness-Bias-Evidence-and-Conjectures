Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science professor, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in creative writing and drawing also points more towards computer science than humanities. Additionally, the sample included 75 computer science professors compared to only 25 humanities professors.

However, without more comparative data on the traits of the two professor groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate, so I wouldn't put the probability higher than 0.75.
