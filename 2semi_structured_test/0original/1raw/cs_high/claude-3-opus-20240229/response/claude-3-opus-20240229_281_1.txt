Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being highly creative, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves logical and analytical thinking, which aligns with Jason's interests.

However, without more detailed information on the specific personality traits the study found to be associated with each group of professors, this is still a somewhat speculative probability estimate based on stereotypical assumptions. More data on the actual study findings would allow for a more precise and confident estimate.
