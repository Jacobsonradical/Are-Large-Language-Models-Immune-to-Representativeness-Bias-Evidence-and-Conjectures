Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, a few key details suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, activities that may be more common for humanities professors.
- Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% being humanities professors. So all else being equal, there's a higher base rate probability of him being a CS professor.

Given this, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is around 0.8 or 80%.
