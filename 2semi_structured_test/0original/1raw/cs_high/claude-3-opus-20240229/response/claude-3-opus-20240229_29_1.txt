Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more analytically than artistically inclined. This is more typical of computer science professors.

3. Personality traits like being careful and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both disciplines. 

4. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So even before considering Jason's specific traits, there was a 75% probability of him being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed guess based on limited information and stereotypes. More details about Jason's specific research interests, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive classification. But based solely on the description provided, I believe a 75% probability of him being a computer science professor is a reasonable estimate.
