Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he may be more oriented towards computer science. 

3. However, the description does not provide definitively conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Additional information about his specific research interests, publications, and academic background would allow a more certain determination.

So while the description suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, there is still some uncertainty based on the limited information provided. Therefore, I estimate a 75% probability rather than a near-certainty.
