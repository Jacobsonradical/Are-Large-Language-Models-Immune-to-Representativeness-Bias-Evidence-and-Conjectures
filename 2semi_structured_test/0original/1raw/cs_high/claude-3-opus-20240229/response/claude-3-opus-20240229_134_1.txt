Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His hobbies don't include stereotypically humanities-related activities like drawing or writing

On the other hand, the description doesn't give any definitive indication of his field, and many of the details (married with kids, personality traits, jogging) seem field-agnostic.

Given there were 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of him being a CS professor. The hobbies push that estimate higher but not overwhelmingly so given the limited information.

My estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.8"}
