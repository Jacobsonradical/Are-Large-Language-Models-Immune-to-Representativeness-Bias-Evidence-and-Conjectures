Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science professors more than humanities professors. 

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science than humanities.

3. However, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence that he is definitely a computer science professor. Additional information about his specific research areas and published works would help refine the probability estimate further.

So while the description suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor, there is still some uncertainty, which is why I estimated the probability at 0.75 rather than a value closer to 1.
