Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science rather than humanities. 

At the same time, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Many of the other traits and biographical details could apply to successful professors in either field.

Given the base rates of 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors in the sample, and weighing the details slightly favoring computer science, I estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is around 80%:
