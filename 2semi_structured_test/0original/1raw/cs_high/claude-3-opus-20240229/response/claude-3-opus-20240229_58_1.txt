Based on the limited information provided in the description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical interests for computer science professors.

2. His dislike of drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more analytically than artistically inclined. 

3. The study's sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, without more definitive information directly related to his field of study, I cannot be certain he is a computer science professor, hence an estimate of 0.75 rather than a higher value closer to 1. The description leaves open the possibility that Jason could be one of the humanities professors who happens to have more analytical hobbies and inclinations.
