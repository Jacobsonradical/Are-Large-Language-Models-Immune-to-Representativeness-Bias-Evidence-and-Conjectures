Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated more with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests a stronger inclination towards computer science. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not conclusively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The 0.75 probability reflects a balance between the sample composition and the specific details in Jason's description that point towards computer science.
