Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves logical problem solving and programming.

However, without more details on the specific distribution of personality traits between the two groups of professors, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given his description, while acknowledging the information is incomplete to say definitively. More data on how the described traits correlate with each professor group would allow for a more precise estimate.
