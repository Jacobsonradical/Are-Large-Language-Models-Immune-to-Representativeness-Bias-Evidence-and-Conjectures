Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science tends to attract people with strong logical, mathematical, and analytical skills.

However, without more detailed data on the relative prevalence of these traits among the two groups of professors, I cannot give a precise probability. The study's small sample size, especially for humanities professors, also limits the confidence of any probability estimate. More details on the study methodology and results would allow for a more definitive assessment.
