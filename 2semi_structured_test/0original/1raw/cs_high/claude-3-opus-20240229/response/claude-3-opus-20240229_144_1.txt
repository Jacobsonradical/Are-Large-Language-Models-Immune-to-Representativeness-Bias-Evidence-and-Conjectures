Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. Computer science made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a 75% prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

However, I didn't assign a probability higher than 0.75 because the description doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Some additional information that could shift the probability higher would be details about his specific research areas or the department where he teaches.
