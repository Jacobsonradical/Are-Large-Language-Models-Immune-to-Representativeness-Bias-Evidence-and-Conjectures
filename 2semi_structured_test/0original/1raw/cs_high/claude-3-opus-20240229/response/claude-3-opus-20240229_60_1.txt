Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggestive of a more analytical than artistic personality.

3. The study sample includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science.

However, I don't have complete certainty, as the description doesn't explicitly state Jason's field, and there can certainly be humanities professors who fit a similar personality profile. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably confident educated guess based on the available information and priors.
