Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests a stronger inclination towards computer science over the humanities.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. Given Jason's described traits and interests align more with computer science, and considering the sample composition, there is a higher prior probability that a randomly selected description would belong to a computer science professor.
