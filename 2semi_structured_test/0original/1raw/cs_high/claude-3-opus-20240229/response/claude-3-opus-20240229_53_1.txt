Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science.

3. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful academics in both computer science and humanities. 

4. The sample size of computer science professors (75) is much larger than that of humanities professors (25), so there is a higher prior probability of any given individual being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. More data points about Jason's specific research interests, publication record, and academic background would allow for a more precise estimate.
