Based on the given description, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.80"}

The key factors that lead me to assign a high probability are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait that is valuable in computer science for developing novel algorithms and solutions. 

3. The description mentions he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic, fitting the typical profile of a computer scientist.

4. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so all else being equal, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being from that group.

Of course, this is still an estimate based on limited information. The description does not definitively prove Jason is a computer science professor, but the mentioned traits and hobbies are certainly suggestive of that being likely.
