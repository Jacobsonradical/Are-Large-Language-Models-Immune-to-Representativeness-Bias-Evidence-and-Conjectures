This is a challenging question that requires carefully weighing the limited information provided. Some key factors to consider:

The description mentions Jason enjoys coding and math puzzles, which seem more aligned with computer science than the humanities. It also notes he is not drawn to creative writing or art.

However, the description provides no information about Jason's specific field, research focus, or academic accomplishments that would more definitively identify him as a computer science vs humanities professor. Personal hobbies and interests have limited predictive power.

The base rates are also relevant - the sample contains 75% computer science professors. Absent other distinguishing information, this means there is a 75% prior probability of any randomly selected description being a CS professor.

Putting this all together, the coding and math interest provide a small signal towards computer science, and the 75% base rate is also suggestive. But there are many other unknown factors. As a rough estimate, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.8"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very approximate estimate given the limited information to go on. More details about Jason's specific academic focus and achievements would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
