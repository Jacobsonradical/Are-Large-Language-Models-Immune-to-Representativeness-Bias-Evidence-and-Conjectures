To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the specific details provided.

Prior probability:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.

Relevant details from the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities.

Considering the prior probability and the description details, the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is likely higher than the base rate of 0.75.
