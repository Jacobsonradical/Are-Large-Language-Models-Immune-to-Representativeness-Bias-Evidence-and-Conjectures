Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science than humanities.

However, without more detailed data on the overall distribution of traits among the two groups of professors, I can't be highly certain in my estimate. The description is also quite brief. So while I believe there is a higher probability Jason is a computer science professor vs humanities based on the description, I don't have enough information to give an estimate with very high confidence.
