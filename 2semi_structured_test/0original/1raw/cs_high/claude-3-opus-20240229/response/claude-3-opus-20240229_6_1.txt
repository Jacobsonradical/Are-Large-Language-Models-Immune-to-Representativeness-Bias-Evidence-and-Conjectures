Based on the description provided, here is my assessment of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests more of a technical/analytical bent rather than an artistic/humanities one. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being one of a computer science professor.

4. No strong evidence was provided in the description to suggest Jason is more likely a humanities professor.

So while not a certainty, the description is highly suggestive that Jason is more likely to be one of the computer science professors in this particular study sample. Thus, a probability of 0.85 seems appropriate to capture this.
