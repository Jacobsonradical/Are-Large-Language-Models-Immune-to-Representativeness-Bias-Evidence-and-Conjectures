Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a STEM field than the humanities. 

3. Being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious are traits that could apply to successful professors in both computer science and humanities.

4. The base rates in the sample are 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors. Without strong distinguishing evidence, the prior odds favor him being a computer science professor.

So while not definitive, the description suggests a relatively high probability (I estimate 75%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this particular sample. But more individuating information would be needed for a more precise estimate.
