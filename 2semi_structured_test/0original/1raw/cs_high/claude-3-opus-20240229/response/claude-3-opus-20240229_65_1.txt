Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more detailed information, there is still some uncertainty. The 3:1 ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the overall sample also factors into assessing the probability that a randomly selected description would belong to a computer science professor.
