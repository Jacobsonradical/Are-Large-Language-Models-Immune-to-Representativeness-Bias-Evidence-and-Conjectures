Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science professors. It also notes that despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities. Additionally, computer science professors made up 75% of the sample.

However, this is a relatively naive guess based on stereotypes and limited data from one description. Much more information would be needed to make a truly informed estimate of the probability. The study methodology and conclusions should not be overgeneralized based on a single data point.
