Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing also seems more common for computer scientists than humanities scholars, who often engage in writing.

That said, these are just broad stereotypes and associations. There are certainly creative coders in the humanities and mathematically-inclined puzzle solvers who don't enjoy writing. The personality description is quite limited to make a confident assessment.

If I had to give a rough probability estimate based solely on this brief description, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to emphasize this is highly speculative based on very limited information and broad stereotypes. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, teaching topics etc. would be needed to give a more confident estimate of which field he likely specializes in. The 100 person sample also seems fairly skewed (75% computer science) which may affect the base rate probability as well.
