Based on the limited information provided, here is my estimate:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative writing or drawing, combined with his analytical and ambitious nature, leads me to believe there is a high probability he is one of the computer science professors in the sample rather than one of the humanities professors. However, without more details on the specific traits that differentiated the two groups in the study, I cannot say this with certainty, so I estimate an 80% probability rather than a near 100% probability.
