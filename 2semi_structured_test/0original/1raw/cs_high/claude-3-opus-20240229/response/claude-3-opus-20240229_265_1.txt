To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided and see how well it aligns with stereotypical traits of computer science professors versus humanities professors.

Relevant information:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more with computer science.
- Despite being creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.
- No other information strongly suggests an association with either field.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75%.

Considering the relevant information, which suggests a stronger alignment with computer science, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be somewhat higher than the base rate.

{"probability": "0.85"}
