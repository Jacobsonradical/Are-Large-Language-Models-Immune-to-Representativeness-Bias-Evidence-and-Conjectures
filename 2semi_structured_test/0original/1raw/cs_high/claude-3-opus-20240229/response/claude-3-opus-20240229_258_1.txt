Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His personality traits of being careful and ambitious could apply to either field.

However, without more detailed data on the actual distribution of these traits and interests among the sample of computer science vs humanities professors, this probability estimate has a high degree of uncertainty. More data points beyond a single description would be needed to assign a probability with strong confidence.
