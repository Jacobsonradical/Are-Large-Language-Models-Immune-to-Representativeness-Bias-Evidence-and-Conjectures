Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His profile mentions that despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creative outlets may be more technical than artistic. 

Given these points, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be moderately higher than the baseline of 75% computer science professors in the overall sample. My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.85"}

However, I want to emphasize this is a very tentative estimate based on extremely limited information and stereotypical associations. Many more details would be needed to assign a probability with real confidence. The description also includes various traits (e.g. being married with five children, jogging) that seem unrelated to field of study. Overall, while the description provides some basis for an educated guess, there is still significant uncertainty in determining Jason's likelihood of being a computer science vs. humanities professor.
