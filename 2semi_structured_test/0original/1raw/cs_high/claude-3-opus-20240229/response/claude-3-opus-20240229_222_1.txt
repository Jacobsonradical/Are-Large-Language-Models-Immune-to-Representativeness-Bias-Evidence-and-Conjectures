Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75%) compared to humanities (25%).

Without more definitive information though, this is still a judgment call based on stereotypes and the sample composition. Many humanities professors could also fit this profile.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on what's given, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to stress this is a very rough estimate with low confidence based on limited data that relies on generalizations. More specific information about Jason's field, research focus, publications, and academic background would be needed to make a properly informed determination.
