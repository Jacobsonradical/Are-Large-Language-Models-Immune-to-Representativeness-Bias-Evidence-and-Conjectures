Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than in the humanities.

3. Traits like being conservative, careful, and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields. 

4. The sample included more computer science professors (75) than humanities professors (25), so there is a higher base rate probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, without more specific information directly related to his field of study or research, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate.
