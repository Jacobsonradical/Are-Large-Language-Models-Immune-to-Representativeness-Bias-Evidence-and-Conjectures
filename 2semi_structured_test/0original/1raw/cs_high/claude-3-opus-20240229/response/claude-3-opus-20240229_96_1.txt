To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, I'll consider the relevant information provided:

- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability of any randomly selected professor being in computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities stereotypically associated with computer science. This is evidence in favor of him being a computer science professor.

- However, the description also notes that despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing. This could slightly point away from humanities, but is not very strong evidence. 

- The other personal details like his age, marital status, political leanings, and jogging hobby don't seem particularly relevant in distinguishing the fields.

Considering the high prior probability and the hobby evidence pointing towards computer science, I believe there is a high probability Jason is a computer science professor. However, I don't have enough strong distinguishing information to give an extreme probability near 1.
