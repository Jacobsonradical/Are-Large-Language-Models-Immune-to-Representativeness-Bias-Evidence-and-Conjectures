Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that led me to this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a STEM field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being one of a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and some of the other details like his family and hobbies do not clearly distinguish between the two academic fields. There is still some possibility he could be a humanities professor. But the computer science related traits make it much more likely than not that he is a computer science professor in this sample.
