Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, based on the description, there are some clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- While he is described as highly creative, his lack of interest in drawing and writing suggests his creativity may manifest more in technical or analytical domains.
- Computer science had a larger representation in the overall sample (75% CS vs 25% humanities)

That said, none of these factors are conclusive. Humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding as well. And the sample sizes of the two groups, while skewed, aren't so extreme as to overwhelmingly tilt the probability.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 70%:
