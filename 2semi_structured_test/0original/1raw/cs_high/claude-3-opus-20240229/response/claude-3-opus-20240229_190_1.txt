Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more details on the specific personality traits that tended to be associated with each group of professors in the study, I cannot say this with extremely high confidence. There is still some possibility that a humanities professor could have a similar profile. So I believe a probability of 0.75 reflects my level of confidence given the information available.
