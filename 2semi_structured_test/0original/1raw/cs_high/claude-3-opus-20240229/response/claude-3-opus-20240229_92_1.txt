Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative could suggest more technical/analytical creative outlets, like computer science

However, these are just general associations and there are certainly humanities professors who fit this profile and computer science professors who don't. Conservatism, talent, ambition, and jogging don't clearly distinguish between the fields.

Given the study had 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor. 

Weighing the limited evidence pointing slightly more to computer science against the high base rate of computer science professors in the sample, I'd estimate:

{"probability": "0.80"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information and broad stereotypes. Much more data would be needed to make confident judgments about any individual's field based on a brief personality description.
