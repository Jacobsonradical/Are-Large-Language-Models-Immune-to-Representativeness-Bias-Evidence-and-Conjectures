Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than the humanities. His lack of interest in creative writing and drawing also points more towards computer science. Additionally, the sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being from the computer science group.

However, without more definitive information, there is still some uncertainty. The personality traits mentioned could potentially apply to either group. So while I believe the probability is reasonably high that Jason is a computer science professor, I don't have enough confidence to give a probability above 75%.
