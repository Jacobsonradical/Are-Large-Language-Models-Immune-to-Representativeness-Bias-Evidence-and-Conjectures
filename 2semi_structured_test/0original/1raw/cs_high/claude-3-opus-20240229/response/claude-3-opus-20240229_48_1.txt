Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are traits more typically associated with computer science professors. It also notes that despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more humanities-oriented creative pursuits.

However, without more detailed data on the overall distribution of traits among the two groups of professors, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The probability I gave reflects my best guess based on the description, while acknowledging that there is a possibility Jason could be a humanities professor who happens to also enjoy math and coding.
