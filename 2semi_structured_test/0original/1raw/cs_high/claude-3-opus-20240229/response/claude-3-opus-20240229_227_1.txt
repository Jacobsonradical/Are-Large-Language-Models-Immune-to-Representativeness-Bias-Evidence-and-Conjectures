Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science academics.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creative outlets may lie more in technical rather than artistic domains.

- Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so there is a higher prior probability of any given profile being a computer science professor.

That said, these are stereotypical associations and there is certainly individual variation. Humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding, and an interest in jogging is not particularly indicative of field.

If I had to estimate a probability based on the limited information available, I would say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on some generalizations. More data points about research focus, publication history, departments, etc. would allow for a more confident assessment. The description also lacks information on what makes Jason a "successful" professor. But based solely on the personal details provided, I believe there is a moderately higher chance of him being a computer science professor than a humanities one in this particular sample.
