Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key pieces of information that lead me to assign a relatively high probability that Jason is a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a high prior probability of him being a CS professor.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 0.75 because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful academics across many fields. More specific information about his research area and publications would help further pinpoint the probability.
