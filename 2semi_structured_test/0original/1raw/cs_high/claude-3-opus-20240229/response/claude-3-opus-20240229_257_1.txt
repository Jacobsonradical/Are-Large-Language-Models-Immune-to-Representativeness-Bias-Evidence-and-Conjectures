Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a STEM field than the humanities. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

4. However, the description is not conclusive, as there could certainly be humanities professors fitting Jason's profile. Conservative political views, ambition, and having a large family are not necessarily predictive of being a computer science professor.

So while the description suggests Jason is very likely a computer science professor, I wouldn't assign a probability higher than 80% to allow for the possibility he is one of the humanities professors. The question cannot be answered with certainty based on the information provided.
