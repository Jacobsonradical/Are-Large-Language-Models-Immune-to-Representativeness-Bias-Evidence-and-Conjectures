Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. While he is described as highly creative, his lack of interest in drawing or writing suggests his creativity may be more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. 

3. His personality is described as conservative and careful, traits that may be more common in technical fields compared to the humanities.

4. Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so absent other distinguishing information, the base rate alone would predict a 75% chance of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an estimated probability based on limited information and some general assumptions. More details about his specific research focus, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive classification. But based on the personality description alone, I believe it is highly likely, though not certain, that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the study.
