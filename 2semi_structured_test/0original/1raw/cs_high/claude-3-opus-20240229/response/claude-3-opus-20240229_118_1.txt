Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. It also notes that despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might indicate more of a technical than artistic inclination.

However, without more detailed information about the specific criteria used to determine "success" for the professors in each field, or the distribution of other personality traits between the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The sample also included 3 times as many computer science professors as humanities professors, which I factored into my probability estimate.
