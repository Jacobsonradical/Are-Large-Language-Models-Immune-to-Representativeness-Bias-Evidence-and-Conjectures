Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to conclusively determine Jason's field. However, some key details suggest a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists
- Highly creative, a valuable trait in computer science for developing novel algorithms and approaches
- Doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, perhaps indicating less interest in humanities fields

At the same time, the description doesn't rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Ultimately, more information about his specific research focus, publications, and academic background would be needed for a definitive assessment.

Given the study's baseline of 75% computer science professors, and the described traits that seem to align more with a computer science background, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.80"}
