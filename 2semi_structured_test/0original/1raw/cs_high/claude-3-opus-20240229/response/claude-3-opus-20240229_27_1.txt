Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:
1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.
2) His profile mentions being creative, but not enjoying drawing or writing, which seems more consistent with a computer science background than humanities. 
3) The overall sample contains 75% computer science professors.

However, I acknowledge there is still significant uncertainty given the brief description provided. Factors like his family situation and personality traits like being conservative and ambitious could apply to successful professors across many fields. More details about his specific research focus, academic background, and creative outlets would allow for a more definitive assessment.
