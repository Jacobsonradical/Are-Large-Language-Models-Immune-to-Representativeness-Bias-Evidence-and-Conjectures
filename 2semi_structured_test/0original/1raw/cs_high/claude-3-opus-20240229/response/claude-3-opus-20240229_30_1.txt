Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't like drawing or writing, creative pursuits more often found in the humanities.

On the other hand, the description doesn't mention any specific computer science research or teaching, and many of the other traits (being married with children, careful, ambitious, enjoying jogging) seem equally applicable to both groups.

Given the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, and the mild evidence pointing to CS over humanities based on Jason's hobbies, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.8.
