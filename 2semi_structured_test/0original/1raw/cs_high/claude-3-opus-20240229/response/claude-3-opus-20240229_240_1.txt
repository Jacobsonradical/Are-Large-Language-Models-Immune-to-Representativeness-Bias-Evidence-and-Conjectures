Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to artistic pursuits like drawing or writing, coupled with his talent and ambition, seems more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more data on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given his described traits, while allowing for the possibility that some humanities professors could share similar characteristics.
