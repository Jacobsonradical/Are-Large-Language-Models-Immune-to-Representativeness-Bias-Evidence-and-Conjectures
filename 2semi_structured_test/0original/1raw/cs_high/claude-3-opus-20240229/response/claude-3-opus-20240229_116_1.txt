Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. 

However, without more details on the specific personality traits the study focused on, and how those traits differed between the two groups of professors, there is still some uncertainty. The description alone is not definitive proof of Jason being a computer science professor. Hence, I estimate a 75% probability rather than a near certainty.
