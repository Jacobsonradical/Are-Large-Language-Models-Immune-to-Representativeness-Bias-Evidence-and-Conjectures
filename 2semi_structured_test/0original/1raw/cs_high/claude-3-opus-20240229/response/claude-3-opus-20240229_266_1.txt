Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details stand out that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related fields.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity is expressed more through technical or analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. 

- Computer science had a larger representation in the study sample (75% were CS professors).

Without more definitive information it's impossible to say for certain, but considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be around 70%:
