Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some of his traits and interests, like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, may be more stereotypically associated with computer science. However, these traits alone are not enough to determine his field with high confidence, as there is significant individual variation within professions.

Without more specific data on the distribution of traits between the two professor groups in the sample, I'll make a conservative estimate that Jason is more likely than not to be a computer science professor, but not with extremely high probability.
