Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward technical rather than artistic pursuits.
- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75%) compared to humanities (25%).

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who enjoy logic puzzles and dislike writing. More individual details about Jason's specific research focus and publications would help inform the probability estimate.

If I had to give a rough probability based solely on the description provided, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. Many more personal details about Jason would be needed to meaningfully estimate the probability of his field with any real precision.
