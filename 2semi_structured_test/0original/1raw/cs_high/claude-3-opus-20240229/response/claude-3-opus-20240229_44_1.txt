Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.
2. His hobbies and personality traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious) seem more aligned with a analytical, technical field like computer science rather than the humanities. 
3. The lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing despite being creative also points more towards technical rather than artistic inclinations.
4. The study sample included 75% computer science professors, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a relatively high prior probability of him being a CS professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The given traits are indicative but not absolute proof of his field.
