Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities which may be more common among humanities professors.

Without more information about the relative proportions of these traits between the two groups, I'll estimate the probability conservatively.
