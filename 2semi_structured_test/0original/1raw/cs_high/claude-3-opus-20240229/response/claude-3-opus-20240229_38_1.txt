Based on the given description, my assessment is:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science interests and skills.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there is a higher prior probability of a randomly selected profile being from that group.

However, there is still some uncertainty since the description doesn't definitively state Jason's profession, and there could be humanities professors with similar traits and interests. The 0.8 probability reflects a high likelihood of him being a CS professor based on the available information, while allowing for the possibility he belongs to the humanities group.
