Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Computer science professors can certainly enjoy writing, and humanities professors may enjoy math and coding as hobbies.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7 or 70%. But this is a tentative estimate based on limited data.
