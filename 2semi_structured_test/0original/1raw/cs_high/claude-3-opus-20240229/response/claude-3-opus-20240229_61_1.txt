Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing despite being creative, which suggests his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic.

3. Personality traits like being careful and ambitious, which while not exclusive to computer science, may be more commonly found in STEM fields.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0 because the description does not conclusively prove Jason is a computer science professor. Some humanities professors could share similar traits and interests. More definitive information, like his specific research areas or academic background, would be needed for complete certainty.
