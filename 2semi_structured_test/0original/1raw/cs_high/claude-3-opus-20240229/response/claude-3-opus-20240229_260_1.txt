Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common interests among computer scientists.

2. While he is described as highly creative, his lack of interest in drawing or writing suggests his creativity may be more oriented towards technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic ones. 

3. His personality is described as conservative, careful, and ambitious, traits which may be more prevalent among STEM academics compared to humanities professors (although this is a broad generalization).

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the interests and personality traits mentioned don't definitively identify him as a computer scientist. More specific information about his research focus, publications, and academic background would help increase the confidence of the estimate. But based solely on the description provided, I believe a 75% probability appropriately reflects that he is more likely a computer science professor while allowing for some possibility he could be in the humanities.
