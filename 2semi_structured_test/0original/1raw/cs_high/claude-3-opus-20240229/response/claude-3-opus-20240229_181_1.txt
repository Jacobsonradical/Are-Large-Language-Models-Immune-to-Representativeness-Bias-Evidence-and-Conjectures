Based on the limited information provided about Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing, combined with his talent and ambition, seem to align more closely with a stereotypical profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, without more specific information it's impossible to say definitively, so I am assigning a probability of 0.8 rather than a near certainty.
