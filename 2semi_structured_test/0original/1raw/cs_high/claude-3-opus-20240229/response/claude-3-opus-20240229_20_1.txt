Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more analytically than artistically inclined. This fits the typical profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

3. The sample size of computer science professors (75) is much larger than that of humanities professors (25), so even before considering the description, there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not completely rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Some personal characteristics mentioned, like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious, could apply to successful professors in many fields.
