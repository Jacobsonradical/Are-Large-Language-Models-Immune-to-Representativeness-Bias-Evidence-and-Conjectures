Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Traits like being conservative, careful, and ambitious are fairly common among successful academics across fields, so they don't strongly point to either group.

4. The description doesn't mention any humanities-related interests that would make it more likely for Jason to be a humanities professor.

Of course, this is a rough estimate based on limited information and some generalizations. More details about Jason's specific research areas, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive determination. But based on what's provided, I believe there is a high probability (around 80%) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
