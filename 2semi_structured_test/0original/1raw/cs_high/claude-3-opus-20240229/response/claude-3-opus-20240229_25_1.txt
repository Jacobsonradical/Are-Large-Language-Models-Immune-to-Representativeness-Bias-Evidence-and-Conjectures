Here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The description contains several clues that point towards Jason more likely being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and related STEM fields.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities. 

3. His personality traits of being careful, talented and ambitious fit a common stereotype of computer scientists and engineers.

However, without knowing the full demographic makeup and personalities of the sample group, there is still some uncertainty. The description alone is not definitive proof of his field. But based on the limited information provided, I believe there is roughly an 85% chance Jason is one of the computer science professors in the study. Let me know if you would like me to explain my reasoning further.
