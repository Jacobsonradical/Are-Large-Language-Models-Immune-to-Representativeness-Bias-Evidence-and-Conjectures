Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some key details suggest a higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical interests and skills of computer science professors. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science than humanities.
- The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there's a higher prior probability of any given description being a computer science professor.

Without more definitive information to go on, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be around 0.75. But this is a rough guess given the limited data.
