Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without more specific information about the distribution of these traits between the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high confidence that Jason is a computer science professor, but allows for the possibility that some humanities professors could also fit this profile.
