Given the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic.

At the same time, having a large family and enjoying jogging don't particularly distinguish between the two fields. And we can't rule out humanities professors enjoying logic puzzles or coding as a hobby.

If I had to give a probability based on this description alone, I'd say there's a moderately higher chance of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor, but not overwhelmingly so given the limited data. My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.65"}

That is, roughly a 65% chance he's a computer science professor and a 35% chance he's a humanities professor. But more details about his specific research focus, educational background, and professional activities would allow for a more definitive assessment.
