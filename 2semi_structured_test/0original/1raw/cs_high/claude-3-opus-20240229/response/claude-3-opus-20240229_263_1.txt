Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. The description mentions Jason being highly creative, a trait that is valuable in computer science for developing novel solutions and algorithms. 

3. Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, despite being creative. This suggests his creativity is more technical or analytical rather than artistic, fitting the profile of a computer scientist.

4. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So even before considering Jason's specific traits, there is a 75% prior probability he is a computer science professor.

Of course, this is still just an estimate based on limited information. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive determination. But based on the description alone, a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor seems warranted.
