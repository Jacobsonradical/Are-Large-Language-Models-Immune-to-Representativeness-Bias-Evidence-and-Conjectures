Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more analytically than artistically inclined. This fits the typical profile of a computer scientist better than a humanities professor.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a high prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed guess based on stereotypical traits and the composition of the sample, not a certainty. There could certainly be humanities professors who fit Jason's profile. But given the information available, I believe it is highly probable Jason is one of the computer science professors.
