Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and STEM fields more broadly. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may manifest more in technical or analytical domains.
- Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there's a higher prior probability of any given profile being a CS professor.

However, none of these factors are conclusive. Humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding, and many factors like his family life seem unrelated to his field. More details about his specific research focus and academic background would help determine the probability with greater confidence.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7. But this is a tentative estimate with considerable uncertainty.
