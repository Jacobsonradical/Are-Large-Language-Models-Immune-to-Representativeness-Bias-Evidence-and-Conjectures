Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities focus. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more details on the specific personality traits the study focused on or their relative distribution between the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The skewed sample sizes (75 CS professors vs 25 humanities) also makes an exact probability difficult to assign. But the details provided do seem to suggest a higher likelihood of Jason being one of the computer science professors sampled.
