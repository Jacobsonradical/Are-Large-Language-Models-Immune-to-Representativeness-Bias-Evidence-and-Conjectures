Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with computer science than the humanities
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities

At the same time, traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Given the description focuses more on traits and interests aligned with computer science, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be somewhat higher than him being a humanities professor, but not overwhelmingly so.

My rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
