Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. His talent and ambition also fit the profile of a successful academic.

However, without more detailed information on the specific traits the study found correlated with each field, and the overall distribution of those traits, I cannot give a precise probability - only a rough estimate based on Jason seeming to fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor more than that of a humanities professor. The actual probability could certainly be higher or lower than my 0.75 estimate.
