Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a relatively high prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is still an informed guess rather than a certainty. Some humanities professors may also enjoy coding and math, and some computer science professors may enjoy drawing and writing. But the described traits seem to point more towards computer science overall.
