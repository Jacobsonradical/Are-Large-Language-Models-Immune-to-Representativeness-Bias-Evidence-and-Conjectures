To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in his description and how it aligns with the characteristics of the sample population.

Given:
- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

However, the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor, as there could be some overlap in interests and characteristics between the two groups.

Considering the information provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

This probability is based on the fact that Jason's interests strongly align with those typically associated with computer science, and the sample population consists of a higher proportion of computer science professors (75%) compared to humanities professors (25%). However, there is still a possibility that he could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
