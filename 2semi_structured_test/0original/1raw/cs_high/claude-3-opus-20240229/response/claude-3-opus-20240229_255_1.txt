Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer scientists.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. This aligns with typical computer science skills.

3. Computer science made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% from humanities. So even without other information, there's a higher prior probability of a random individual being from the larger computer science group.

Of course, this is an estimated probability based on limited information and some generalizations. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, academic background, etc. would allow for a more definitive determination. But based on the personality description alone, the probability seems fairly high that he is one of the computer science professors.
