Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative, seems more common for computer science than humanities 

At the same time, other details like being married with five children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious don't clearly point to either field. And of course, there is significant individual variation - many computer scientists enjoy writing and many in the humanities enjoy math.

Given the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, combined with Jason's hobbies aligning somewhat more with stereotypical CS interests, I'd estimate approximately a 80% probability he is a computer science professor. But this is a very rough estimate given the limited information.
