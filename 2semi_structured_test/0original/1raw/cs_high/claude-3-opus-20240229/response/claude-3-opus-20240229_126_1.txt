Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more typically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing could slightly point away from the humanities, though this is a weaker signal

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, political leaning, talents and ambition don't strongly distinguish between the two fields.

Given the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, and the mild indications pointing towards CS, I'd estimate roughly a 80% probability Jason is a computer science professor.
