Based on the limited information provided in the personality description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science interests and skills.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests he may be more analytically than artistically inclined. This could point more towards a computer science background than humanities.

3. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence of his profession, and the stated personality traits could apply to successful professors in various fields. 

So while the description suggests a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor, without more specific information, there remains some uncertainty. Hence, I estimate a 75% probability rather than a near certainty.
