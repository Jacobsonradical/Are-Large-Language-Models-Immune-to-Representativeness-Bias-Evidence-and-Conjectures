Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some key points:

- His enjoyment of coding and math puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science
- However, computer science professors can certainly enjoy writing and drawing, and humanities professors can enjoy math and coding
- Other traits like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in either field
- The base rates are important - the sample has 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors

Weighing these factors, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor is moderately higher than the base rate, but far from certain given the information provided.
