To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more with the interests of a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with humanities professors.

However, it's important to note that the description does not provide definitive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Interests and hobbies can vary among individuals within the same field.

Given the limited information, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability estimate is based on the assumption that Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing and writing, make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. However, without more definitive information, there is still some uncertainty.
