Based on the given description, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he is more likely a computer science professor. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0 because the description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and some of the other traits mentioned could apply to humanities professors as well. The 0.75 probability reflects a balance of the strong indications of him being a computer science professor with the small possibility he could be one of the humanities professors.
