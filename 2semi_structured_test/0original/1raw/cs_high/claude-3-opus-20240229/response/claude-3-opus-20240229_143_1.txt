Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative, may point more towards quantitative creative outlets like computer science rather than arts/humanities

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem fairly generic and not strongly indicative of either field.

Given the 75% base rate of computer science professors in the sample, combined with the weak evidence pointing towards computer science, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at around 80%:
