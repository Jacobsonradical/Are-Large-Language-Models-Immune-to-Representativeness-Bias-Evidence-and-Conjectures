Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical interests for computer science professors.

2. His dislike for drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests he is more likely in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being from that group.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0 because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The other details about his personal life and general traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful academics in many fields.
