Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative outlets more often associated with humanities fields.

That said, there are successful coding-loving professors in the humanities and writing-averse professors in computer science, so these are far from certain indicators. And other details like his family life and personality traits seem less directly relevant.

Given the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, combined with the CS-leaning clues above, I'd estimate roughly a 80% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But this probability is highly uncertain given the limited information.
