Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typically associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative, point more towards a computer science background.

However, without more details on the specific traits the study found common among each group, there's still some uncertainty. The 75/25 split between CS and humanities professors in the sample also needs to be factored in. So while leaning towards CS, I don't think it's a near certainty based just on this description.
