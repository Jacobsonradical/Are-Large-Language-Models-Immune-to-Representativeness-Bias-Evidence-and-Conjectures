Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills for computer science professors.

2. Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing. This suggests his creativity may be more technical or analytical in nature, which aligns with computer science.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. So even without considering Jason's specific traits, there's a 75% prior probability he's a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 75% because the description does not rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. Some details, like being married with five children and enjoying jogging, seem neutral with respect to his field. More information would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
