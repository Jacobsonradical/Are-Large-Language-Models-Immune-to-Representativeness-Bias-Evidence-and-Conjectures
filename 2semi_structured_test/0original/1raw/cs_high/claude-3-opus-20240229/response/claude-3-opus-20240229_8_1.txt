Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science professors more so than humanities professors.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is less likely to be a humanities professor. 

3. Traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in both fields.

4. The sample has 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors. Lacking other distinguishing information, the base rate would suggest a 75% chance of Jason being a computer science professor.

So in summary, the specific hobbies and interests mentioned seem more consistent with a computer science background, and this aligns with the base rate probabilities in the sample. Therefore, I estimate a 75% probability, while acknowledging there is some uncertainty given the limited information provided.
