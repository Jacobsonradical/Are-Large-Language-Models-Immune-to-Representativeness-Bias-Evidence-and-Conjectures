Based on the given description, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2) His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities. 

3) Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a 75% prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed guess rather than a certainty. The description doesn't definitively identify his field, and there could be some humanities professors who share Jason's traits and interests. But considering the available information, computer science seems more probable than humanities for Jason.
