Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not being drawn to creative pursuits like drawing or writing, seems more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His analytical and logical traits fit the profile of many successful computer scientists.

However, without more data on the specific traits that were found to correlate with each group of professors in this particular study, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood based on the given description, while acknowledging the possibility that Jason could be one of the humanities professors who happens to have a more analytical/logical personality and set of interests.
