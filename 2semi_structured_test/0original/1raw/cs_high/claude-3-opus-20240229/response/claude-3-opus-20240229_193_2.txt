Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and quantitative fields
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, implying his creativity may manifest more in technical rather than artistic pursuits
- Computer science made up 75% of the sample, so all else being equal, there's a higher prior probability of him being a CS professor

That said, these are generalizations and the description is quite brief, so there's still significant uncertainty. Many humanities professors could certainly fit a similar profile.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the information given, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate with low confidence, given the limited data to go on. More details about his academic background, research focus, and other factors would allow for a much more informed estimate.
