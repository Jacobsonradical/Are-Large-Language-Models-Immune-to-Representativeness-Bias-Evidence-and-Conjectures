To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information given in his description.

Key points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity might be more suited to technical fields.
3. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Based on this information, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, we cannot be certain, as the description does not provide definitive evidence.

Considering the ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the study (3:1) and the traits that suggest Jason might be more inclined towards computer science, a reasonable probability estimate would be around 0.75.
