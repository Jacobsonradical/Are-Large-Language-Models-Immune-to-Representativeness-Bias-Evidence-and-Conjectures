Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, without more specific data on the distribution of these traits among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The probability I've given reflects my belief that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor based on the description, but acknowledges the inherent limitations in making such a judgment from this information alone.
