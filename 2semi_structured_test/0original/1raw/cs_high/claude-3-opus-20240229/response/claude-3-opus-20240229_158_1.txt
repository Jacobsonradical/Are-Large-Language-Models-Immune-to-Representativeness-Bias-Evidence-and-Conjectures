Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. 

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science than humanities.

3. However, the description does not provide conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so even if Jason's traits are more common among the computer science group, there is still a possibility he could be one of the humanities professors.

Without more definitive information directly indicating Jason's field, I estimate a 75% probability that he is one of the computer science professors, allowing for some uncertainty.
