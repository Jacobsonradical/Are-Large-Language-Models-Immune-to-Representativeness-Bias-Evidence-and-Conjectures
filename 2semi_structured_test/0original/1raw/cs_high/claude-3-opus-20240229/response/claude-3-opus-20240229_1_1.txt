Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors point to him being more likely a computer science professor, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also fits more with a stereotypical computer science professor profile. However, these are generalizations and many computer science professors do enjoy creative arts, while some humanities professors enjoy logic puzzles and avoid creative expression. Other details like his family status and personality traits could apply to professors in either field.

If I had to give a probability estimate, I'd say there's perhaps a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the sample description. But there's still a significant 30% chance he could be a humanities professor. More details about his specific research focus, academic background and teaching areas would help give a more definitive probability.
