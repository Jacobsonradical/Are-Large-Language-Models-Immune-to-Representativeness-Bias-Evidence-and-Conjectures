Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more analytically than artistically inclined. This fits the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there is a higher prior probability he belongs to that group.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility that Jason is a humanities professor. Some of his traits like being careful and ambitious are fairly generic and could apply to successful professors across disciplines.
