Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to assign a high probability are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypical interests of computer science professors.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. This fits the profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

Of course, this is just a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. The description does not definitively prove Jason is a computer science professor. More specific information about his academic background and research would be needed to assign a more definitive probability.
