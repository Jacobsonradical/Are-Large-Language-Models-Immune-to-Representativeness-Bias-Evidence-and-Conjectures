Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His talent and ambition also fit the profile of a successful academic.

However, without more detailed information about the distribution of personality traits, demographics, and interests between the two groups of professors in the sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. Additional context about how representative Jason's profile is of each group would allow for a more precise probability assessment.
