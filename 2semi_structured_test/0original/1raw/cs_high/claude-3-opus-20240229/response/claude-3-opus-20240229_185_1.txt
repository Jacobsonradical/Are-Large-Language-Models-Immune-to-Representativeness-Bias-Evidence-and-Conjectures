Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields more so than the humanities. 

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also fits more with a technical than artistic/literary inclination.

- The base rates in the sample were 75% computer science professors and only 25% humanities professors. Absent other distinguishing information, the prior odds favor computer science.

That said, these are only rough inferences based on limited data and stereotypes. Plenty of computer scientists enjoy art and writing, and humanities scholars can certainly be conservative, ambitious, enjoy jogging, dislike art, etc. More details about his specific research focus and intellectual passions would help distinguish the fields better.

Forced to give a probability estimate despite the uncertainty, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}
