Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science than the humanities. Additionally, the sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being of a computer science professor.

However, without more definitive information, there is still a reasonable chance Jason could be a humanities professor, so I wouldn't assign an extremely high probability. The 0.75 estimate reflects a solid likelihood based on the description while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.
