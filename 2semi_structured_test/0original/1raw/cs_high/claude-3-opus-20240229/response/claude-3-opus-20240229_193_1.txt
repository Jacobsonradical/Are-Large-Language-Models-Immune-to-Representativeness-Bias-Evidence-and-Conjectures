To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down:

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities.

Let's define the events:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor
- B: Jason has the given personality traits and interests

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality traits and interests.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75 (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (assumed probability of having these traits given that Jason is a computer science professor)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (assumed probability of having these traits given that Jason is a humanities professor)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.75 + 0.2 * 0.25
     = 0.65

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B)
