Based on the limited information provided in the description, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some aspects of his profile fit certain stereotypes associated with computer science, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Given that the sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the baseline probability of any randomly selected individual being a computer science professor is 75%. The details in Jason's description suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor.

Therefore, my rough estimate is:

{"probability": "0.85"}
