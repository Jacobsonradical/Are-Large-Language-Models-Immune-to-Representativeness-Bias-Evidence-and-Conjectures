Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science rather than humanities.

- Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so there is a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

That said, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Conservative, careful, talented and ambitious individuals can certainly be found in both fields. And the personal details about his family and jogging hobby seem largely irrelevant.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be moderately higher than him being a humanities professor, but far from certain. My rough estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.65"}
