Based on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more details on the specific personality traits that were found to correlate with each group, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The probability I gave reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given the description, but not a certainty.
