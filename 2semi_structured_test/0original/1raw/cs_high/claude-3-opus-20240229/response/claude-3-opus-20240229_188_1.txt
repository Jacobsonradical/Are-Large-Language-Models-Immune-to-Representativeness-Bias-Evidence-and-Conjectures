Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he may be more analytically than artistically inclined. This fits the stereotype of computer science professors more than humanities professors.

3. Successful computer science professors likely outnumber successful humanities professors in the general population, so even before considering Jason's specific traits, he is more likely to be a computer science professor given the 75/25 split in the sample.

However, I did not assign a probability too close to 1, because the description also contains some ambiguous information (e.g. being married with children, jogging) that does not clearly indicate his field. Additionally, relying too heavily on stereotypes should be avoided.
