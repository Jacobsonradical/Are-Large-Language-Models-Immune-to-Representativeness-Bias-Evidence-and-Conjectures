To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description, we need to consider the relevant information provided.

Key points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which suggests he might be a computer science professor.
2. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with humanities.
3. The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Without additional information about the distribution of these traits among the two groups, we can base our probability estimate on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

Given:
- Total sample size = 100
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25

Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.

Considering the traits mentioned that align with a computer science background, the probability might be slightly higher than the baseline of 0.75. However, without more data on the specific traits of each group, we cannot significantly deviate from this baseline.
