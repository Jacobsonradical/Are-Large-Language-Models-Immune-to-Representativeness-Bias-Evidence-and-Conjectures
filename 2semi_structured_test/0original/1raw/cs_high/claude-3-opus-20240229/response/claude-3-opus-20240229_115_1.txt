To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should consider the relevant information provided in his description and see how well it aligns with common traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Relevant points:
1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
2. He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity might be more aligned with problem-solving and logical thinking, rather than artistic pursuits.
3. The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

Based on these points, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, the description does not provide definitive evidence, so there is still some uncertainty.

Considering the base rates and the description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}
