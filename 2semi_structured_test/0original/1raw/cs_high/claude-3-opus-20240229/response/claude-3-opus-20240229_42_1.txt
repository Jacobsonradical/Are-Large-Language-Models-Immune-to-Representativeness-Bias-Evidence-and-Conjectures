Based on the limited information provided in the description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he may be more technically/analytically inclined than artistically inclined. This fits more with a computer science background.

3. However, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence that he is a computer science professor. Additional information about his research areas, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive assessment.

Also, it's important to keep in mind the base rates in the sample - 75% were computer science professors and 25% were humanities professors. This prior probability influences the posterior probability estimate.

So while I believe there is a high likelihood Jason is a computer science professor based on the description, I wouldn't assign a probability higher than the baseline of 75% without stronger individuating evidence.
