Based on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. His talent and ambition also fit the profile of a successful computer science professor.

However, without more detailed information about the relative proportions of these traits between the two groups of professors, and the size of the two groups (75% computer science, 25% humanities), there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The description alone is not definitive proof of Jason being a computer science professor.
