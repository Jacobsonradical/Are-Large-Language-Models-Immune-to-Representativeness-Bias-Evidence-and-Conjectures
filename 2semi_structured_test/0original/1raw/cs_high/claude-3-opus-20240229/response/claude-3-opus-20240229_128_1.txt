Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to assign a high probability are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait that is valuable in computer science for developing novel algorithms and solutions. 

3. The description mentions he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical rather than artistic domains, again pointing towards computer science.

4. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even before considering Jason's specific traits, there is a higher base rate probability he belongs to that group.

Of course, this is an educated guess based on limited information. The description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and there could certainly be humanities professors who share some of these traits. Nonetheless, the details provided point more strongly to a computer science background in my estimation.
