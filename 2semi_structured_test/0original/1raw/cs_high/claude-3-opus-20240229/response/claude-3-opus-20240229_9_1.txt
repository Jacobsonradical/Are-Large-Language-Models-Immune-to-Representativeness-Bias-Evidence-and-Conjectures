Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more data on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably strong likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given his described interests, but acknowledges the uncertainty from the limited information provided.
