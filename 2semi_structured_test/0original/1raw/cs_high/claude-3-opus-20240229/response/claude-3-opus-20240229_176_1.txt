Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing or writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. The study had a 3:1 ratio of computer science to humanities professors (75 vs 25), so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from the computer science group.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0 because the description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and some of the other traits mentioned could apply to individuals in various fields.
