Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait often associated with successful computer scientists who innovate in their field. 

3. However, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical/analytical domains rather than artistic ones, fitting the profile of a computer scientist.

4. His personality is described as careful and ambitious, traits that could align with a rigorous field like computer science.

The 0.85 probability estimate takes into account that 75% of the sample are computer science professors, so even without considering the description, there would be a high base rate probability. The description further strengthens the case that Jason is likely among that group of computer science professors rather than the humanities professors.
