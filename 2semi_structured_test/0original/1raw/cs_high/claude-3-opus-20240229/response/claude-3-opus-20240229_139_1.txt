Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors. 
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may lie more in technical domains like computer science rather than the arts and humanities.
- Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there's a higher prior probability of any given profile being a CS professor.

That said, these are stereotypes and many computer science and humanities professors certainly break the mold. Conservative and ambitious professors with large families exist in both fields. More details about his research focus, publications, and academic background would help distinguish which field he likely belongs to.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7, with the caveat that this is a rough estimate based on limited data prone to stereotyping. More details would be needed for a confident assessment.
