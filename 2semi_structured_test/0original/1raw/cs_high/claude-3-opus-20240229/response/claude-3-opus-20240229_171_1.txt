Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more closely with computer science than humanities.

2. His lack of interest in drawing or writing, despite being creative, suggests he is less likely to be in the humanities.

3. Computer science professors make up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, I acknowledge there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not definitively confirm Jason's field, and individuals can have diverse interests. The 0.75 probability reflects a balance of the evidence pointing towards computer science and the remaining uncertainty.
