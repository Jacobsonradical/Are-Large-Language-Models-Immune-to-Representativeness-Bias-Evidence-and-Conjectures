Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing, while being ambitious and talented, aligns more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. 

However, without more detailed data on the actual distribution of these traits among the two groups of professors in the sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The description alone is not enough to assign a definitive probability.
