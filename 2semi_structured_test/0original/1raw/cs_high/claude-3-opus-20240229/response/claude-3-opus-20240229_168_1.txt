Based on the limited information provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His dislike of drawing and writing despite being creative, again leaning more towards a computer science profile.

3. The study sample includes 75% computer science professors, so without strong distinguishing information, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of any given profile being a computer science professor.

However, the description is quite brief and doesn't provide highly definitive information to deviate too far from the base rate. More details about Jason's specific research interests, publications, and academic background would allow for a more precise estimate.
