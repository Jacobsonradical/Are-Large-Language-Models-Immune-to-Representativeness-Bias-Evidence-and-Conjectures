Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a STEM field like computer science rather than the humanities. 

3. Traits like being careful, talented and ambitious are common among successful academics in general, so those don't strongly distinguish between the two groups.

4. The prior base rates (75% computer science professors in the sample) also make it more likely a priori that a randomly selected description would be of a computer science professor.

Of course, this is still a rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. More details about his specific research interests, publications, and academic background would allow for a more definitive classification. But based solely on the personality description, computer science seems like the most probable field for Jason.
