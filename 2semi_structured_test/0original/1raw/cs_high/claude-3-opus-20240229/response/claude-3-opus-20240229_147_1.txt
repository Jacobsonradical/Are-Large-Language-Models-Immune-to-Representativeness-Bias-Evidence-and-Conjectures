Based on the given description, my estimate for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities closely associated with computer science.

2. Despite being creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting a preference for more technical and analytical pursuits.

3. The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Given Jason's interests align more with computer science, and the sample has a higher proportion of computer science professors, the probability of him being a computer science professor is higher.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimated probability based on limited information, and individual characteristics can vary within each field.
