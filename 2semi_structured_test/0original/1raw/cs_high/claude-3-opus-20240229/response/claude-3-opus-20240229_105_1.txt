Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few aspects of his description suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards technical rather than artistic pursuits.

That said, this evidence is far from conclusive. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy logic puzzles and not be artistically inclined. More telling information would be his specific research focuses and published papers.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say there is perhaps a 65-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor. But I would emphasize this is a tentative estimate given the limited data.
