Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, without more detailed information about the specific traits and backgrounds of computer science versus humanities professors in the sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate.
