Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors.
- His disinterest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creative outlets may lie more in technical and analytical domains.
- Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so there is a higher prior probability of any given profile being a CS professor.

That said, none of these factors are conclusive. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy coding and puzzles. And the study methodology makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the details provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But this is a very rough estimate with considerable uncertainty. More details about Jason's specific research focus, academic background, and the comparative personality trait distributions between the two groups would allow for a more precise and confident estimate.
