Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typical of a computer science professor, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science than the humanities. However, without more detailed information on the specific traits that distinguished the two groups in the study, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given his profile, while acknowledging it's not a certainty based solely on this brief description.
