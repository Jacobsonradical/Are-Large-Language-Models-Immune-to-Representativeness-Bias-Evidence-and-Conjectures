Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a STEM field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a relatively high prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed guess rather than a certainty. The description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way, and individuals can certainly have interests that don't align with stereotypes of their profession. But based on the limited information provided, computer science seems more probable than the humanities for Jason.
