Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem to align more with a typical computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may suggest less affinity for the humanities. 

- Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so there's a higher prior probability of any given profile being a CS professor.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide Jason's actual field, and interests/hobbies alone don't determine one's academic discipline. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 70%:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This reflects the fact that his profile suggests a somewhat higher likelihood of being in CS based on his interests, but there's still significant uncertainty given the limited data provided in the description.
