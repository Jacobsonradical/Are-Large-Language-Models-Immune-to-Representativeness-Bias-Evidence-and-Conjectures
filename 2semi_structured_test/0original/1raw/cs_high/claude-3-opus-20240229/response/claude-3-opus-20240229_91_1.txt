Based on the limited information provided in the description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key details that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.

2. Despite being highly creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity is more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

3. Computer science made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% from humanities, so there's a higher prior probability of any randomly selected individual being from the larger computer science group.

However, there isn't enough conclusive information to say with certainty (probability 1) that Jason is a computer science professor. The description doesn't specify his field, and it's possible for a humanities professor to also enjoy coding and math. More details about his specific research focus and academic background would help narrow it down further.
