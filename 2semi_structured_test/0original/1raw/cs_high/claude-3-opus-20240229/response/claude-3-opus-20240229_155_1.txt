Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves logical problem-solving and programming.

However, without more details on the specific personality traits that were found to be common among the professors in each field, there is still some uncertainty. The description alone does not conclusively identify Jason as a computer science professor, so I did not assign a probability at the very high end of the range.
