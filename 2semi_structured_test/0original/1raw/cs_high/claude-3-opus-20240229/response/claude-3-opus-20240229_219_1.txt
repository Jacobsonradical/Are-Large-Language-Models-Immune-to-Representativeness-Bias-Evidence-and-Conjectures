Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any given description being of a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not explicitly state Jason's profession, and there could be humanities professors with similar traits and interests. The 0.8 probability reflects a high likelihood of him being a computer science professor, while acknowledging the possibility that he could be one of the humanities professors.
