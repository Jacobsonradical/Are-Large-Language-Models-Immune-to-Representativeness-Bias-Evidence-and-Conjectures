Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science 

At the same time, the other personal details provided (age, marital status, number of children, personality traits like being conservative and ambitious) seem fairly generic and don't clearly indicate one field or the other.

Given the base rates of 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors in the sample, combined with the suggestive but not definitive details in his description, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at around:

{"probability": "0.8"}
