Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors.

- His dislike of drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic. 

- Computer science made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% humanities professors, so there's a higher prior probability of any random individual being a CS professor.

However, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, political leaning, personality traits, and jogging hobby seem less relevant and don't strongly distinguish between the two categories.

So in summary, while not conclusive, I believe the probability is higher that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor based on the sample details provided. As a rough estimate:

{"probability": "0.65"}
