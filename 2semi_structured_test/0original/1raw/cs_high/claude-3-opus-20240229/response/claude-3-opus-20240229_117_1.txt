Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, without more specific information about the relative proportions of these traits in the two groups, I cannot give a definitive probability. 0.75 represents my best estimate given the data provided, with the acknowledgment that additional information could change this assessment.
