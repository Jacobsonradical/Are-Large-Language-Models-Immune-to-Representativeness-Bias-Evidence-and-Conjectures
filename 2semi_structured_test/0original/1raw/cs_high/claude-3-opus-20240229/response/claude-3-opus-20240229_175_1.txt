Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves logical and analytical thinking, which aligns with an interest in coding and math.

However, without more specific information about the distribution of personality traits between the two professor groups, I cannot say with certainty that Jason is a computer science professor. There is still a possibility he could be one of the humanities professors. So I am assigning a 75% probability to reflect that Jason is more likely, but not definitively, a computer science professor based on the description provided.
