Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of an interest and aptitude for computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being highly creative, suggests his creative interests align more with technical and analytical pursuits rather than artistic/humanities fields. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a high prior probability of any randomly selected profile being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the enjoyment of coding and math puzzles does not guarantee someone is a computer science professor. There is still a possibility, even if small, that a humanities professor could have those traits and interests. The personality description is also not comprehensive enough to definitively rule out other possibilities.
