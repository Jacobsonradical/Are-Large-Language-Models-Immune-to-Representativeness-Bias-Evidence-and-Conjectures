Based on the description provided, here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key details that lead me to assign a high probability are:

1) Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2) He is described as highly creative, yet he does not enjoy drawing or writing. This suggests his creativity may be more technical or analytical in nature, as is often the case for computer scientists.

3) The sample contains 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is an inherent 75% prior probability of any randomly selected description being of a computer science professor.

Of course, there is some remaining uncertainty, as enjoying math and not drawing does not guarantee someone is a computer scientist. But putting the details together, along with the base rates in the sample, I believe 85% is a reasonable estimate of the probability Jason is a computer science professor based on his description.
