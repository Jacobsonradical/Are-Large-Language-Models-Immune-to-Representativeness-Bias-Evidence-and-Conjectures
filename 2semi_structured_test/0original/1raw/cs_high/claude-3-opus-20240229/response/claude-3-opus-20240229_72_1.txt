Here is my estimate of the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample:

{"probability": "0.85"}

Based on the description, several key traits suggest that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor:

1) His interests in coding and mathematical puzzles are strongly associated with computer science. 

2) His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science rather than humanities.

3) Being ambitious and talented could apply to either field, but together with his specific interests, it further suggests computer science is more probable.

4) Demographic factors like being a 45-year-old married man with children don't strongly distinguish between the fields.

Given the 75/25 split between CS and humanities professors in the sample, and Jason's specific traits pointing more to CS, I estimate a fairly high 85% chance he is a computer science professor. However, there is still some possibility he could be a humanities professor, so I did not assign an extremely high probability like 95%+.
