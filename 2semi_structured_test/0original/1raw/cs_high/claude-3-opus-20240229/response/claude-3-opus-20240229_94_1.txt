Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a higher base rate probability of a random individual being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, and academic background would allow for a more precise determination. But given the provided description, a probability of around 0.8 seems reasonable.
