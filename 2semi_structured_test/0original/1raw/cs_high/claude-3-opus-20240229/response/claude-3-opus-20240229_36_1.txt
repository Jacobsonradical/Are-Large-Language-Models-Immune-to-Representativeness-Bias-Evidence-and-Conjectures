Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science professors more than humanities professors.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards a computer science than humanities background. 

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so even without considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a 75% prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0, because the description does not definitively rule out Jason being a humanities professor. Some humanities fields like linguistics involve logical puzzles, and coding skills are increasingly useful across many academic disciplines. The description also does not mention other factors that could shift probabilities, like Jason's specific research topics or academic background.
