Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more common among computer science professors than humanities professors, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more data on the overall distribution of traits among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The sample also contained 3 times as many computer science professors, so that base rate alone would imply a 75% chance even before considering the specific description.
