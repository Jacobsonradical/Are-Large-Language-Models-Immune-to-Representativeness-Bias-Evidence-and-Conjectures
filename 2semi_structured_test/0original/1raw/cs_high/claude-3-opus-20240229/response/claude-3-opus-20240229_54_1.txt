Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- Not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative hints more towards quantitative rather than verbal creativity, which may fit better with computer science

On the other hand, the description doesn't provide any conclusive evidence that Jason is a computer science professor. Many of the other traits like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in either field.

Given that the original sample contained 75% computer science professors, and the description leans slightly more towards stereotypical computer science traits, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 80%:

{"probability": "0.8"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypical associations. Many more details would be needed to identify Jason's field with high confidence.
