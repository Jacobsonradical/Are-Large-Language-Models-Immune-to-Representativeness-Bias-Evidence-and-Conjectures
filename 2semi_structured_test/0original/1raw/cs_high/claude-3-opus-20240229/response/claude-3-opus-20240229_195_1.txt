Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields more so than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more commonly associated with the humanities.
- The sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so all else being equal, there's a 75% chance he's a computer science professor.

However, many of Jason's traits like being married with children, conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could easily apply to either group. And of course individual traits and interests vary widely.

Without more distinguishing information, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.65. But this is a tentative estimate given the limited data.
