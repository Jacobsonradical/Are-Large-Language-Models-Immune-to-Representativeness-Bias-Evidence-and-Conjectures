Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors
- Not enjoying drawing or writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may manifest more in technical/analytical domains rather than artistic ones, fitting more with computer science
- Being ambitious and talented could apply to either field, but may slightly favor the competitiveness of STEM fields like computer science

Without more definitive information though, this is somewhat speculative. Considering there are also 3 times as many computer science professors in the sample vs. humanities, increasing the base rate probability, I would estimate:

{"probability": "0.70"}

That is, I believe there is around a 70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description and sample composition. But more details about his specific research focus, undergraduate degree, or other attributes would help refine this estimate.
