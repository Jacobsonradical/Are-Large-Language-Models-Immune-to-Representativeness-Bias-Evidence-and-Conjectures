Based on the given description, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests a more technical inclination typical of computer science professors.

3. The study sample has a 3:1 ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not explicitly state Jason's profession, and some of the mentioned traits and interests could potentially apply to humanities professors as well.
