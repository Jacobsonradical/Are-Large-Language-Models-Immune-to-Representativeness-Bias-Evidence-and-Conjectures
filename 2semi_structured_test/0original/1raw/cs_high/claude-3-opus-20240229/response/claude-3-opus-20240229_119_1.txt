Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, there are some clues in his description that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical/analytical domains.
- Computer science professors outnumber humanities professors 3 to 1 in the sample. So all else being equal, a randomly selected professor is more likely to be a computer science professor.

That said, none of these factors are definitive. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy math and coding. And individual variations always exist despite aggregate trends.

If I had to put a probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But this is a tentative estimate given the limited information. More details about Jason's research focus, publications, academic department, etc. would allow a more definitive assessment. The description focuses on personal traits and hobbies which, while suggestive, don't conclusively identify his field.
