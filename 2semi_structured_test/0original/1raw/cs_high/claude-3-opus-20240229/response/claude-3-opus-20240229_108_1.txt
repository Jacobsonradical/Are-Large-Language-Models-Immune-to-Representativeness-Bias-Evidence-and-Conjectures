Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability of him being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science

At the same time, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem largely unrelated to his field.

Given the need to provide a specific probability estimate between 0 and 1, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description. But there's still a reasonable likelihood he could be a humanities professor.

So my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.65"}
