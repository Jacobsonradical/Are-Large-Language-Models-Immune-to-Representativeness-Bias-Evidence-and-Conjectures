Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. Some factors point to him being more likely a computer science professor, such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Computer science often involves these skills. However, the description also states he is creative, a trait that could be associated with the humanities as well.

Without more data on the relative frequency of these traits in the two groups, I don't feel I can give a probability estimate much different from the baseline rate of 75% computer science professors in the sample.

So my estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.75"}
