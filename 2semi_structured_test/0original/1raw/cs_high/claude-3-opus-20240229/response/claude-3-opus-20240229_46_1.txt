Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying more stereotypically artistic pursuits like drawing and writing, makes it seem more likely that he is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors in the sample. However, there is still a reasonable chance he could be a humanities professor, as the information provided is quite limited. The base rates of 75% computer science professors and 25% humanities professors in the overall sample also factor into my probability estimate.
