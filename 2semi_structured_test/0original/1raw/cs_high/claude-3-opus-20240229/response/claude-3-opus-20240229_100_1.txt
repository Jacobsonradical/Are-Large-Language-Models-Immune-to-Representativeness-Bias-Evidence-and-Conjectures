Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more specific information about the relative proportions of these traits among the two faculty groups, there is still some uncertainty. The 75% estimate reflects that the description is suggestive of computer science, but not definitive based on the information given.
