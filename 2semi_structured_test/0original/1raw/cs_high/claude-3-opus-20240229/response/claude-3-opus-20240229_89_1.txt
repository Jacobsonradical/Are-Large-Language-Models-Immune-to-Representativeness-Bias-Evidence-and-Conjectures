Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The traits and interests mentioned - being conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoying coding and math puzzles, not being drawn to creative arts like drawing or writing - align more closely with stereotypical traits of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, this is a generalization and individual traits vary, so there is still a reasonable chance Jason could be a humanities professor. Without more definitive information, I estimate a 75% probability that Jason is a computer science professor in this sample.
