Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science rather than humanities fields that often involve those activities.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75% were CS professors).

Without more definitive information though, this is still a judgment call based on stereotypes and the sample composition. Recognizing the uncertainty, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 0.7:

{"probability": "0.7"}
