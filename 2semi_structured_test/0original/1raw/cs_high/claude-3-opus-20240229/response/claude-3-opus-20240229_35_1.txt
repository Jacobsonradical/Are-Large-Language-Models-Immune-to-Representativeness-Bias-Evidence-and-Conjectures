Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- He is described as not enjoying drawing or writing despite being creative, which may point more toward technical/analytical creativity vs. artistic creativity.

- The sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected profile being a CS professor.

Without more definitive information though, significant uncertainty remains. As a rough estimate given the above points, I'd say there is perhaps a 70-80% chance Jason is a computer science professor. 

So my probability estimate is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
