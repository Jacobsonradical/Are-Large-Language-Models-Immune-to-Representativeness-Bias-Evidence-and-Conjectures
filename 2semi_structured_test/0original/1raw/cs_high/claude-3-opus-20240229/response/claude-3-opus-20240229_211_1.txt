Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, fits more closely with stereotypical traits often associated with computer science professors compared to humanities professors. His ambition and talent also align with being a successful tenured professor.

However, without more detailed information about the relative proportions of these traits between the two groups of professors in the study, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given the description, while acknowledging it's not a certainty based on the provided information alone.
