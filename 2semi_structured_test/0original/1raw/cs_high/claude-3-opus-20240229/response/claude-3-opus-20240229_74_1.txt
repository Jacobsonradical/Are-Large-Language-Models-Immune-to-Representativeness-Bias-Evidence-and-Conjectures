Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.85"}

The key factors that lead me to believe Jason is more likely a computer science professor are:

1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. Despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity may be more technical or analytical rather than artistic. 

3. His personality traits of being careful, talented and ambitious fit the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor.

However, I did not assign a probability of 1.0 because the description does not definitively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The 3:1 ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample also figures into my probability estimate, but does not by itself determine the outcome for this specific individual.
