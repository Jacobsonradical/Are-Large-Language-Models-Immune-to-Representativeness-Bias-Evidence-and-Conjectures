Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science background (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than the humanities. However, without more data on the overall distribution of traits between the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate.
