Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science and technical fields.

- His lack of enjoyment of drawing and writing, despite being creative, may point more towards technical rather than artistic/humanities pursuits.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75 out of 100 professors).

That said, these are generalizations and there are certainly humanities professors who enjoy math/coding and computer science professors who enjoy art/writing. More individual details would be needed to assign a confident probability.

If I had to estimate, I'd say there's perhaps a 60-70% chance Jason is a computer science professor based on the description. But this probability is not extremely high given the limited information.
