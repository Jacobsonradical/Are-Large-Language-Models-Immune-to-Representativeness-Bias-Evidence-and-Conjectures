Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more stereotypically associated with computer science than the humanities
- High ambition and not enjoying creative writing/drawing also fits more with a stereotypical computer science profile

That said, these are broad generalizations and there is certainly individual variation. Plenty of humanities professors may share these traits. And the description lacks information on his specific research focus or teaching, which would give a clearer indication.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on limited information and stereotypes. More details about Jason's specific academic work and intellectual interests would allow for a more definitive assessment.
