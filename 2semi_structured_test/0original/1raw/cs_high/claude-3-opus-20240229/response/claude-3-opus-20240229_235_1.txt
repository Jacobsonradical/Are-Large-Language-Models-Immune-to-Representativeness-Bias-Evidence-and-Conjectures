Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more specific details about Jason's academic background and research, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonable guess that Jason is a computer science professor, while allowing for the possibility he could be in the humanities.
