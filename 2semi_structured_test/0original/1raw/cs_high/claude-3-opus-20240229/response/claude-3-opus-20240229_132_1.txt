Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. It also notes that despite being creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more typical of humanities fields.

However, without more detailed information about the specific traits the study found to be associated with each group of professors, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably high likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor given his described interests, but acknowledges that additional data from the study would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
