Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His disinterest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Personality traits like being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious are common among successful academics in general, so they don't strongly sway the probability either way between computer science and humanities.

4. The sample includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so even before considering Jason's specific traits, there's a higher base probability that a randomly selected description would be of a computer science professor.
