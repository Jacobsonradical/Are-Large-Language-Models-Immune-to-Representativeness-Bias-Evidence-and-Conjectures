Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not being drawn to creative writing or drawing, combined with his other traits, seems more consistent with a typical profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, without more specific data on the distribution of these traits among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate.
