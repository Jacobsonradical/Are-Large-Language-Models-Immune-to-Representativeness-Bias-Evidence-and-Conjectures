Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typical interests and skills for computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a relatively high prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an informed guess based on limited information and stereotypical associations. Without more personalizing details, a definitive determination is impossible. But the description paints a profile that seems more consistent with a computer science background.
