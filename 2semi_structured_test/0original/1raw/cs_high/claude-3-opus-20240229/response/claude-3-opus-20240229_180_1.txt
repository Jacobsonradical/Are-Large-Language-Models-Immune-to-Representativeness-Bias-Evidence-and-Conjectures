Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typically associated with computer science professors than humanities professors, such as enjoying coding and math puzzles. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also points more towards computer science. However, without more details on the specific distribution of traits among the two groups of professors, there is still some uncertainty. The 0.75 probability reflects a reasonably strong leaning towards computer science given the description, while allowing for the possibility he could be one of the humanities professors.
