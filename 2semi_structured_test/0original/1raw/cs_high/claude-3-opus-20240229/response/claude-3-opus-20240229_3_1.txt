Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more consistent with a stereotypical profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, without more detailed information on the specific traits that differentiate the two groups in this particular sample, there is still some uncertainty in the estimate. The provided probability reflects an educated guess based on the available description.
