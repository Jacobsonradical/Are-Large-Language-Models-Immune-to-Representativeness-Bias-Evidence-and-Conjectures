Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem to align more closely with a typical profile of a computer science professor.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also seems more consistent with a computer science background than a humanities one. However, his other traits like being conservative, careful, talented and ambitious could apply to successful professors in many fields.

Without more specific information, I'll estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This reflects that while the description suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities one, there is still some uncertainty based on the limited data provided.
