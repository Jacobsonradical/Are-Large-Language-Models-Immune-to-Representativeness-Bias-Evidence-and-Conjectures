Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without more data on the specific personality traits that correlate with the two different groups of professors, I cannot say this with certainty. More context about the personality differences found between the computer science and humanities professors in the study would allow for a more precise estimate.
