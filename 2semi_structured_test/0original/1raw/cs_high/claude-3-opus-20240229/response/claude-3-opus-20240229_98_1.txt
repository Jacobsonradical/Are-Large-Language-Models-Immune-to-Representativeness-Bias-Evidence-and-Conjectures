From the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more typical of computer scientists than humanities professors
- Being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing seems to fit the profile of a computer scientist more than a humanities professor, who would often enjoy writing

At the same time, having five children at age 45 and being conservative and careful don't necessarily distinguish between the two fields. And the study included 3x as many CS professors as humanities professors in the sample.

Weighing the evidence, I'd estimate roughly a 75% chance that Jason is one of the computer science professors. But there's still a decent chance he could be one of the humanities professors.
