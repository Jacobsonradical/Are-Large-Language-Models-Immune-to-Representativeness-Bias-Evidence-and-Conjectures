Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as not enjoying drawing or writing, point more towards a computer science background. However, there is still some uncertainty, so I would not assign an extremely high probability like 0.9 or above. 0.75 reflects a reasonably high likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given his profile, while allowing for the possibility he could be one of the humanities professors.
