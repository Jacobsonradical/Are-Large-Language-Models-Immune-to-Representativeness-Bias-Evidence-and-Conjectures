Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward technical rather than artistic pursuits.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide conclusive evidence either way. Humanities professors can certainly also enjoy coding and math. And family details like being married with five children don't necessarily distinguish between the two groups.

Given there were 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate alone would suggest a 75% chance of Jason being a CS professor if no other information was known.

Weighing the above factors, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be somewhat higher than the base rate, but not with high confidence given the limited information. Here is my estimate:

{"probability": "0.8"}
