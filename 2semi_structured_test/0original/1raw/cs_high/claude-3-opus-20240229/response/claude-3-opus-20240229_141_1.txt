To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider the relevant information provided:

- The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more often associated with the humanities.

Using this information, we can reason that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

However, it's important to note that the description does not provide conclusive evidence, as there could be professors in the humanities who enjoy coding and math puzzles or computer science professors who enjoy drawing and writing.

Considering the available information and the fact that the sample included more computer science professors than humanities professors, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

This probability reflects the higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor based on his interests and the composition of the study sample, while acknowledging the uncertainty due to the limited information provided.
