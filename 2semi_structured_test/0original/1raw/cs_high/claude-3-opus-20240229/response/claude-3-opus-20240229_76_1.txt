Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more toward computer science than humanities.

That said, none of these traits are exclusive to computer scientists, and plenty of information that could change the assessment (like his specific research focus) is missing.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But I want to emphasize this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information. Much more data about Jason's background, research, publications, and personality would be needed to give a truly confident assessment of which field he likely specializes in. The nature of this study and the information provided is insufficient to draw a reliable conclusion.
