Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated more with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more often associated with the humanities.
- The sample contained 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors, so all else being equal, there's a 75% chance Jason is a computer science professor.

However, plenty of humanities professors also enjoy coding and math, and some computer scientists do enjoy creative writing. The description is quite limited to draw firm conclusions.

If I had to give a probability estimate based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat that this is a very rough estimate based on extremely limited information and stereotypical associations. Much more data would be needed to assign a probability with any real confidence.
