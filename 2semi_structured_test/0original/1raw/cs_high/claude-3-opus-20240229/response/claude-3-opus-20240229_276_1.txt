Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors.

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may be more technical/analytical rather than artistic/linguistic. 

- Computer science made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% humanities professors. So all else being equal, there's a higher prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

That said, none of these factors are definitive. Plenty of humanities professors may also enjoy coding and math puzzles. And the study methodology of personality tests administered by psychologists should ideally control for different base rates between the two groups.

So I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is moderately higher than him being a humanities professor, but far from certain given the information provided:

{"probability": "0.65"}
