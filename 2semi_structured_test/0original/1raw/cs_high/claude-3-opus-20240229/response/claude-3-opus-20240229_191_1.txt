Based on the description provided, I estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical interests for computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science than humanities. 

3. Ambitious and talented traits could apply to successful professors in both fields.

4. The sample included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so there is a higher prior probability of any randomly selected description being of a computer science professor.

However, without more specific information clearly distinguishing computer science vs. humanities interests and skills, I cannot give a probability higher than 0.75. The description is still potentially compatible with a humanities professor.
