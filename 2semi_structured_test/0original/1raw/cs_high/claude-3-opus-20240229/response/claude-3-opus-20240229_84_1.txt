Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.90"}

The key factors leading to this high probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests and skills among computer science professors.

2. He is described as highly creative, a trait often associated with successful computer scientists. 

3. While creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, suggesting his creativity manifests more in technical and analytical domains like computer science rather than in the humanities.

4. Ambitious and talented are traits that could apply to successful academics in any field, but combined with his specific interests, they point more towards computer science.

Of course, this is an estimated probability based on limited information and some general assumptions. Without more detailed data on the specific traits and their distribution among the two groups of professors, a definitive answer is not possible. But the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor in this sample.
