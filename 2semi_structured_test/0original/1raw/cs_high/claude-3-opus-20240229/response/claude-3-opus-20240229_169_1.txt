Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science more so than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, creative pursuits more commonly associated with the humanities.
- The sample size of computer science professors (75) is much larger than humanities professors (25), so there's a higher prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

That said, these are generalizations and humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding too. Conservatism, carefulness, talent and ambition are traits that could apply to successful professors in either field.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.7"}

But this probability is highly uncertain given the limited information to individuate Jason. More details about his specific research focus, publications, teaching, academic background, etc. would allow for a much more confident estimate.
