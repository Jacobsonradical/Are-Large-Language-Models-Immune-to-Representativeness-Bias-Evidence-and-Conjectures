Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, some of his characteristics and interests seem more aligned with a typical computer science background. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as not being drawn to creative arts like drawing and writing, suggest a more analytical and technical mindset. At the same time, these traits do not necessarily preclude him from being a humanities professor.

Given the breakdown of the sample (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), and Jason's described traits and interests, I would estimate the probability of him being a computer science professor as:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This reflects both the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample, and the apparent alignment of his profile with stereotypical computer science characteristics. However, I acknowledge this is a tentative estimate based on limited data about Jason and potential stereotyping. More details about his specific field, research focus and other factors would allow for a more definitive assessment.
