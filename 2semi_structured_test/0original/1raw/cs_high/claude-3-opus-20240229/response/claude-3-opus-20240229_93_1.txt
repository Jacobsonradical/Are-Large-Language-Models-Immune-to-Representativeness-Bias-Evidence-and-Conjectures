To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the relevant information provided in his description.

Factors suggesting Jason is a computer science professor:
1. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.
2. He is highly creative, a trait often associated with successful computer science researchers.

Factors suggesting Jason might not be a computer science professor:
1. The description does not explicitly mention his field of study or research.
2. Enjoying jogging and not enjoying drawing or writing do not provide strong evidence for either field.

Given the limited information, we must also consider the base rates provided in the study description. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, without any additional information, the probability of a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75.

Considering the base rates and the relevant factors in Jason's description that slightly favor him being a computer science professor, a reasonable estimate for the probability would be somewhat higher than 0.75.
