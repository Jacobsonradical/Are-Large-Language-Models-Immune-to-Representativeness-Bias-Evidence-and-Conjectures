Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, a few clues point towards him more likely being a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of interest in creative pursuits like drawing and writing, despite being described as highly creative, also fits more with a computer science than humanities profile.

- Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample. So statistically, any given profile has a higher prior probability of being a computer science professor.

However, nothing in the description definitively identifies Jason as a computer science professor. Conservative, careful, talented and ambitious individuals can be found in both disciplines. And a love of jogging doesn't particularly distinguish the fields.

Weighing the limited evidence, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor at 70%. But this is a tentative assessment given the information provided.
