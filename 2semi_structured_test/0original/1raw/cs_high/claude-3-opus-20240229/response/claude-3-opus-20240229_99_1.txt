Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description of Jason enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, while not enjoying drawing or writing, seems more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Computer science often involves mathematical and programming skills.

However, without more detailed information on the relative proportions of these traits in the two groups of professors, I cannot give a precise probability - only an informed estimate based on the description seeming more characteristic of the computer science group which makes up 75% of the overall sample. More details on the study methodology and results would be needed for a rigorous probability estimate.
