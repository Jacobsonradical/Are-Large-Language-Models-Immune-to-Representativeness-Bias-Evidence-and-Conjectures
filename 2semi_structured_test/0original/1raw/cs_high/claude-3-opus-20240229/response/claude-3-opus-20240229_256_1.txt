To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The person is a computer science professor
B: The person's description matches Jason's

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more often associated with the humanities.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Assumptions:
- Let's assume that the probability of a computer science professor having a description like Jason's is 0.6 (P(B|A) = 0.6).
- The probability of a humanities professor having a description like Jason's is 0.2 (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

Calculations:
P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75 (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
P(not A) = 25/100 = 0.25 (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.6 * 0.75 +
