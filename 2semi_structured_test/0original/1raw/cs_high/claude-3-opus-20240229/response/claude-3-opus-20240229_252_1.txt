Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards technical rather than artistic pursuits.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75% were CS professors).

Without more definitive information about his specific field, a precise probability is hard to give. But considering there were 3 times as many CS professors in the sample, and Jason's hobbies align more with computer science, I'd estimate:

{"probability": "0.75"}

This reflects the base rate of CS professors in the sample, with some upward adjustment for the CS-leaning details provided. But more specific information about Jason's academic field and research would be needed to assign a probability with strong confidence.
