Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. The study sample included 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. With no other distinguishing information, this 3:1 ratio alone would imply a 75% prior probability of any randomly selected description being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is an estimated probability based on limited information. More details about Jason's specific research focus, publications, and academic background would allow for a more precise assessment. But given the provided description, a 75% probability seems reasonable.
