Based on the limited information provided, it's challenging to determine with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 

- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points slightly more towards computer science rather than humanities.

At the same time, the other details provided about Jason (his age, marital status, number of children, and personality traits) seem fairly neutral and don't clearly indicate his academic field one way or the other.

Given the information available, I'd estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be moderately higher than the prior probability based on the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the sample. But I don't have enough strong distinguishing information to skew the probability dramatically in either direction.
