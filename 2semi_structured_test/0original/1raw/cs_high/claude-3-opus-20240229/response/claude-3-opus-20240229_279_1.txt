Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest a somewhat higher probability that he is a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- The description notes Jason is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, again pointing more towards technical/analytical creativity vs artistic/literary creativity.
- Computer science professors made up 75% of the overall sample, so there's a higher prior probability of any randomly selected profile being a CS professor.

That said, the other personal details provided like his age, marital status, number of children, and jogging hobby seem largely independent of his field. And certainly there can be humanities professors who code and solve math puzzles in their free time. 

So while the limited evidence points to a somewhat higher probability of Jason being a computer science professor, I don't think it's overwhelmingly conclusive. As a rough estimate, I'd say:

{"probability": "0.65"}
