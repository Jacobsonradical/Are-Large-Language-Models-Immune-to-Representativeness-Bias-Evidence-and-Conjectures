Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typically associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing despite being creative, again suggesting more of an inclination towards computer science.

3. The fact that there were 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors in the sample, so even before considering Jason's specific traits, there would be a 75% prior probability of him being a computer science professor.

Of course, this is still just an estimate based on limited information. Personality traits and interests don't perfectly determine one's academic field. But considering the numerical distribution of the sample and the described characteristics, a 75% probability seems reasonable to me.
