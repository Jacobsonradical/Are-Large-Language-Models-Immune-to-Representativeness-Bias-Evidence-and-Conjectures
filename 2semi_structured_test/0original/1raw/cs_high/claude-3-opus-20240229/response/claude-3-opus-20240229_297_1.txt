Based on the given description of Jason, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors leading to this probability estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

2. His lack of interest in drawing or writing, despite being highly creative, suggests he is more likely to be in a technical field like computer science rather than the humanities.

3. Computer science professors made up 75% of the sample, so even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not definitively confirm Jason's profession, and there could be some humanities professors with similar traits and interests.
