Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more likely in a STEM field than the humanities. 

3. Computer science had a larger representation in the sample compared to humanities (75 vs 25).

However, there is still some uncertainty, as the description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and there can be individual differences and overlap in traits between the two groups. The 0.8 probability reflects a high likelihood of him being a computer science professor based on the available information, while allowing for the possibility he could be in the humanities group.
