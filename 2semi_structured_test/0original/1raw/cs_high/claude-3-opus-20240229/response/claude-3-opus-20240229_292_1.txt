Based on the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The description suggests Jason has traits and interests that seem more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor, such as enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles. However, without more data on the overall distribution of traits among the two groups, there is still some uncertainty. The provided probability reflects an educated guess based on the available information, while acknowledging it is not definitive.
