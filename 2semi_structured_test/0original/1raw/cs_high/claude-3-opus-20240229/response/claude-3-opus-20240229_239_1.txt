Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to say with high confidence whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with typical interests of computer science professors
- His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests his creativity may lie more in technical/analytical domains rather than artistic ones
- Computer science made up 75% of the sample vs only 25% being humanities professors

That said, none of these factors are definitive. Humanities professors can certainly enjoy math and coding, and many factors like his conservatism, ambition, family status, and jogging are likely not strongly predictive either way.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the limited information provided, I would say:

{"probability": "0.65"}

But I want to caveat that this probability estimate is highly uncertain given the limited information to go on. More details about his specific research focuses, educational background, and other factors would allow for a more confident assessment.
