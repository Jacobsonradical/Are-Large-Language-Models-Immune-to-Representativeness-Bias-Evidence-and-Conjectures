Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say definitively whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, a few details suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. 
- Despite being creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, artistic pursuits that may be more common among humanities professors.

At the same time, the description doesn't provide Jason's actual field, and many of the other traits and biographical details could apply to a professor in either discipline.

If I had to estimate a probability based solely on the description provided, I would say there is a somewhat higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor than a humanities professor, given the 3:1 ratio of CS to humanities professors in the overall sample and the mention of CS-related hobbies. However, I don't have enough information to assign a very high probability.

My estimate would be:

{"probability": "0.6"}
