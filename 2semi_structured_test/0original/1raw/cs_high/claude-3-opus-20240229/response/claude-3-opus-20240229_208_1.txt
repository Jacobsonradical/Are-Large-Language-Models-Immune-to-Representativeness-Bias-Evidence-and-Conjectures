Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor. However, there are a few clues that suggest he may be more likely to be a computer science professor:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with computer science and related technical fields. 

- His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, may indicate his creativity manifests more in technical rather than artistic pursuits.

- Computer science had a larger representation in the study sample (75% of participants).

Without more definitive information about his profession and academic background, I'd estimate the probability Jason is a computer science professor to be:

{"probability": "0.7"}

This reflects that the description suggests a lean towards computer science, but acknowledges the inherent uncertainty given the limited information. More details about his specific research focus, academic department, publications, etc. would allow for a more definitive assessment.
