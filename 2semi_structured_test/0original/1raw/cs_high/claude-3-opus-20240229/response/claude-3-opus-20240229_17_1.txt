Based on the given description, my estimate is:

{"probability": "0.80"}

The key factors influencing this probability estimate are:

1. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science than humanities.

2. His dislike for drawing and writing despite being creative, suggesting a preference for technical rather than artistic pursuits. 

3. The study's sample composition, with 75% being computer science professors. Even without additional information, there would be a 75% prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.

However, there is still some uncertainty as the description does not definitively state Jason's profession, and individuals can have diverse interests and personalities that deviate from stereotypes associated with their field. The 0.80 probability reflects a high likelihood based on the given information, while acknowledging the possibility that Jason could be one of the humanities professors.
