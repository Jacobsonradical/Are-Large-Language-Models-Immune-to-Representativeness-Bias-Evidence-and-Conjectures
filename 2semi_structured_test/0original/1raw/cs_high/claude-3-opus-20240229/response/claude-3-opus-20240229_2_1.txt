Based on the given description, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. His lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, despite being creative, also points more towards computer science rather than humanities. 

3. Computer science had a larger representation in the sample (75 out of 100), so there's a higher base rate probability of a randomly selected profile being from that group.

However, I did not assign a probability higher than 0.75 because the description does not conclusively rule out the possibility of Jason being a humanities professor. The personality traits and demographic information provided are not necessarily exclusive to computer science professors.
