Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.8"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically associated with computer science.

2. His lack of interest in drawing and writing, despite being creative, suggests he is more technically than artistically inclined. 

3. Computer science professors likely outnumbered humanities professors 3 to 1 in the overall sample (75 vs 25).

However, without more definitive information directly relating Jason's background and skill set to computer science, I cannot be certain he is a computer science professor, hence an 80% probability estimate rather than a near-certain probability above 90%.
