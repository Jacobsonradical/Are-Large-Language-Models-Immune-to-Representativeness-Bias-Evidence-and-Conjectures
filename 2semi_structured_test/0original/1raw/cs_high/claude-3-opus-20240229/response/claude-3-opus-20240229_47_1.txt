Based on the description provided, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}

The key factors influencing my estimate are:

1. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities.

2. The description mentions Jason's talent and ambition, traits that are likely common among successful academics in both fields. 

3. Jason is described as conservative and careful, personality traits that could apply to successful professors in either discipline.

4. While Jason is described as highly creative, his disinterest in drawing and writing suggests his creativity may be more suited to technical and scientific pursuits rather than artistic ones often associated with the humanities.

Given the limited information, there is still some uncertainty, but the mentioned hobbies of coding and math puzzles are the strongest indicators pointing to a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor in this sample.
