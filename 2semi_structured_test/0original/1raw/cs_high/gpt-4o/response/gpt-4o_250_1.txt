To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here, we are given information about Jason's characteristics and we want to find the probability that he belongs to the computer science group rather than the humanities group based on these characteristics.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science \( P(CS) \) is 75/100 or 0.75.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities \( P(H) \) is 25/100 or 0.25.

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- Given Jason's characteristics (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing), it is more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Letâ€™s assume \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively
