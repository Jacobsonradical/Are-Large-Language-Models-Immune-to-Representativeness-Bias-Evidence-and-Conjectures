Given the description of Jason:

- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

We are tasked with determining whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor from the given sample.

First, let's analyze the basic probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability (base rate) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we consider the description. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles and does not enjoy drawing or writing, these traits are more stereotypically associated with computer science rather than the humanities.

Using Bayesian reasoning and considering that the description strongly fits the profile of a computer science professor, we can update our prior probability accordingly. Given the strong fit with the computer science profile, we can surmise that Jason is highly likely to be a computer science professor.

Therefore, the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is very high.
