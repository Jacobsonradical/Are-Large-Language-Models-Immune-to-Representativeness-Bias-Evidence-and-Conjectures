Given the description of Jason and the details provided, the task is to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, as opposed to a humanities professor, based on his interests and personality traits.

First, consider the base rates of the two groups:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Given these base rates alone:
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, evaluate the description against typical stereotypes or traits of each group:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with the interests typically associated with computer science professors.
- His lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are activities more associated with humanities professors, further supports the idea that he is a computer science professor.

Given these observations and prior probabilities (base rates), the updated probability is highly skewed towards him being a computer science professor. Therefore, considering both the base rates and the description:

{"probability": "0.9"}
