{"probability": "0.75"}

Since Jason's description includes activities and traits that are more commonly associated with computer science (such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles), and because there are more computer science professors than humanities professors in the sample, there is a higher likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

To quantify this:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The ratio of computer science to humanities professors is 75:25, meaning there's a 3:1 ratio.
Therefore, the probability can be estimated as 75/(75+25) = 75/100 = 0.75.
