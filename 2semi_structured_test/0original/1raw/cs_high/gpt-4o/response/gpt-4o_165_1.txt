Given the description provided for Jason, we have to infer the likelihood that he belongs to either the group of computer science professors or humanities professors. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in our sample.

Given the traits:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with computer science.
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities.

These traits suggest a stronger alignment with the profile of a computer science professor. To quantify this:

1. The base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
2. The base rate probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given Jason's description, it's reasonable to assign greater weight to the base rate for computer science faculty because his activities align more closely with the typical interests of a computer science professor.

Given these factors, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is relatively high.
