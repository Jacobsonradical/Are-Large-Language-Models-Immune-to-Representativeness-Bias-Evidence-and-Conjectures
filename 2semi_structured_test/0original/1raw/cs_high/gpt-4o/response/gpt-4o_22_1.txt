To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

First, we identify the given probabilities:

- Prior probability of someone being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Prior probability of someone being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \):
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of H professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's assign probabilities based on Jason's description. Given the qualities and interests described, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is more likely (subjectively) that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- Probability of Jason's description given CS professor, \( P(D|CS) \), is high, let's say 0.9.
- Probability of Jason's description given H professor, \( P(D|H) \), is lower, let's assume 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can update these probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cd
