Given the description of Jason, several aspects suggest that he fits the profile of a computer science professor more closely than a humanities professor:

- Enjoys coding: This is a strong indicator as it is directly associated with computer science.
- Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles: This is often more associated with the analytical skills required in computer science.
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing: Creativity is important in all fields, but dislike for drawing or writing could be less common in the humanities where these skills are often more central.

Given these strong indicators, in addition to the base rate (75 computer science professors out of 100), we can adjust our probability accordingly.

Using Bayesian reasoning, where we start with a prior probability based on the base rates and then update this based on the likelihood of the provided evidence, we might initially assign:

- Prior probability for being a computer science professor: 75/100 = 0.75
- Prior probability for being a humanities professor: 25/100 = 0.25

Considering the given description aligns strongly with the characteristics associated with computer science, we update our belief and assign a higher posterior probability to the proposition that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given these considerations, we can reasonably assign a high probability to Jason being a computer science professor.

Therefore:
{"probability": "0.95"}
