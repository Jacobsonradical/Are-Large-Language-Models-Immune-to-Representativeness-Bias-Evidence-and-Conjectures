Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, and based on the description provided, it appears that Jason's interests and traits (e.g., enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with those of a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing further suggests a tilt towards computer science rather than the humanities. 

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem, incorporating the base rates of each group:

1. The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
2. The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor is \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given the description of Jason, we need to assess the likelihood that someone with his profile is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)) versus a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)). 

We assume that Jason's description fits much better with a computer science professor due to his interests in coding and mathematical puzzles. Although we don't have precise likelihoods, intuitively assigning higher likelihood to \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) makes sense. 

Thus, our updating formula is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\
