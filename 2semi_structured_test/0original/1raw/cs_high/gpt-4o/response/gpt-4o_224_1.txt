{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning behind the probability:

1. **Base Rate**: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So the base probability of Jason being a computer science professor, before considering other information, is 75/100 or 0.75.

2. **Description Details**: Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing) are more commonly associated with computer science professionals than with humanities professionals.

Combining the base rate and the alignment of Jason's attributes with typical characteristics of computer science professors, the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor appears high. Hence, the probability is 0.75.
