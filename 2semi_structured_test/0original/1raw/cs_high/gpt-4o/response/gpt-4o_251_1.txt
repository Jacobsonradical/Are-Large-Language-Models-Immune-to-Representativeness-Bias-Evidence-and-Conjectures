{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability estimate takes into account the base rate of the two groups: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Given Jason's interests and personality traits that align more closely with typical characteristics and hobbies of computer science professors, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, the probability of him being one of the computer science professors is higher. However, it is not certain, so a balanced yet informative probability of 0.75 is given.
