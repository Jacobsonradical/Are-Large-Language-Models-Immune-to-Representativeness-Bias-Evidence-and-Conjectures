Given the description of Jason, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor.

First, we need to establish our priors, which are the baseline probabilities that a randomly chosen person from the sample is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we need to account for the likelihood evidence provided by the description of Jason. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with typical interests and activities in computer science than in the humanities. Therefore, we can assume that the likelihood (P(Description | CS)) is higher for computer science professors than for humanities professors.

- Let's assume that the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor is high, e.g., P(Description | CS) = 0.9.
- Also, let's assume that the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor is low, e.g., P(Description | H) = 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{
