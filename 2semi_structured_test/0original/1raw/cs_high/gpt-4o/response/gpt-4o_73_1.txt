The base rates for the two groups in the study are as follows:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, the base probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason seems to align more closely with the typical interests and traits associated with computer science professors than humanities professors, given his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. This alignment with the typical traits of computer science professors increases the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given this information, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be adjusted upward from the base rate. Let's assume, taking into consideration how closely the description matches what one would expect from a computer science professor, the adjusted probability might be around 0.9.
