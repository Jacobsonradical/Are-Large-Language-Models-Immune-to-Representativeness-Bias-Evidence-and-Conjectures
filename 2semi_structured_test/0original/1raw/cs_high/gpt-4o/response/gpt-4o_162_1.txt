Given the description, we should consider both the prior distribution of the two groups of professors and the likelihood based on Jason's traits. 

Let's start with the prior probabilities:
- Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now consider the description of Jason:
- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science professors.
- Since no specific traits related to the humanities are mentioned and he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be considered more characteristic of a humanities professor, we can infer that it is more likely that he is from the computer science group.

With this context, we can apply Bayes' theorem informally to update our probabilities, heavily favoring the computer science group:

- Given the strong alignment of Jason's interests with those typical of a computer science professor, we would adjust the probability towards the computer science group.

Therefore, the output can be written as:
```json
{"probability": "0.95"}
