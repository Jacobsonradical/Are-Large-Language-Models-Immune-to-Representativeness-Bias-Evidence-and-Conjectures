Based on the descriptions provided, Jason's interests and traits such as enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. 

Considering the proportions, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, leading to a distribution ratio of 3:1.

Here is the calculation to determine the probability:

1. **Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)) =** 75/100 = 0.75
2. **Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)) =** 25/100 = 0.25 

Given Jason's interests and traits, we might think that these are more common among computer science professors. Without exact likelihood values, but assuming Jason's profile is distinctly more probable for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor, we consider a subjective high likelihood favoring CS given the profile:

Assume P(profile | CS) = 0.9 and P(profile | H) = 0.1 for simplicity.

To find the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(CS | profile) = [ P(profile | CS) * P(CS) ] / [ P(profile | CS) * P(CS) + P(profile | H) * P(H) ]

Plugging in the values:

P(CS | profile) = (0.9 * 0.75) / (0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25) 
                = 0.675 / (0.675 + 0.025) 
                = 0.
