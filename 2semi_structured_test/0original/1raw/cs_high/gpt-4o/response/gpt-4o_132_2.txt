{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: 

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, if we do not take any other information into account, the base probability of picking a computer science professor at random is 75/100 = 0.75.

Jason's description includes interests and traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science than the humanities. Therefore, this additional information supports the idea that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

Thus, it is reasonable to maintain the base probability of 0.75 after considering the provided description.
