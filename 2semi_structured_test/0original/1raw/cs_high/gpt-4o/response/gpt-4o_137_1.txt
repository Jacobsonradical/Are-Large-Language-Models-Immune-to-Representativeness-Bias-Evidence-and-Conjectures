To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \): The probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | H) \): The probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \): The overall probability of the given description.

First, let's assume that there's no bias in selecting the professors for interviews, thus:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | H) \). Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align more closely with typical characteristics of computer science professors, we can assume:

- \( P(Desc | CS) \): High (let's assume around 0.9 based on the given information).
- \( P(Desc | H) \): Low (let's assume around 0.1 based on the given information).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)
