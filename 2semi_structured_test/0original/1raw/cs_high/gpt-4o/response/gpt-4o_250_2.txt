{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is based on the prior probability (base rates) of the two groups (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors) and the additional specific information provided about Jason. The traits and interests described (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with the profile of a computer science professor. Hence, the higher probability is assigned to Jason being a computer science professor.
