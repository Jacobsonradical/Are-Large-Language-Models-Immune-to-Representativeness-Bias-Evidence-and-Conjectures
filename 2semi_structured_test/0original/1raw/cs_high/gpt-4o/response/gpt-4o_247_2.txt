Given the details of the study, we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Assuming we have no prior biases about Jason's field other than the description provided, we initially might use the base rates, which are:
- Probability of picking a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of picking a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is 25/100 = 0.25

Based on the description, we need to examine if Jason's traits are more consistent with those expected of a computer science professor or a humanities professor. The traits he exhibits—enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—strongly suggest a background in computer science given the specific mention of coding.

Using Bayesian reasoning, we can reason that the likelihood of a computer science professor enjoying coding is substantially high compared to a humanities professor. Therefore, the description provides a strong indication that Jason is more likely to be one of the computer science professors. 

Using this qualitative assessment:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(P(CS | description)\)) significantly outweighs the baseline 0.75 due to the fit of his interests with those typically found in computer science.

For a more substantial numerical estimate, let's assume:
- The likelihood Jason's description matches a computer science professor (\(P(description | CS)\)) is very high, perhaps 0.95.
- The likelihood Jason's description matches a humanities professor (\(P(description | H)\)) is presumably low, perhaps 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \
