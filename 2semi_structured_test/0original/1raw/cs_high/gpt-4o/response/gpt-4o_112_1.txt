To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem involves understanding the prior probabilities and updating them with the likelihoods of observing the given evidence under each hypothesis.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - Probability that a professor is from Computer Science (\(P(\text{CS})\)):
    \[
    P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]
    - Probability that a professor is from Humanities (\(P(\text{Humanities})\)):
    \[
    P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Computer Science professor (\(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\)).
    - Similarly, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Humanities professor (\(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})\)).

Given the description of Jason's interests and characteristics, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these traits are more commonly associated with someone in computer science rather than humanities. Although we don't have exact numbers to compute these likelihoods, we can reasonably estimate:

\[
P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \gg P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})
\]

3. **Bayesian Update:**
    Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
    \[
    P(\text{CS}|\text{Description
