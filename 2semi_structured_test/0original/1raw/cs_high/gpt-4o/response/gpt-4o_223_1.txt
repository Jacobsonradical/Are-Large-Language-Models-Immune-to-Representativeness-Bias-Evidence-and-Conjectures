{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning behind the probability:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so without any additional information, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75 and for a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. The description of Jason includes several traits and interests that are more commonly associated with computer science professors: enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (a trait that does not have a strong correlation with either field but does not sway the analysis much).

Based on this combination of factors, and sticking to Bayesian reasoning by adapting the prior probabilities slightly towards the evidence provided by the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains strongly in favor of the 0.75 figure.

Thus, the calculated probability Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
