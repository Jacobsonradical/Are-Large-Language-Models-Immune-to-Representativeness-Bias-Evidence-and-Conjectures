To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given his description, we need to consider both the base rate of computer science versus humanities professors and the likelihood of those traits given each profession.

Here’s how we can approach the calculation:

1. **Base Rate (Prior Probability):**
   - Number of computer science professors = 75
   - Number of humanities professors = 25
   - Total professors = 100
   - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, P(CS), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, P(H), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood (Conditional Probability):**
   - Given Jason’s traits - enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it seems more likely these traits are associated with a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.
   
3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   We use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief based on Jason’s description:

\[ P(CS | \text{Jason’s description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason’s description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Jason’s description})} \]

However, we don't have exact likelihood values \( P(\text{Jason’s description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{Jason’s description} | H) \). Based on the description, let’s assume the likelihood of such a description coming from a computer science professor is significantly higher compared to a humanities professor. 

For the sake of simplicity and based on the fact
