Given that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 total:

1. Initially, without any additional information, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. Now we take into account the description of Jason. The description includes several characteristics that are likely to be more common in computer science professors than humanities professors:
   - Enjoys coding.
   - Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles.
   - Despite high creativity, does not enjoy writing or drawing (activities perhaps more typical for humanities professors).

The fact that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor. Considering this additional information, we might revise upward from our initial probability of 0.75.

The information given is highly indicative of a computer science background, so it would be reasonable to assign Jason an even higher likelihood of being a computer science professor than the base rate of 0.75. We might estimate this revised probability intuitively based on how strongly the individual characteristics correlate with the likelihood of being in either field.

After consideration, a reasonable probability might be:

{"probability": "0.95"}
