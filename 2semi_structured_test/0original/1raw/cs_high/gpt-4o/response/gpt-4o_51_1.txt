{"probability": "0.75"}

To arrive at this number, consider the base rates of the two groups. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving a base rate ratio of 75:25, or in probability terms, 0.75 (computer science) and 0.25 (humanities). The description of Jason includes preferences and activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) that align more closely with computer science. The probability estimate is thus adjusted toward the base rate for computer science professors.
