Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, his interests and personality traits seem to align more closely with those typically associated with computer science professors, primarily due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Hereâ€™s how the probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior Probabilities** (base rates):
   - Probability of a professor being from Computer Science, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of a professor being from Humanities, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Likelihood that Jason's profile fits a Computer Science professor, \( P(Profile \mid CS) \), is relatively high based on the description.
   - Likelihood that Jason's profile fits a Humanities professor, \( P(Profile \mid H) \), is relatively low based on the description.

Given the strong alignment of Jason's profile with the typical traits of a computer science professor, let's estimate:

- \( P(Profile \mid CS) \approx 0.90 \)
- \( P(Profile \mid H) \approx 0.10 \)

3. **Bayes' Theorem Calculation**:
\[
P(CS \mid Profile) = \frac{P(Profile \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Profile \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Profile \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(CS \mid Profile) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{
