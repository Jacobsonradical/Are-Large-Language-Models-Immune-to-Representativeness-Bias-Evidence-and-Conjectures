{"probability": "0.75"}

Since the study has 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a priori, any randomly chosen professor is more likely (3 times more likely) to be from computer science. Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, this matches the profile of a computer science professor quite well. This raises his probability further, although itâ€™s not definitive. Hence, combining both the prior probability and the clues from his description, 0.75 is a reasonable estimation.
