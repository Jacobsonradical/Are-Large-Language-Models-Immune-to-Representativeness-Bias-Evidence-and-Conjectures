Given the description of Jason, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that he is a computer science professor. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Prob(Jason is a computer science professor) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Prob(Jason is a humanities professor) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The description of Jason seems more closely aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
   - Suppose the likelihood of a computer science professor matching Jason's description is quite high, say 0.8.
   - Suppose the likelihood of a humanities professor matching Jason's description is quite low, say 0.2.
   
3. **Bayesian Calculation:**
   We apply Bayes' theorem which states:

   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]

   Here, \( A \) is "Jason is a computer science professor" and \( B \) is "Jason matches the given description".

   We need \( P(B) \):

   \[
   P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
   \]
