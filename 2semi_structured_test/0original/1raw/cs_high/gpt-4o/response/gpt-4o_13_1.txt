{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. The description of Jason emphasizes interests and activities more commonly associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities. Despite the description aligning more closely with typical computer science traits, we still must consider the prior distribution. Given the initial imbalance of 75 to 25 (i.e., 3 to 1 ratio in favor of computer science), the probability of Jason being a computer science professor reflects this ratio. Thus, the probability is calculated as 75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75.
