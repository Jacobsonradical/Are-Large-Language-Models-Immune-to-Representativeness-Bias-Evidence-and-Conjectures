Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, we need to consider both the base rates of the two groups (computer science professors and humanities professors) and the traits described to estimate the probability.

Firstly, the base rate of computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
\frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
and for humanities professors:
\[
\frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Jason's traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging lean more towards characteristics typically associated with computer science professors rather than humanities professors. Moreover, his disinterest in drawing or writing also aligns more with a computer science background.

Using Bayesian reasoning, we combine the prior probabilities (the base rates) with the likelihood of observing these traits in each group. Given the base rate dominance and the strong alignment of Jason's interests and traits with computer science, we can reasonably estimate a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable probability estimate is:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: 0.95
\]

So, the final answer is:
\{
"probability": 0.95
\}
