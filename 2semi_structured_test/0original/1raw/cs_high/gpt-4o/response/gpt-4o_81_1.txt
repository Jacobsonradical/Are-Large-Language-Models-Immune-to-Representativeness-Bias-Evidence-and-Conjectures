Given the description and considering the sample sizes and the characteristics of the professors from both disciplines, we first need to consider the likelihood based on the data available:

1. The total number of professors sampled is 100, with 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities.
2. The personality description fits more closely with common stereotypes or typical interests of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than those of a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem for conditional probability:
- P(CS) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(HUM) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Description|CS) = Probability that a computer science professor has Jason’s description = estimated higher due to fitting interests
- P(Description|HUM) = Probability that a humanities professor has Jason’s description = estimated lower due to less fitting interests
- P(Description) = General probability of the description = Sum of the probabilities weighted by their corresponding population proportions

Since P(Description|CS) is likely much higher than P(Description|HUM), we can reasonably update our prior belief heavily in favor of Jason being a computer science professor. This leads us to:

{"probability": "0.9"}
