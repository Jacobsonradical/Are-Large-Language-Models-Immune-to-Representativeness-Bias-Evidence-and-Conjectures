{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the base rate of professors in the sample (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities, giving a base rate of 0.75 for computer science). Given Jason's interests and personality traits such as enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, though this does not entirely rule out the possibility that he could be from the humanities.
