{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, which includes enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with a conservative and careful personality, it is more likely that he is one of the computer science professors. The fact that there are three times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25) in the sample also tilts the probability in favor of him being from computer science. However, without additional specific information completely ruling out the possibility of his career in humanities, we can assign a higher, but not definitive, probability.
