{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the information about Jason's interests and traits, it seems more likely that he aligns with the profile of a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, typical activities associated with computer science, strongly supports this inference. However, without additional context about how common these traits are within each field, this assessment is based on the presented description and a basic understanding of typical activities within computer science and the humanities. Considering the initial sample sizes (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), the probability can be adjusted accordingly. The larger sample size of the computer science group further tilts the probability towards him likely being a computer science professor.
