Given the description of Jason, who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is highly probable that he is one of the computer science professors. Both interests are strongly aligned with the typical activities and interests of individuals in the field of computer science.

Considering the sample composition—75 professors from computer science and 25 from humanities—as well as Jason’s specific traits and interests, the calculation can be further refined. Bayesian reasoning will help here. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (before considering any personal characteristics) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \). The likelihood that a professor with the described traits is in computer science is very high, given the coding and mathematical puzzles aspect.

Given this reasoning, I estimate the probability to be strongly in favor of Jason being a computer science professor. However, I would be cautious to give a precise objective probability due to not knowing the exact proportion of people with such specific traits in each field. Therefore, based on the description and reasoning, a solid, informed estimation can be given.
