Based on the description provided, certain traits and interests (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are often more closely associated with the field of computer science. Although personality traits alone are not definitive identifiers of a specific academic discipline, the provided clues suggest a higher likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor.

Given:
- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in the humanities

By taking into account the prior probabilities:  
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]  
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And considering the description specifics that align more with computer science interests, I will adjust the probability somewhat higher in favor of computer science.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors can be reasonably set as:

{"probability": "0.9"}
