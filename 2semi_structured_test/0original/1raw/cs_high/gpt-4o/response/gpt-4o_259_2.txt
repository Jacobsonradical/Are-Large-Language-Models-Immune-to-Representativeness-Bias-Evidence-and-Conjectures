To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must utilize Bayes' theorem. Here is the information we have:

- There are 75 computer science professors (CSP) and 25 humanities professors (HP).
- We need to find P(CSP|D), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(CSP|D) = \frac{P(D|CSP) \times P(CSP)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CSP) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(HP) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor.

We assume that Jason's interests and traits are more representative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, given his enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles. Letâ€™s denote:
- \( P(D|CSP) = 0.9 \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|HP) = 0.1 \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CSP) \times P(CSP) + P(D|HP) \times P(HP) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 +
