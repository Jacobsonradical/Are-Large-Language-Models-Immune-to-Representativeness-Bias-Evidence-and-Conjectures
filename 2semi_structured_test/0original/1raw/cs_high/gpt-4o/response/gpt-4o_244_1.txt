{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the fact that Jason's interests and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor, and that there are three times as many computer science professors in the sample as there are humanities professors. Given this information, the probability he is among the computer science professors is 0.75.
