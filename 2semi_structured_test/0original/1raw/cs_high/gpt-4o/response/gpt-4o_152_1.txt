{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
Given that we have a sample consisting of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the probability of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science is 75/100. However, considering Jasonâ€™s description, which highly aligns with attributes more typical of computer science professors (interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing), we can reasonably infer that Jason is more likely to be one of the computer science professors. Thus, factoring this informed inclination, the probability is approximately 0.75.
