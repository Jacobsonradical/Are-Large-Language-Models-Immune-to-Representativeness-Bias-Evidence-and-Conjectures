Given the information provided, we need to balance the base rate (the initial proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample) with the description of Jason's interests and personality traits.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the ratio of computer science to humanities professors 3:1. Therefore, the base rate probability P(CS) of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75, and the base rate probability P(Hum) of Jason being a humanities professor is 0.25.

The description provides additional specific information that is more characteristic of a computer science professor (e.g., interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and less characteristic of a humanities professor. Thus, we would update our probability estimate considering both the base rate and the descriptive match.

Using this combined reasoning (Bayesian updating), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is very high. While exact calculations aren't presented here, the description strongly fits a computer science profile, and maintaining the relative sample sizes in mind:

{"probability": "0.95"}
