{"probability": "0.75"}

To determine this probability, I used the information given about Jason and compared it to the typical characteristics and hobbies of professors in both the computer science and humanities fields.

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, giving prior probabilities of 0.75 and 0.25, respectively.
2. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science.
3. Although creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities often linked with the humanities.

Based on these factors, I have assigned a higher probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
