{"probability": "0.75"}

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and fits traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious) that might commonly be associated with computer science professors, there seems to be a higher likelihood that he is one of the computer science professors. Additionally, the larger sample size of computer science professors (75) compared to humanities professors (25) further increases the probability. Hence, combining these factors leads me to 75% probability (0.75).
