{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, several factors (such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with the profile of a computer science professor. With 75 computer science professors in the sample compared to 25 humanities professors, Bayesian reasoning would also favor the likelihood that Jason belongs to the larger group. Therefore, the probability is estimated at 0.75.
