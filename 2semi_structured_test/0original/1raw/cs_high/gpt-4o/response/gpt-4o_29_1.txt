Given the description of Jason, it is reasonable to use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors, called P(CS | Description), where CS represents computer science.

We start with the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is calculated based on the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is 100.

So, the prior probability P(CS) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability P(H) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the description of Jason. Characteristics such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more typical of a computer science professor, whereas humanities professors are less likely to have these specific interests.

Since we do not have the specific data on the exact likelihood of these traits belonging to computer science versus humanities professors, we can make a reasonable assumption that the likelihood of these characteristics given that Jason is a computer science professor, P(Description | CS), is higher compared to the likelihood of these characteristics given that he is a humanities professor, P(Description | H).

Let's assume the following likelihoods for the sake of this example:
- P(Description | CS) is quite high, say 0.9.
- P(
