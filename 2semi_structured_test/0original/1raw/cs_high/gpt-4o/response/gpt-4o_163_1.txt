Given the base rates of the samples, you have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(Hum) \) as the prior probability that a professor is from the humanities, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability that a description like Jason's would belong to a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) as the probability that a description like Jason's would belong to a humanities professor.

To compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Jason's activities and traits (such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles) strongly align with the typical interests and characteristics of computer science professors. Therefore, we could reasonably assume that:

\[ P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|Hum) \].

Without exact figures for these probabilities, a reasonable estimation, based on the strong fit of Jason's profile with computer science characteristics, might still yield a high probability favor
