To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we need to consider both base rates and specific descriptive information.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we use the description of Jason and consider if it fits more with the profile of a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Description of Jason:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- Conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing.

The traits and hobbies listed (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) strongly align with the typical profile of a computer science professor more than that of a humanities professor. To incorporate Bayesian updating using this descriptive information without specific likelihood values, we qualitatively determine that Jason's profile strongly fits computer science. Thus, we update our prior probability, heavily favoring that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given the strong alignment with the computer science profile, the posterior probability (P(CS|Description)) will be significantly higher than the prior. In Bayesian terms, the likelihood of the description given computer science would be much higher compared to the likelihood of the same description given humanities.

Therefore, updating yields a probability significantly higher than the prior of 0.75 but without exact likelihood ratios, we make an educated judgment.
