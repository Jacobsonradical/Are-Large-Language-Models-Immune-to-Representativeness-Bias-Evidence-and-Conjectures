{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is based on the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the probability of choosing a computer science professor at random \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \). Given Jason's interests and traits, which align more closely with those typically found in computer science, this straightforward Bayesian approach seems justified.
