{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the fact that Jasonâ€™s interests and characteristics suggest a stronger alignment with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Given that 75 out of the 100 professors are from computer science, the base rate probability is 0.75, which matches well with the description provided.
