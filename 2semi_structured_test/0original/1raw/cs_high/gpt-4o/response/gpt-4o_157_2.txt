Given the description provided for Jason and taking into account the details of the study with 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, one approach to estimate the probability is to consider both the base rates and the fit of the description.

1. **Base Rate Information:**
   - 75 out of the 100 professors are from computer science.
   - 25 out of the 100 professors are from the humanities.

2. **Description Fit:**
   - The description mentions interests such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely associated with computer science.

By using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor. We denote:

- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 0.75 (base rate of computer science professors)
- \( P(Hum) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 0.25 (base rate of humanities professors)
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (high, because he enjoys activities typical for computer science professors)
- \( P(D|Hum) \) = Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (low, because the activities are atypical for humanities professors)

Since we don't have exact probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) but can reasonably assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is much higher than \( P(D|Hum) \), we can simplify and assume \( P(D|CS) \approx 1 \) and \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.2 \).
