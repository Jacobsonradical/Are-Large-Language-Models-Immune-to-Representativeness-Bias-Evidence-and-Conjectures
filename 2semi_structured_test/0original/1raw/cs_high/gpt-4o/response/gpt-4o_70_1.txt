{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is derived from a Bayesian perspective, considering both the base rates of the two groups and the specific characteristics in Jason's description.

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study.
- Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical interests of a computer science professor, making it more likely that he is from that group.

Therefore, based on the given description and the base rates, the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
