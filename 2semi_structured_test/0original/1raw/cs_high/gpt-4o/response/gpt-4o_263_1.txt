To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we need to consider the base rates (or prior probabilities) and the likelihood of the description given those base rates.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Base Rates (Prior Probabilities)**:
   - \( P_{\text{CS}} \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P_{\text{H}} \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

   Given:
   - 75 computer science professors.
   - 25 humanities professors.

   Therefore:
   \[
   P_{\text{CS}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P_{\text{H}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): Probability of the description given the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \): Probability of the description given the professor is from the humanities.

   Jason's activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more aligned with the profile of a computer science professor. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that:

   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) > P(\text{Description} | \text{H})
   \]

   For simplicity, let's assume:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P
