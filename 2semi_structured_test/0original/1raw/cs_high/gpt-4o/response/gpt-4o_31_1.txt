{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the base rates provided in the problem: 75% of the professors (75 out of 100) are from computer science, and 25% (25 out of 100) are from the humanities. Jason's interests and personality traits align more closely with those expected of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), so the probability should weigh the base rate heavily. Hence, a reasonable estimate would be 0.75.
