To assess the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which involves combining prior probabilities with likelihoods.

First, we note the prior probabilities:
- Probability of a professor being from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of a professor being from humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description given the two categories. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits align more closely with a computer science background. Although we don't have precise likelihoods for these traits, we can reason that these interests are more likely in a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Thus, letâ€™s designate:
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) = h
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|Hum)\)) = l

Given the context and typical associations of the described activities, we can reasonably assume \(h > l\).

According to Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given the assumption that \(h\) is significantly greater than \(l\), the term \(P(D|
