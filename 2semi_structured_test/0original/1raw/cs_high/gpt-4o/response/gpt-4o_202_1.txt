To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. However, we can also use simple probability given the provided counts and common knowledge about typical preferences in different academic fields.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | Hum) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS | Desc) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Given:
- 75 professors are in computer science.
- 25 professors are in the humanities.

Therefore:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description aligns more closely with common characteristics of computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assume \( P(Desc | CS) \) is higher than \( P(Desc | Hum) \). 

If we make a rough estimate (as specifics about the exact likelihoods of descriptions were not provided), we can assume:
\[ P(Desc | CS) \approx 1 \]
\[ P(Desc | Hum) \approx 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc
