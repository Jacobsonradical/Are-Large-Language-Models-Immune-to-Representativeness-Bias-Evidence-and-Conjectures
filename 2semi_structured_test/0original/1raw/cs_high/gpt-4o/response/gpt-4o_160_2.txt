Given the details provided in the description, Bayesian reasoning can help us estimate the most likely probability.

The study sampled two groups of professors:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Let's consider the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor based on the description. The relevant factors are Jason’s interest and activities:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: more typical of computer science professors.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing: less typical of humanities professors, where these activities might be more common.

We start with the base rates:
- Probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given Jason’s description, we adjust these probabilities (posterior probabilities).

Given that these activities (coding and puzzles) fit more with the computer science profile, let's assume that a randomly chosen computer science professor is, by estimation, more likely to have these interests.

To solve this, we qualitatively assign higher weight to the factors mentioned to the likelihood of being a computer science professor:
- Let’s assume \( P(description | CS) = 0.9 \) (i.e., 90% of computer science professors fit this description).
- Let’s assume \( P(description | H) = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10% of humanities professors fit this description).

Now calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{
