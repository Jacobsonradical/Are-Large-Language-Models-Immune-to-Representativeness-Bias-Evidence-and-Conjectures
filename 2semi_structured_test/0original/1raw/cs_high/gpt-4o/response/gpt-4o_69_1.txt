Given the description, it seems to align more closely with characteristics and interests commonly associated with a computer science professor, particularly his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, we must also account for the base rates – the fact that 75% of the sample consists of computer science professors while 25% are from the humanities.

To quantify this, we can apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability:

P(CS | Description) = (P(Description | CS) * P(CS)) / P(Description)

Where:
- P(CS) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is 75/100 or 0.75.
- P(Description | CS) is the likelihood of the description given being a computer science professor.
- P(Description) is the overall probability of the description, which can be expanded into:
  P(Description) = P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) * P(Humanities)

Assuming the description is highly indicative of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor, we set P(Description | CS) as high (e.g., 0.9) and P(Description | Humanities) as low (e.g., 0.1). These are subjective estimations, reflecting how typical the description seems for each category.

Now, we can calculate:

P(CS | Description) ≈ (0.9 * 0.75) / (0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25)
               ≈ 0.675 / (0.675 + 0.025)
               ≈ 0.675 / 0.
