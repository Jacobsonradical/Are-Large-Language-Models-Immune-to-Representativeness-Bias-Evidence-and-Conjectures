{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a ratio of 3:1. Based on the description provided, Jason exhibits characteristics and hobbies typically associated with computer science (e.g., coding and solving mathematical puzzles). Taking into account both the base rate (3:1 ratio) and the alignment of his interests with computer science, the probability would be approximately 0.75, reflecting both the prior probability and the likelihood based on the given description.
