Given the information, our goal is to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. 

To solve this, we need to consider both the base rates of the two groups (computer science professors vs. humanities professors) and the likelihood of the provided description matching each group.

1. The base rates:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.

   Therefore, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is 75/100 = 0.75, and the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. The description:
   Jasonâ€™s interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing) are more stereotypically aligned with traits common among computer science professionals rather than humanities professionals.

To apply Bayes' theorem more formally but directly:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (assumed to be high based on the traits).
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior
