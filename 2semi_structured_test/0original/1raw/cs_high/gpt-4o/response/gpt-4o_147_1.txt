The problem at hand seems to fit the framework of Bayesian inference, where we need to determine the probability of a professor being in the computer science group given some attributes.

We are given:
- Total professors: 100
- Computer science professors: 75
- Humanities professors: 25
- The attributes of Jason

Using Bayesian reasoning:
- **Prior probability** (\(P(CS)\)) of someone being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The **Prior probability** (\(P(H)\)) of someone being a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we have to consider how likely someone with Jason's characteristics would be a computer science professor or a humanities professor, but for simplicity, letâ€™s consider the prior probabilities directly because the description strongly suggests characteristics more aligned with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities.

Given the strong alignment with typical attributes of computer science professors, we can reasonably assume a high likelihood (\(P(D|CS)\)) his description fits a computer science professor while likely lower for humanities (\(P(D|H)\)).

Given the strong alignment and considering all the information:

{"probability": "0.9"}
