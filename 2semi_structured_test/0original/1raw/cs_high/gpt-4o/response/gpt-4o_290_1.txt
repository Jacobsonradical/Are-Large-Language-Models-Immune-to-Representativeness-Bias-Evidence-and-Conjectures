{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description provided, Jason has several characteristics that align more closely with the field of computer science. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles are particularly indicative of a computer science professor. While the humanities can also involve creative problem-solving, the specific activities mentioned (coding and mathematical puzzles) are more directly aligned with computer science. Additionally, given the sample size of 75 computer science professors compared to only 25 humanities professors, there is a higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample which further supports the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Thus, a probability of 0.75 reflects this combined reasoning.
