{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving us a prior probability of 0.75 (75 out of 100) that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more aligned with traits typical of someone in computer science, it reinforces the initial prior probability, making 0.75 a reasonable estimate.
