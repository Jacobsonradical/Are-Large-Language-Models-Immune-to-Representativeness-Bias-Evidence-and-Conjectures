Based on the description provided, several aspects suggest that Jason is likely one of the computer science professors: he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, both of which are commonly associated with computer science. While the description also mentions Jason being highly creative, his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing further tilts the probability towards computer science rather than humanities, where such activities might be more prevalent.

Given this context and the fact that there are more computer science professors (75) than humanities professors (25) in the sample, the base rate also influences the likelihood in favor of Jason being a computer science professor.

Using Bayes' theorem informally and factoring the base rates along with the described interests, we can derive a higher chance for Jason being a computer science professor.

The probability can be estimated as follows:
{"probability": "0.9"}
