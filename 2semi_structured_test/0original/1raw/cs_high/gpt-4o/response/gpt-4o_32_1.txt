{"probability": "0.75"}

Based on the description provided, traits like coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly correlated with the field of computer science. Although these traits could potentially be found in humanities professors, they are more typical and relevant to computer science professors. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, and considering the given traits, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability to Jason being a computer science professor. Thus, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems appropriate.
