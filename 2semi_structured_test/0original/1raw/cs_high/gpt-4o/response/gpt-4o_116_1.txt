To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the total number of professors and the base rates**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.

2. **Calculate the prior probability of being a computer science professor**:
   \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Calculate the prior probability of being a humanities professor**:
   \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

4. **Consider the likelihoods based on Jason's description**:
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more common traits of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

5. **Estimate the likelihood of the description given the field**:
   - \( P(description | CS) \) is likely very high given Jason's interests align more with typical computer science activities.
   - \( P(description | H) \) is likely very low given the same reasons.

For simplicity, let's denote:
- \( P(description | CS) = x \) (where \( x \) is a high number)
- \( P(description | H) = y \) (where \( y \) is a low number, and \( y < x \))

The exact values of \( x \) and \( y \) are not provided, but we can assume \( x >> y \). 

6. **Apply Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS
