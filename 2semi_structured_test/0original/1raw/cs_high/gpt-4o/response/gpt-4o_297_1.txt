{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: The base rate for the computer science professors in the sample is 75 out of 100, or 0.75. The description of Jason aligns more closely with common traits and interests associated with computer science professors, which further suggests he is likely one of the computer science professors. Therefore, accounting for both the base rate and the given description, the probability is 0.75.
