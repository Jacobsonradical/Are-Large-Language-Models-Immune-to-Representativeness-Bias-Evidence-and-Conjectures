Given the details of the description and the base rates provided (75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors), we can approach this problem using Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Here's how we can apply Bayes' theorem in this context:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
    \[
    P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]

2. **Complement Probability (P(H))**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
    \[
    P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

3. **Likelihood (P(Description | CS))**: The probability of the description given the professor is a computer science professor. Given the description mentions coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with the characteristics of a computer science professor, we could reasonably assign a high likelihood to this (letâ€™s assume a relatively high value like 0.9, though this could vary based on actual data).

4. **Likelihood (P(Description | H))**: The probability of the description given the professor is a humanities professor. Since the description includes activities and traits not typically associated with humanities professors, we would assign a much lower likelihood to this (e.g., 0.1).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description}})
\]

Where:
