To address this question effectively, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's set up the prior probabilities based on the sample:

- The probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability \( P(A^C) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \), which are the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. Based on the given description and typical traits of professors in each field, let's make educated guesses:
- \( P(B|A) \): The description fits a computer science professor well due to interests in coding and mathematical puzzles. Let's assume an approximate probability of 0.8.
- \( P(B|A^C) \): The description fits a humanities professor less well as they might
