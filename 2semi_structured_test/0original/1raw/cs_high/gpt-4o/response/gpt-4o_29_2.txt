{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning behind this probability:

1. **Base Rates**: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. This gives a prior probability of being a computer science professor as 75/100 = 0.75, and a humanities professor as 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Description Match**: The description of Jason aligns more closely with typical characteristics often associated with computer science professors, such as enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing.

3. **No Contradictory Evidence**: There is nothing in the description that strongly contradicts the possibility of Jason being a computer science professor.

Considering the base rate and the description match, it is reasonable to estimate the probability at 0.75.
