{"probability": "0.75"}

This answer is based on the base rate of professors in each group. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 0.75 (75 out of 100). Given the description provided, which aligns more with typical interests and traits of computer science professors, it seems reasonable to maintain this prior probability.
