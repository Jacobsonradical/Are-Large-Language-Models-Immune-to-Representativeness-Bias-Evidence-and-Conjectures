Given the description of Jason and the context provided, we can use Bayes’ theorem to infer the probability that he is a computer science professor. Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( H \) as the event Jason is a humanities professor,
- \( D \) as the detailed description of Jason’s personality traits and interests.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we assume the probability of selecting a computer science professor is higher because they make up a larger portion of the sample:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description seems more in line with interests typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles), we estimate:
\[ P(D|C) > P(D|H) \]

Let's make an educated guess for simplicity, assuming \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

Now we calculate \( P(D) \), using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \
