To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This will help us combine the base rates (the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors) with the likelihood of Jason's description given that he's in either group.

First, let's note the base rates:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities.

This gives us:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we consider how Jason's description fits with typical stereotypes of computer science and humanities professors. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align more closely with characteristics stereotypically associated with computer science professors. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more relevant for humanities professors.

Let's denote:
- P(Description | CS) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(Description | Hum) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the strong match to characteristics of computer science professors, we can reasonably assume:
- P(Description | CS) is high, say approximately 0.9.
- P(Description | Hum) is low, say approximately 0.1.

Bayes' theorem calculates the posterior probability P(CS | Description) as follows:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]
