{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: The description of Jason aligns more closely with the common traits often found in computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities professors. Given that there are three times as many computer science professors (75) as humanities professors (25) in the sample, it makes it even more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Specifically, the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors is 75/100. Based on this and the alignment of his interests and traits with the field of computer science, I estimate the probability to be 0.75.
