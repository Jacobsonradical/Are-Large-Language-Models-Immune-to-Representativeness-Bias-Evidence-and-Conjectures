To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which involves prior probabilities and likelihoods.

1. **Prior Information:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors (Cs) and 25 humanities professors (Hs).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(C)\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need the likelihoods of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|C)\)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)).
   - Jason's interests and traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing strongly suggest he aligns more with computer science.

For simplification, let's assume the following:
- The probability of such a description accurately fitting a computer science professor is relatively high (e.g., \(P(D|C) = 0.9\)).
- The probability of such a description fitting a humanities professor is relatively low (e.g., \(P(D|H) = 0.1\)).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \times P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \times P
