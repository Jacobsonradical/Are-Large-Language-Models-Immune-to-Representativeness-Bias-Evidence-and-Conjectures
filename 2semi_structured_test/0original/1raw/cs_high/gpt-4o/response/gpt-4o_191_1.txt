To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The problem provides us with a description of Jason, from which we might infer whether he is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on their personality traits and interests.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

From the setup:
- We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \), of Jason being a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more associated with humanities.

Assuming Jason's interests significantly align with those of typical computer science professors, we'll estimate \( P(B|A) \) to be higher for computer science professors. Given that we don't have exact data, let's make a reasonable assumption
