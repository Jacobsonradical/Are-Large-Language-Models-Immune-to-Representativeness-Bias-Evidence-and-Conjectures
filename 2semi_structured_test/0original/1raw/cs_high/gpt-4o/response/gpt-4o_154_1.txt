{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the base rate of the two groups in the study. Since 75% of the professors in the sample are from computer science (75 out of 100), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75. The description provided aligns more closely with the typical interests and skills associated with computer science, which further supports maintaining this base rate probability.
