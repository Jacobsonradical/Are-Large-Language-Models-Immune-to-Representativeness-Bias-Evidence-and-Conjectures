{"probability": "0.75"}

To reach this probability, I used the base rates of the two groups and evaluated the description's alignment with common traits in each field. Here's the reasoning:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The probability that a randomly chosen description belongs to a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The personality description of Jason (likes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not into drawing or writing) strongly aligns with traits often associated with computer science rather than the humanities.

Given the combination of the base rate and the specific details, it's reasonable to assess a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
