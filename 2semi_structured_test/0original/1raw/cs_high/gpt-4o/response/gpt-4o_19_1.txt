Let's break, down the information PIECSedly before providing a probability. 

We have:
- 100 professors in total (75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities).
- Description of Jason suggests attributes like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which may be more common among computer science professors given the technical nature of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
- Jason also prefers not to engage in activities like drawing or writing, which might lean more towards humanities professors.

Based on this analysis, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We start with the prior probability, the base rate:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75.
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we use the likelihood of Jason's profile given the discipline. While specific detailed data aren't provided, let’s assume that the interests described (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.) are significantly more likely among computer science professors. For simplicity, let's estimate:
- P(Jason’s Profile | CS) = 0.9 (since his interests align strongly with computer science).
- P(Jason’s Profile | Hum) = 0.1 (since his interests don't align as well with humanities).

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason’s Profile) = \frac{P(Jason’s Profile | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P
