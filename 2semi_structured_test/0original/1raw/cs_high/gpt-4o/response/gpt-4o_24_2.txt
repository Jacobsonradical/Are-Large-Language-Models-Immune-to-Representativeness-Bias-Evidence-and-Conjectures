Given that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate for Jason being a computer science professor is 75 out of 100.

Taking into account the description provided:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common interests among computer science academics.
- He is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which aligns more with a typical computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

Considering both the base rates and the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be quite high. Hence, I'll estimate the probability accordingly.

{"probability": "0.9"}
