{"probability": "0.75"}

Jason's interests and personality traits such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing align more closely with typical stereotypes of computer science professors compared to humanities professors. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, a straightforward interpretation would be to weigh the likelihood based on these proportions, adjusted slightly for the interest alignment which predominantly aligns with computer science traits. Thus, approximately 75% likelihood is a reasonable estimate.
