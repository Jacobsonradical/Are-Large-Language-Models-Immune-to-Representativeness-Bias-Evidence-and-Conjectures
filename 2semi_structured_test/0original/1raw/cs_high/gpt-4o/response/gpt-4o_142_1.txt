Given the information provided, we can employ Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Base Rates**: Initially, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(HS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods**: We need to assess how likely this description is for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, indicators that lean more towards a computer science professor. He is also highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be less indicative of a humanities professor.

   Let's denote the description of Jason as \(D\). We need to estimate:
   - \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|HS) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

   Given the clear alignment of Jason's interests and traits with those typical of computer science professionals, we can reasonably assume that:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|HS) \).

   For illustration, let's assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
   - \( P(D|HS) = 0.1 \)

3. **Bayesian Update**: We can then use Bayes' theorem to update our probabilities:
