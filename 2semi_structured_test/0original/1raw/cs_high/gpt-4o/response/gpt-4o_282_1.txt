Based on the given description, the traits and hobbies of Jason (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) strongly point toward a profile that is more stereotypically associated with computer science professors. However, it is also important to account for the distribution of the sample: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be outlined as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100}\).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of someone having the description Jason has.

\( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description aligns more with typical activities of a computer science professor, we can assume a high probability for \( P(B|A) \). Let's assume it's around 0.9. For humanities professors, the probability \( P(B| \neg A) \), or the likelihood of a humanities professor fitting Jason's description, might be lower. Let's estimate it around 0.1 due to the less frequent correlation with the given traits.

So,

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B| \neg A) \
