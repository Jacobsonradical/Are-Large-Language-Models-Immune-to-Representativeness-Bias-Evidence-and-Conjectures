{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on a consideration of Jason's interests and traits. Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with the field of computer science, it is more likely that he is one of the computer science professors. To be more quantitative, we use Bayesian reasoning. Initially, before hearing Jason's description, the probability of him being a computer science professor is 75/100, or 0.75, since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total. Given his interests and traits, this probability increases as these traits are more indicative of a computer science professor.
