Given the description of Jason's interests and traits, including his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it aligns more consistently with the typical profile of a computer science professor. The sample size also suggests that computer science professors outnumber humanities professors by a ratio of 3 to 1. Balancing the traits and the sample distribution, we can derive a probability:

1. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science \( P(\text{CS}) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).
2. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).

Given Jason's profile, his likelihood of being a computer science professor is higher. We update our belief based on the given descriptive traits:

Hence, the probability \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's description}) \approx 0.9 \):

{"probability": "0.9"}
