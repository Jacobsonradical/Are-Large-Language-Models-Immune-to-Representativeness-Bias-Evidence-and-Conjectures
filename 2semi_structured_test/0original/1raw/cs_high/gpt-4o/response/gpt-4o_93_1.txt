Given Jason's interests and personality traits, it seems more likely that he might be one of the computer science professors. However, to determine the probability properly, we must take into account the proportion of computer science professors versus humanities professors in the study and any relevant details in the description.

In this study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The prior probabilities of randomly selecting a professor from either group are:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor (PC(CompSci)): 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor (PC(Humanities)): 25/100 = 0.25

Given Jason's description, we need to infer which group he is more likely to belong to based on the provided traits and interests. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more closely associated with computer science rather than the humanities. Although interest in jogging is neutral, the lack of interest in drawing or writing leans slightly away from the humanities.

Assuming the provided traits are strongly indicative of the computer science group:

- High likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor (Likelihood(CompSci)): high
- Low likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor (Likelihood(Humanities)): low

Using Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probabilities based on Jason's description, we will generally judge the posterior probabilities as:

Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
P(CompSci | Jason) â‰ˆ (Prior(CompSci) * Likelihood(Jason | CompSci)) / (Prior(CompSci) * Likelihood(Jason | CompSci) + Prior(Humanities) * Likelihood(Jason | Humanities))
