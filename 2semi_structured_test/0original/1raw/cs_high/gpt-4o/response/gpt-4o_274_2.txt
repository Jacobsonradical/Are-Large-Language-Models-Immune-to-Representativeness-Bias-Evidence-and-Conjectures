{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
Given the description, Jason's interests and characteristics align more closely with those typically found in a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. The initial breakdown of the sample is 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, a 3:1 ratio. The description fits more naturally within the realm of computer science, thus increasing the probability that Jason is one of the 75 computer science professors. The updated probability is 0.75.
