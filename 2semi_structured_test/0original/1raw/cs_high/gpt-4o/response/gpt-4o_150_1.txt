{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation:
Given that there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate for being a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75. The description provided for Jason aligns more closely with stereotypical traits and interests often associated with computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities professors. Therefore, based on both the base rate and the relevant description, the estimated probability is 0.75.
