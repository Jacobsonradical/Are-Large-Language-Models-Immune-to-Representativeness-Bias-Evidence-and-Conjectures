Given the description of Jason and the information from the study, it is important to consider both the base rates (proportion of professors in each group) and the description provided. 

Here are the relevant base rates:
- 75% (75 out of 100) of the professors are in computer science.
- 25% (25 out of 100) of the professors are in the humanities.

Jason's description aligns significantly more with characteristics typically associated with computer science (interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than with the humanities. Therefore, we should weigh the base rate heavily but also consider the fit of the description.

Combining the base rate and the description fit:
- Base rate for computer science: 0.75
- High likelihood based on the description fit.

A reasonable estimate will be higher than the base rate, reflecting the stronger alignment with computer science characteristics in the provided description.

Therefore, the probability can be estimated as follows:

{"probability": "0.9"}
