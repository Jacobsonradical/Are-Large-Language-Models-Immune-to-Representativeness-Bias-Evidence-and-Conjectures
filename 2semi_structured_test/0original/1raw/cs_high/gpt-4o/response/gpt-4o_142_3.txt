To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors from the given sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem in a simplified way. The key is to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of Jason's profile fitting either group.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Total computer science professors (CS): 75
   - Total humanities professors (H): 25
   - Probability Jason is a CS professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability Jason is a H professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood Based on Description**:
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities typically associated more strongly with computer science professionals than with humanities professionals.
   - Jason also does not enjoy drawing or writing, which contrasts with typical activities in the humanities.

Given Jason's hobbies and interests align more closely with the common activities of a computer science professor, the likelihood (considering the description) that Jason is a CS professor is significantly higher.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \)
