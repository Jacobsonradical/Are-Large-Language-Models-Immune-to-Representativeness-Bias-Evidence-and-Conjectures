Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, I will follow the Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability.

Firstly, we have prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- Probability Jason is from Computer Science (P(CS)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability Jason is from Humanities (P(H)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, based on the description, we evaluate the likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Considering that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and not drawing or writing, these interests and characteristics are much more aligned with typical computer science professors than humanities professors.

While exact likelihood ratios are not provided, the strong alignment of Jason's traits with typical activities and interests of computer science professors suggests that the likelihood ratio significantly favors the computer science category. Given this strong alignment, we will assume that the specificity of the description sharply increases our confidence in Jason being from the computer science group.

Using this qualitative assessment (in the absence of precise likelihood ratios), it is reasonable to significantly adjust our prior probability upwards. 

So, we might estimate this posterior probability as very high, possibly at least 0.95 based on psychological profiling consistency.

Therefore:
{"probability": "0.95"}
