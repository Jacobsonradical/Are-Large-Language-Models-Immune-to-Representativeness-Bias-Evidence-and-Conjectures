Given the description, we can utilize Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. We need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) for each group and update them with the likelihood given the additional information (Jason's description).

- Base rate for a professor being in computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Base rate for a professor being in humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, given stereotypes and typical interests.

For simplicity, we will assume the description fits very well with a computer science professor (likelihood close to 1) and less well with a humanities professor (likelihood close to 0).

Letâ€™s use these likelihoods to update our probabilities:

- Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(Description|CS) \)): High, let's assume 0.9
- Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(Description|Hum) \)): Low, let's assume 0.1

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \
