To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Given the description of Jason's interests and traits, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, we also need to consider the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

First, let's establish the probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability (P(H)) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, considering the given description of Jason, it's important to note that the traits and interests mentioned align more closely with typical characteristics of a computer science professor: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being conservative and careful. This increases the likelihood that Jason belongs to this group.

We don't have exact data on the likelihood (P(description | CS)) of a computer science professor having these traits versus a humanities professor (P(description | H)). However, qualitatively, we can assume that the traits are more common among computer science professors.

For simplicity, let's assume that:
- The probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor (P(description | CS)) = 0.9.
- The probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor (P(description | H)) = 0.1.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cd
