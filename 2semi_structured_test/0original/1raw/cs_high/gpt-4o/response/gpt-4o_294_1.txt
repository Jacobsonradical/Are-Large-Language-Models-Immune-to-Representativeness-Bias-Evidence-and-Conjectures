Given the description and the base rates provided in the study, we need to assess the probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. 

To start, let's look at the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The proportion of humanities professors in the sample is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Jason's description includes traits that seem more aligned with typical computer science interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities interests. To determine the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We are looking for \(P(C \mid D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is 0.75.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is 0.25.
- \(P(D \mid C)\) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D \mid H)\) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the normalizing constant,
