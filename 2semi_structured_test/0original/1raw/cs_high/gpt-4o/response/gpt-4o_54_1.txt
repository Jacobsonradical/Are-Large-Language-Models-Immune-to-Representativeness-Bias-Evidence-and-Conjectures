To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's consider the base rates and the description provided:

1. **Base Rates**: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. So the prior probability \(P(CS)\) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
and the prior probability \(P(H)\) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Description Fit**: The description of Jason fits more closely with typical traits associated with computer science professors - interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, and a lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with humanities professors.

Given this fit, it is reasonable to assume Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. Because the description strongly suggests traits typical of someone in computer science, it would bias our posterior probability further in favor of computer science.

Using Bayes' theorem to formalize our intuition:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming description \(D\) is more likely for computer science professors, we approximate \(P(D|CS)\) higher than \(P(D|H)\). For simplicity, let's make a rough adjustment (you would need detailed statistics for precise calculation).

If we estimate \(P(D|CS)\) (probability of the description given a CS professor) to be very high, say 0.9, and \(P(D|
