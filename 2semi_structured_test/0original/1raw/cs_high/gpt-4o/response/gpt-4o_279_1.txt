Given the information provided, we need to assess the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's consider the base rates: there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the probability of picking a computer science professor at random \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and a humanities professor \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Then, we analyze Jason's description. His interests and traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging align more closely with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. While these traits are not definitive or exclusive to computer science, given the context of the study, they do increase the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

To formalize this probabilistic reasoning, we can apply Bayes' theorem, though for simplicity, we can reason qualitatively that the description more strongly suggests Jason is a computer science professor.

Thus, considering both the base rates and the relevant interests and traits, we can reasonably increase the prior probability.

{"probability": "0.9"}
