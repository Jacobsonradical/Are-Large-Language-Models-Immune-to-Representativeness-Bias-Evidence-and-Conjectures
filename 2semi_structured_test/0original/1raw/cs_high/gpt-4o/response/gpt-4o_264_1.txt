Based on the description provided, there appear to be indicators that suggest Jason might be a computer science professor, such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. 

To determine the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a simplified approach:

Given:
- Total professors: 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- The prior probabilities are 75/100 for a computer science professor and 25/100 for a humanities professor.

Jason's traits and hobbies seem more aligned with those typical of a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding (strong indicator)
- Enjoys solving mathematical puzzles (another indicator)
- Does not enjoy writing (less typical for humanities)

Let’s use these considerations for our Bayesian update:
- Standard assumption would be that such a profile fits more naturally into computer science than humanities, increasing our confidence in Jason being a computer science professor.

Based on these qualitative evaluations, let’s assign a higher likelihood to Jason being in computer science, although exact numerical updating isn't detailed here, an educated guess within a reasonable range would deliver a more weighted probability towards computer science:

{"probability": "0.9"}
