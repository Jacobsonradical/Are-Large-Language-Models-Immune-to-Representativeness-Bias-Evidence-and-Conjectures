{"probability": "0.75"}

I arrived at this estimate because Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more closely aligned with common pursuits in the field of computer science rather than the humanities. Additionally, his lack of enjoyment in drawing and writing, activities often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he belongs to the computer science group. While the base rates (75% computer science, 25% humanities) are also in favor of Jason being a computer science professor, the details of his profile reinforce this conclusion.
