To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability based on new evidence.

First, let's establish some initial values:
- Total number of professors: 100 (75 in computer science + 25 in humanities)
- Prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely it is that a professor with Jason's description would belong to each group. The description of Jason includes attributes that seem more aligned with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Let's assume:
- Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \) that Jason's description applies to a computer science professor is high, say 0.9.
- Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \) that Jason's description applies to a humanities professor is lower, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) = \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \times P(H) \), we have:

\[ P(\text
