To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

We also need to estimate the likelihood that Jason's description matches the traits expected of a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these traits are more aligned with computer science than humanities. Let's assume:
- The probability of such traits given a computer science professor (P(Traits | CS)) is quite high, say 0.9.
- The probability of such traits given a humanities professor (P(Traits | Humanities)) is quite low, say 0.1.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Traits) = \frac{P(Traits | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Traits)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(Traits) \):

\[ P(Traits) = P(Traits | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Traits | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(Traits) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Traits) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(Traits) = 0.7 \]

Next, we plug this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Traits) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS
