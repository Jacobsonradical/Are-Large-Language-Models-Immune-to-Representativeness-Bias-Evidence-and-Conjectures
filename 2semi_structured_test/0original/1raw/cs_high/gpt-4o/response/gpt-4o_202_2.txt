Given the description of Jason, several aspects point towards him likely being a computer science professor:

1. **Enjoyment of coding**: Coding is a fundamental activity associated with computer science.
2. **Solving mathematical puzzles**: This aligns more closely with the skills and interests typically found in computer science than in the humanities.
3. **Lack of interest in drawing or writing**: These activities are more commonly associated with the humanities.

However, we also need to consider the base rates – there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Let's use this information to help calculate the probability.

1. **Base rate probability (prior probability)**:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood given the description**: Considering that Jason's interests (coding, mathematical puzzles) are heavily indicative of computer science, we might say that the probability of such a description given he is a CS professor is quite high, let’s denote it \( P(D|CS) \), and similarly, the probability of such a description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \), is quite low.

   - Let us make an educated guess that \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) to illustrate since such precise probabilities would typically come from specific data or domain expertise.

3. **Posterior probability**: We use Bayes' Theorem to combine all this information
