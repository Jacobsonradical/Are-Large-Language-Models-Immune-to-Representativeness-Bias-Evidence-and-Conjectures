To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors from the given description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to compute the posterior probability based on prior probabilities and the likelihood of observed data.

First, let's define our events:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- The description provided matches Jason's characteristics.

Bayes' Theorem equation is:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{ P(D|C) \cdot P(C) }{ P(D) } \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of observing Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing Jason's description.

Given data:
- 75 computer science professors.
- 25 humanities professors.

So, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the description is more likely to be that of a computer science professor given Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Letâ€™s assume the likelihood ratios:
- \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high, say 0.9 (since the description strongly matches typical computer science traits).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low
