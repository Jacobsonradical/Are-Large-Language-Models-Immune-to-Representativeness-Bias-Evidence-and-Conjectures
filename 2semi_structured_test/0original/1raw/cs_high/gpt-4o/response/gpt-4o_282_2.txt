{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: 

We have a total of 100 professors, with 75 being from computer science and 25 from the humanities. The base rate probability (prior) of selecting a computer science professor is 75/100 or 0.75.

Based on the description of Jason, his interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing) align more closely with what one might expect from a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. These specific indicators further suggest a higher likelihood that Jason is from the computer science group. 

Thus, the description increases our inclination to lean toward the base rate probability, and without any additional bias-altering factors, it seems reasonable to stick with the prior probability of 0.75.
