{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is influenced by prior probabilities, also known as base rates, and the description provided. Given that 75 out of the 100 professors come from computer science, the base rate for a randomly selected professor being from computer science is 0.75. Considering the description aligns more closely with typical traits and interests associated with computer science professors rather than those in the humanities, this further supports the base rate, maintaining the probability at 0.75.
