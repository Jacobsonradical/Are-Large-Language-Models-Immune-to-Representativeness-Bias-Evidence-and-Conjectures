{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason, his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Additionally, the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample is 75:25. This suggests a higher base rate for Jason being a computer science professor. Combining both the base rate and the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is reasonably high. Therefore, estimating a probability of 0.75 is justified.
