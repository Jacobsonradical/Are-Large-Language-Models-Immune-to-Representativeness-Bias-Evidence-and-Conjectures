{"probability": "0.75"}

This estimate is based on the fact that Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more strongly associated with computer science professors. Given the sample sizes, we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability of picking a computer science professor is 0.75 (75 out of 100). Jason's description fits more closely with the profile of a computer science professor, reinforcing this initial probability.
