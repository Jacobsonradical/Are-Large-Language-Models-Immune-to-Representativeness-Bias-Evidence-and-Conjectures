Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's break down the information:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
2. We're given Jason's description, which includes several characteristics that might tilt the probability towards one field over the other:
   - Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (activities that are more closely related to computer science).
   - Creative, but doesn't enjoy drawing or writing (aspects that might be less associated with humanities).

To estimate the probability:

- Probability (P) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Probability (P) that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given Jason's characteristics, let's denote these as evidence \( E \). We need to compare \( P(CS \mid E) \) and \( P(H \mid E) \).

Since Jason's activities and interests align more with typical characteristics of computer science professors, we can assume that the likelihood \( P(E \mid CS) \) is substantially higher than \( P(E \mid H) \).

To simplify the calculation without precise numerical values for \( P(E \mid CS) \) and \( P(E \mid H) \), we can approximate that the description significantly favors computer science:

Thus:
\[ P(CS \mid E) \approx \frac{P(E \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
