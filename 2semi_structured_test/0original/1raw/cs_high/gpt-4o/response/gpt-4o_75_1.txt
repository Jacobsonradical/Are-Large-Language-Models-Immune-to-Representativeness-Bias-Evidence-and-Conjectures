Given the description of Jason and the aim of the study, we need to figure out the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors.

First, let's consider the base rates: there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, resulting in a total of 100 professors.

Given this base rate, the probability of randomly picking a computer science professor is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

The specific traits of Jason (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creativity without an affinity for drawing or writing) are more aligned with typical traits associated with computer science than humanities. 

Considering the alignment of Jason's interests with computer science and the higher base rate of computer science professors in the sample, we can reasonably estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Based on this alignment and the prior probability, the probability can be expressed as:
\[ \text{{probability}} = \frac{{0.75 \times \text{{relative alignment of traits with computer science}}}}{1} \]

While it requires subjective judgment to account for the matching of traits, we will integrate both the base rate and the trait alignment to balance the estimate.

Thus, integrating both the examination of traits and proportions, we arrive at an answer:

{"probability": "0.85"}
