Given the description of Jason and the context provided, applying some basic probabilistic reasoning can help in determining the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. We can utilize Bayes' theorem to assist in solving this problem. Here is one way to approach this problem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood based on Jason's description:**
   - Given the traits and interests described for Jason — coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and a disinterest in drawing or writing — it's more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote the description of Jason as \( D \).

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where,
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

   Ignoring the exact value calculation for simplicity and focusing on relative reasoning:
   - It’s reasonable to assume \( P(D|CS) \) is quite high
