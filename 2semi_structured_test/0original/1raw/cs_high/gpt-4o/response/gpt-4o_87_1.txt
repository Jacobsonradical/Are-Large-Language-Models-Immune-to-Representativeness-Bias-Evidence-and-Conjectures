To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Event that Jason matches the description provided.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches the description.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability that a humanities professor matches the description.

The description suggests interests and traits that are more stereotypically aligned with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Assuming a higher likelihood for computer science:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \] (high probability)
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \]
