{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is calculated by considering that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Given Jason's interests and traits, it is more likely that he is a computer science professor, but there is still a possibility he could be in the humanities, hence the probability is weighted accordingly.
