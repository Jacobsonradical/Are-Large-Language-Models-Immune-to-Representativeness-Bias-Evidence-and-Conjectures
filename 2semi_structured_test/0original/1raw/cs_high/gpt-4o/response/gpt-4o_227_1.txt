Given the description of Jason, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that he is a computer science professor.

First, let's consider the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- So, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we look at the description of Jason and how likely such a description would match a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason’s characteristics include enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These traits strongly suggest a background more aligned with computer science than humanities.

Given the nature of the description, it seems highly probable (but not 100% certain) that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. For the sake of estimation, let’s assume:
- The probability of this description given Jason is a computer science professor, P(description | CS), is very high. Let’s assume it is 0.95.
- The probability of this description given Jason is a humanities professor, P(description | Humanities), is very low. Let’s assume it is 0.05.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

where,

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description} | Humanities) \times
