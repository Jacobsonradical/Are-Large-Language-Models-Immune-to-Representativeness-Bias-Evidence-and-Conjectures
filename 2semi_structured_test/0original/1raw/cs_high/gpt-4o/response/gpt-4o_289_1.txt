Based on the description of Jason's interests and traits (such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it seems more likely that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample. This population includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Let's apply Bayesian reasoning to this problem:

- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Given Jason's description, which heavily aligns with typical computer science interests (coding, mathematical puzzles), we can adjust our belief based on this evidence.

While this exact approach doesn't give a precise posterior probability without more detailed calculations, the description strongly suggests Jason is more likely from the computer science group than the humanities group. Therefore, we can reasonably estimate the probability as significantly above the prior of 0.75, but not quite certain, considering we might need more data for a precise posterior.

Given these considerations:

{"probability": "0.9"}
