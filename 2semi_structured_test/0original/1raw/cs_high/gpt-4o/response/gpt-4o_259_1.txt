To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given about Jason.

We want to calculate \( P(CS|D) \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we must consider how likely the description fits a professor in each field. Given the details of the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), these characteristics seem more common in computer science professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (very
