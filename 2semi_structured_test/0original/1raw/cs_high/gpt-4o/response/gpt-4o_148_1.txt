Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities more commonly associated with someone in the field of computer science rather than the humanities. This assumption aligns with known stereotypes and common interests of professionals in these fields.

However, let's also consider the base rates of the two groups in the study:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Given that Jason was randomly chosen from one of these two groups, here is a simple way to determine the probability:

1. **Base Probability**:
    - Prior probability of Jason being in computer science: 75/100 = 0.75
    - Prior probability of Jason being in the humanities: 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood based on the description** (qualitative):
    - The description fits more closely with a stereotypical computer science professor.

Combining the base rates with the fit of the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should be weighted heavily towards the higher base rate group (computer science professors) given the additional matching on interests.

Therefore, the probability:

{"probability": "0.9"}
