Given the information in the description and the base rates of the two groups (75 in computer science and 25 in humanities), we need to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem.

The prior probabilities (base rates) are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

We then evaluate the likelihood of Jason’s description being from each group. 

Jason’s hobbies and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, conservative, etc.) fit more closely with the stereotypes of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Although this evaluation is subjective, it's reasonable to assign higher likelihood to the description for a computer science professor.

Let's denote:
- P(Desc | CS): Likelihood of the description given Jason is a CS professor.
- P(Desc | Hum): Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

If we assume these likelihoods (based on stereotype matching):
- P(Desc | CS) = 0.9
- P(Desc | Hum) = 0.1

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(CS | Desc) = [P(Desc | CS) * P(CS)] / [P(Desc | CS) * P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) * P(Hum)]

Substituting the values:

P(CS | Desc) = [0.9 * 0.75
