Given the provided description of Jason, we need to estimate the likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor in the sample. Here’s how we can think through this problem:

1. **Base Rates**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the proportion of computer science professors in the sample is 75 out of 100, and the proportion of humanities professors is 25 out of 100.

2. **Personality and Interests**:
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities that are commonly associated with computer science.
   - These activities are less commonly associated with humanities professors.
   - Although Jason is also described as creative, which might be common in both fields, the lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing might align more with the typical profile of a computer scientist rather than a humanities professor.

We can apply Bayes’ theorem here qualitatively:
- **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**: The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is from computer science is 0.75 (75/100).
- **Likelihood**: The likelihood that a computer science professor matches Jason's description is higher than the likelihood that a humanities professor matches it, based on the interests of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Taking the base rates and the description into account, I would estimate a high probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Therefore, my estimated probability is:

{"probability": "0.9"}
