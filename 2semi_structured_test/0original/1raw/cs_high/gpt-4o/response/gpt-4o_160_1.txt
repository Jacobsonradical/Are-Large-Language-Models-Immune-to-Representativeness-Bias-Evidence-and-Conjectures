Given the description and the effort to include relevant data from the study, I'll apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

First, let's define:
- \(C\): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.

The key probabilities we need are:
- \(P(C) = 0.75\) (Since 75% of the sample are computer science professors).
- \(P(H) = 0.25\) (Since 25% of the sample are humanities professors).

We are looking for \(P(C | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C | D)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(D | C)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the normalizing constant, which can be expanded to:
  \[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate those probabilities:
- \(P(D | C)\): Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\): Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor
