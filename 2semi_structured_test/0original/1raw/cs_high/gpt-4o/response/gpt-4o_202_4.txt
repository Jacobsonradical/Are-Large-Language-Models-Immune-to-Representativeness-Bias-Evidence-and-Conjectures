Given the information: 

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the base rates \(\frac{3}{4}\) for computer science and \(\frac{1}{4}\) for humanities.
- Jason enjoys activities more closely associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than the humanities.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability that Jason is from the computer science group.

Combining both the base rate and the match between Jason's interests and personality traits typical of a computer science professor, we might estimate a probability close to the base rate, but slightly adjusted upwards because of the specific details given.

Hereâ€™s a reasonable estimate:

{"probability": "0.85"}
