{"probability": "0.75"}

Given that Jason's interests align more closely with activities typically associated with computer science—such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles—it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of him being one of the computer science professors. Considering there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate is 3:1 in favor of computer science professors.
