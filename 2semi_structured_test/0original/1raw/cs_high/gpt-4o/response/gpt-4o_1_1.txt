Given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

First, let's establish the prior probability:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\) for any given professor being from computer science is \(75/100 = 0.75\).
- Similarly, the prior probability \(P(\text{Humanities})\) for being from humanities is \(25/100 = 0.25\).

Next, we analyze the description of Jason to establish how likely it is that someone with these traits comes from computer science or humanities. Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles heavily suggests a computer science background, while his lack of interest in drawing or writing leans away from the humanities.

Thus, we qualitatively assess:
- \(P(D|CS)\), the likelihood of the description if Jason is from computer science, is high (let's assume it is 0.9 for the sake of this estimation).
- \(P(D|Humanities)\), the likelihood of the description if Jason is from the humanities, is low (we estimate it around 0.1).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D)
