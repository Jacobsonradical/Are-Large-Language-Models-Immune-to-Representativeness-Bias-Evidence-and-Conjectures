Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, it is necessary to consider not only the content of the description but also the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample.

The total number of professors in the sample is 100, with 75 being from computer science and 25 from the humanities. Thus, the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor is 75/100 (0.75), and the prior probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor is 25/100 (0.25).

The description of Jason includes several aspects that align more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor: he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.

Considering both the prior probabilities and the specific characteristics described, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is high. Thus, the probability might be estimated as follows:

{"probability": "0.95"}
