Based on the description provided, Jason has several characteristics that might lean more towards a computer science professor. Specifically, his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles align closely with typical interests in the field of computer science.

Given the sample sizes, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. From a simple prior probability standpoint (without considering the description), the probability that someone chosen at random is a computer science professor is 75/(75+25) = 0.75 or 75%.

Jason's interests and personality traits further support the likelihood of him being a computer science professor. 

Therefore, considering both the prior probability and the additional description, it's reasonable to increase the initial probability.
