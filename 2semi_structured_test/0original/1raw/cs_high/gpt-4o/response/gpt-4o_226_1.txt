Given the description of Jason and the information about the professors, we can use Bayesian inference to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Humanities) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description | Humanities) \) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Description) \) as the overall probability of the description.

The prior probabilities are based on the sample proportions:
- Out of 100 professors, 75 are from computer science.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description seems to fit a computer science professor more closely due to the interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, compared to humanities professors who are generally expected to have interests like drawing or writing. Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is much higher than \( P(Description | Humanities) \).

Without specific numerical values but based on reasonable assumptions and the Bayes' theorem, which states \( P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \), we can qualitatively infer that:

- Since the description aligns more with a typical computer science professor, e.g., enjoying coding
