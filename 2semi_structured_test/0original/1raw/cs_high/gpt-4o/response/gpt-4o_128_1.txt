Given the description of Jason, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

The first step is to establish the prior probabilities. The sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

- Probability (P) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \):
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \) based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor.
- Therefore, \( P(D | CS) \) should be high, while \( P(D | Hum) \) should be lower.

Let's assume:
- Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \):
\[ P(D | CS) = 0.9 \]

- Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(D | Hum) \):
\[ P(D | Hum) = 0.1 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the values
