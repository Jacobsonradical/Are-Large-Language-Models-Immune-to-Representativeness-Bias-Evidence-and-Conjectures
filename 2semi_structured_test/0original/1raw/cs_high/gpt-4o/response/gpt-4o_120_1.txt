{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning behind this probability:

1. **Prior Probabilities**: In the study, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. So, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood Based on Description**:
    - Jason's interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more aligned with common traits of computer science professors.
    - His lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing could be less common for humanities professors.
  
3. **Bayesian Reasoning**:
    - Given the description, it seems more probable that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor.
  
Thus, considering the prior probability and the likelihood of his description fitting the profile of a computer science professor, a probability of 0.75 is a reasonable estimation.
