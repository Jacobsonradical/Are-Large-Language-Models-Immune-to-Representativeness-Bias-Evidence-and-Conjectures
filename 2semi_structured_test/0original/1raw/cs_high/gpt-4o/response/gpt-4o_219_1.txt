{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: The description of Jason aligns very well with attributes often associated with computer science professors, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, whereas there is less alignment with typical activities associated with humanities professors. Additionally, there are 75 computer science professors versus 25 humanities professors in the sample, further increasing the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Using Bayesian inference and considering the prior probability (75/100 for computer science and 25/100 for humanities), it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to Jason being a computer science professor.
