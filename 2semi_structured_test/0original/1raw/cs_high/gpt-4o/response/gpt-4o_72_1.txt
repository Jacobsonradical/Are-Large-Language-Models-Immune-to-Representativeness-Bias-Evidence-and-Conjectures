{"probability": "0.75"}

**Reasoning**: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Given Jasonâ€™s interests and personality traits, such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is more likely that he is one of the computer science professors. Using Bayesian inference, the initial probability (prior) of Jason being a computer science professor is 0.75 (since 75 out of 100 are in computer science). Considering the described traits that align more closely with a computer science background, the probability remains consistent at 0.75.
