{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason displays characteristics and interests (such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing) that are typically associated with computer science rather than humanities. Additionally, the sample size includes 75 computer science professors and only 25 humanities professors. This provides a prior probability of 0.75 (75%) that any randomly chosen professor from this group is a computer science professor.

Using both the prior probability and the characteristics described, it is reasonable to estimate that Jason has a higher likelihood of being in the computer science group.
