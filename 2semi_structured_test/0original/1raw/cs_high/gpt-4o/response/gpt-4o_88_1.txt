{"probability": "0.75"}

This is based on the observation that Jason's interests and traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, align more closely with typical characteristics of computer science professors. Given the sample sizes (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to Jason being in the computer science group. However, this estimation also considers that humanities professors can occasionally have similar interests, hence the probability is not as high as 1 but reasonably elevated.
