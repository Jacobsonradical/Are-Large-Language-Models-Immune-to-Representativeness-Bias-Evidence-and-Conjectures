To determine the most probable category for Jason—whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor—we start by using Bayes' theorem. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that a professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to consider how likely the given description is for both computer science professors and humanities professors.
   - Descriptions of hobbies and interests such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and avoiding drawing and writing are more characteristic of a computer science professor. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is likely higher than \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \).
   
   While we do not know the exact likelihood values without more detailed data, it is reasonable to assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is significantly greater.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups, and
