To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the provided description, it's helpful to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor (CS) at random from the total sample: \( P(CS) \).
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor (H) at random from the total sample: \( P(H) \).

   Considering the sample size:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Probability of seeing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor: \( P(description \mid CS) \).
   - Probability of seeing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor: \( P(description \mid H) \).

   Given the description, it seems more likely to align with traits commonly associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying writing). For the sake of this example, let's assume:
   \[
   P(description \mid CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(description \mid H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability** (Bayes' Theorem application):
   - We need to find \( P(CS \mid description) \).

   Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{P(description \mid CS) \
