{"probability": "0.75"}

Here is the reasoning: 
The total number of professors is 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities).
Given the description, Jasonâ€™s interests and traits (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) align more with a typical computer science professor. Proportionately, 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science.

Using Bayes' theorem can give us the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:

P(CS | description) = (P(description | CS) * P(CS)) / P(description)

Where:
- P(CS) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(description | CS) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (assumed to be high)
- P(description) will be normalized across both groups

Without precise values of P(description | CS) and P(description), the prior probability still heavily influences the estimate.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate leans towards the prior probability:
{"probability": "0.75"}
