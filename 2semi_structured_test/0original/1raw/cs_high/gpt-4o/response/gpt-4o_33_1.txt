{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is calculated using the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study, weighted by the description's alignment with typical characteristics more commonly associated with computer science professors. In this case, Jasonâ€™s interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly align with computer science professors, while his lack of interest in writing detracts from a profile more typical of humanities professors.
