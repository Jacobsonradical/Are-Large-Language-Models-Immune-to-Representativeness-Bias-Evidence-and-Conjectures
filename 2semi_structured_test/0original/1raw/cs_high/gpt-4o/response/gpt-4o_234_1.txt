{"probability": "0.75"}

Here's the reasoning: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the base rates are 75% for computer science and 25% for humanities. Given Jason's description, which includes an affinity for coding and mathematical puzzles—interests more commonly associated with computer science—the probability that Jason is a computer science professor should logically align with the higher base rate. Therefore, a probability of 0.75 (or 75%) seems reasonable.
