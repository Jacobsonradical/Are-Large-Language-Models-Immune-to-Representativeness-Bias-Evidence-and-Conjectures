Based on the description provided for Jason, it appears to align more closely with traits that might be commonly associated with a computer science professor, especially due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor is 75/100 or 0.75.

Considering Jason's characteristics and interests, it seems more likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Therefore, we would increase our probability assessment above the prior probability to reflect this alignment.

Taking this into account, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{"probability": "0.9"}
