Given the description of Jason and knowing the composition of the sample, let's apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's establish our prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is in humanities (P(HU)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Now, let's consider how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Since the description includes interests and traits more typically associated with computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles, being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious), we can reasonably assume that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

Let's assign a likelihood ratio based on the description fitting computer science professors more closely. We can assume a stronger correlation for simplicity:
- P(Description | CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood that a CS professor fits this description)
- P(Description | HU) = 0.1 (low likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description)

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | HU) * P(HU)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.
