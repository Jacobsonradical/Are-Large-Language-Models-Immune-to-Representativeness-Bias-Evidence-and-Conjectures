Based on the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to evaluate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. 

We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Assuming the description aligns more closely with typical traits of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, does not enjoy drawing or writing), we can proceed with an estimation. 

The base rate is:
- Prior probability of picking a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75
- Prior probability of picking a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25

Given Jason's traits which align more with a computer science professor's general profile, we will assume a higher likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor. 

Let's say the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor (P(Traits|CS)) is higher than a humanities professor (P(Traits|HU)). For simplicity and without exact probability distributions, we might estimate:

P(Traits|CS) ≈ 0.9
P(Traits|HU) ≈ 0.1

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

P(CS|Traits) = [P(Traits|CS) * P(CS)] / [P(Traits|CS) * P(CS) + P(Traits|HU) * P(HU)]

= [0.9 * 0.75] / [(0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25)]
= 0.675 / (0.675 + 0.025)
= 0.675 / 0.7
≈ 0.964
