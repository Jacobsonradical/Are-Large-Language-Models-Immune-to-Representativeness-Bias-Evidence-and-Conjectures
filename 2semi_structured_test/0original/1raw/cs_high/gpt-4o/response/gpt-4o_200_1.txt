{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his creative thinking, align more closely with typical interests and traits associated with computer science professors rather than humanities professors. Given that there are three times as many computer science professors in the sample (75) compared to humanities professors (25), the likelihood of Jason being one of the computer science professors is greater. The combination of his interests and the distribution of the sample suggests a 75% probability that he is a computer science professor.
