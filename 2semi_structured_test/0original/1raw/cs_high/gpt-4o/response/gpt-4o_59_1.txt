{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the base rate information provided (75% of the professors are in computer science, and 25% are in the humanities). Jason's interests and traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggest a higher likelihood of him being in computer science, thus reinforcing the base rate. However, without additional specific information favoring one field over the other conclusively, the probability remains close to the base rate.
