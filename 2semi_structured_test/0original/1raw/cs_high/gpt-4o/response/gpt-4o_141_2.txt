Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely associated with computer science, we should consider the relative proportions of computer science professors to humanities professors in our sample. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the base rate probability before considering personal characteristics (75/100 for computer science and 25/100 for humanities).

Jason's interests and characteristics strongly align with those typically associated with the field of computer science. Thus, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to Jason being a computer science professor.

Based on this analysis, our updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor would reflect both the base rate and the alignment of his hobbies and behavior with the typical profile of a computer science professor. Given the evidence, we might estimate this probability to be quite high.
