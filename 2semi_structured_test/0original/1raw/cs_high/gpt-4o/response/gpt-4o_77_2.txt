To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the base rates (priors) and the likelihood of the description given the profession.

First, we have:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

This gives the base rates:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we consider the likelihood of the description given the profession. The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor.

Let's assume:
- Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (P(Description|CS)): For simplicity, let's say it is high, like 0.9 because of notable alignment with typical activities of that field.
- Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (P(Description|H)): For simplicity, let's say it is low, like 0.1 because these activities are not typically associated with that field.

Now, we calculate the normalized probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|H) \times P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
