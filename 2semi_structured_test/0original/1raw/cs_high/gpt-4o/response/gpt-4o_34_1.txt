Given the information provided about Jason, we can use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that he is one of the computer science professors.

We know that there are two groups in the study:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods of Jason's description given each group. Jason's description fits stereotypical traits often associated with computer science (such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) and less so with humanities. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume the likelihood of Jason's description being from a computer science professor, \( P(Description | CS) \), is higher than from a humanities professor, \( P(Description | Hum) \).

While exact values for these likelihoods are not given, for simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(Description | Hum) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS
