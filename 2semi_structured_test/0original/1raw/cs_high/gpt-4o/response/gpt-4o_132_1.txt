{"probability": "0.75"}

This probability is based on the description provided and the knowledge that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are typically more associated with computer science than the humanities, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. Hence, the probability is calculated as follows:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

Given that Jason's characteristics align more with computer science, we use the ratio of computer science professors to total professors:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
