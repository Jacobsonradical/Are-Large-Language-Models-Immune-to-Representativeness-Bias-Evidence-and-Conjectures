Given the description, Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, coupled with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a strong alignment with characteristics and hobbies often associated with computer science professionals rather than humanities professors. 

Additionally, based on the sample size, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor 75% and a humanities professor 25%.

Using Bayes' Theorem to incorporate both these priors and the described traits, we would lean heavily towards identifying Jason as a computer science professor. The description significantly matches traits more commonly associated with computer science, which would further increase the posterior probability.

So, we can confidently assert a high probability.
