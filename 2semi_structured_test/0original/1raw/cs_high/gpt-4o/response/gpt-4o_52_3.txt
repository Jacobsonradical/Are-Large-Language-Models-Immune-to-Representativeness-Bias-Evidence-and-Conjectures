Given the description of Jason's interests and attributes, especially his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it is reasonable to assume that these traits are more strongly associated with computer science professionals compared to humanities professors. Here we can use Bayes' Theorem to better inform our estimate, but we'll make a simplified heuristic argument.

In the sample, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving us a prior probability of 75/100 for Jason being in computer science.

Considering Jason's interests and personality traits:
1. Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is highly indicative of a computer science professional.
2. Not enjoying drawing or writing aligns less with common traits we may expect among humanities professors.

These factors substantially increase the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor.

Thus, a strong but simplified estimate can be made:

{"probability": "0.9"}
