To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which takes into account the prior probability and the likelihood of the given evidence.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability of a professor being from computer science (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of a professor being from the humanities (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we consider the likelihood of observing Jason's characteristics in computer science vs humanities. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more strongly associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his dislike for drawing or writing, more common in humanities, supports this prediction further towards computer science.

Although the exact likelihoods are not provided, we can infer that Jason's characteristics are strongly indicative of a computer science professor, given his interest in coding and mathematical puzzles. Let’s assume the likelihoods are as follows:
- Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (P(description | CS)) ≈ 0.9
- Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (P(description | H)) ≈ 0.1

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \
