Based on the description provided, Jason's characteristics and interests such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging seem to align more closely with the typical activities and personality traits associated with computer science professors. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, there is a higher base rate for Jason being a computer science professor.

Given this information and the alignment of Jason's interests with computer science, I would estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

{"probability": "0.95"}
