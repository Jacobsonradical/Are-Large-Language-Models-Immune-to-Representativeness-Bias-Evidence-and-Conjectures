{"probability": "0.75"}

Given the description of Jason and the number of professors in each field, we can use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability.

First, we consider the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H), making the prior probabilities:
  - P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
  - P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we examine the description of Jason, which aligns more closely with typical characteristics of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.).

Given that the description seems highly indicative of someone in computer science, we assume that the likelihood of a computer science professor having this description, P(description | CS), is very high, close to 1, whereas the likelihood of a humanities professor having this description, P(description | H), is much lower, close to 0.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

However, for simplification, assuming P(description | CS) is significantly higher than P(description | H), we conclude that Jason is indeed more likely to be a computer science professor.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.
