Given the description of Jason, we should consider two aspects to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors: base rates (prior probabilities) and the degree to which Jason's traits match the characteristics of a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

1. **Base Rates (Prior Probabilities):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Total: 100 professors.

Therefore, the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75, and the probability of being a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Matching Characteristics:**
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science.
   - His dislike for drawing and writing also aligns more with a computer science profile rather than a humanities profile.

Given Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles and his disinterest in drawing or writing, his description strongly matches the typical profile of a computer science professor.

Combining the base rate with the matching characteristics and the strong indicators pointing toward computer science, we can refine the probability:

{"probability": "0.95"}
