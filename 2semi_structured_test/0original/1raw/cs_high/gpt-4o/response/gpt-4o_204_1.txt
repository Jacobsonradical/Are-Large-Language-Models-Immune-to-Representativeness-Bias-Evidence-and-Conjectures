Given the description provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability based on evidence.

1. **Prior probability**: The initial probability of Jason being a computer science professor (CS) is based on the number of CS professors in the study.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   Similarly, the initial probability of Jason being a humanities professor (H) is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**: The likelihood is the probability of the description given the professor's field. Jason's traits (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, creativity in non-arts activities) are more aligned with computer science. We can subjectively assign higher likelihood to these traits occurring in CS professors over humanities professors.

    For simplicity, assume:
   \[
   P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Normalizing factor**: The total probability of the description occurring regardless of the field.
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
