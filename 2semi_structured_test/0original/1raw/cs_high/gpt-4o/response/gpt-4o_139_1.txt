{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this probability:
- The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science rather than the humanities.
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, making the base probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor 0.75 (75 out of 100).
- Given that the description strongly aligns with interests and activities more common in computer science, it seems reasonable to infer that the probability of Jason being a computer science professor is higher than 0.5. 
- Therefore, combining these factors gives a probability of 0.75 that Jason is a computer science professor.
