{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given Jason's interests and traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it suggests a higher likelihood of him being in the computer science field compared to the humanities. Also, considering there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, the base rate for being a computer science professor is 0.75. Thus, combining the base rate with the profile description leads to a high probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
