{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
While the given information does not guarantee that Jason is a computer science professor, several aspects of his personality and interests suggest that he is more likely to be one:
- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists.
- Despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be seen as less common traits for humanities professors.
- Although not definitive, his conservative and careful nature may be more prevalent in the computer science field compared to humanities.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor at 0.85. However, it is important to note that this estimate is not based on a comprehensive analysis of the data and could be influenced by various biases.
