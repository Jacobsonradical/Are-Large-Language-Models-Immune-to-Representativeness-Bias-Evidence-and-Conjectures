The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These interests align more closely with the field of computer science than with the humanities. Additionally, while Jason is described as highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities that are often associated with the humanities. Therefore, it is likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
