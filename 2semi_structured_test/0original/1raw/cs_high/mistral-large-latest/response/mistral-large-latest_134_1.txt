{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the information provided in the description. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, since the information is not definitive, I assigned a probability of 0.85 rather than 1.
