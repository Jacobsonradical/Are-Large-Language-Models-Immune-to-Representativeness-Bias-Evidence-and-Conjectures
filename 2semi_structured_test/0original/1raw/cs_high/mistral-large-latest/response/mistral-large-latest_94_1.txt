{"probability": "0.85"}

The description provided suggests that Jason has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are commonly associated with the field of computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical and abstract tasks, which are also common in computer science. Therefore, it is highly probable that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be successful humanities professors who share similar traits and interests.
