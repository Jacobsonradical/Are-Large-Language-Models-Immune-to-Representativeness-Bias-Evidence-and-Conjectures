{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. He also does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate a preference for more technical and abstract thinking, as opposed to the creative and subjective thinking often required in the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as interests and personality traits do not guarantee a person's field of study or profession.
