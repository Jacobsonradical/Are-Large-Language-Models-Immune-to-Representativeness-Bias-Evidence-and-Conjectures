The description of Jason as someone who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and that there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with an atypical set of interests.
