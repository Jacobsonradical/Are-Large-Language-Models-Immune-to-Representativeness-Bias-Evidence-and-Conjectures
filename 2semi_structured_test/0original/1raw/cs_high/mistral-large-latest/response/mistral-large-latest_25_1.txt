{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the information given in the description. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, since the description does not provide any definitive information about his field of study, I cannot be absolutely certain, hence the probability is less than 1.
