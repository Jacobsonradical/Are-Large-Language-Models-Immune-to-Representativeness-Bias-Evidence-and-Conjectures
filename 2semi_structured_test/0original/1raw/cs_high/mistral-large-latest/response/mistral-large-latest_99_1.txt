{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the given information, it seems that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are often associated with humanities professors, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is not a definitive conclusion, as there can be exceptions and variations in individual interests and abilities. Therefore, a probability of 0.85 is assigned to the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
