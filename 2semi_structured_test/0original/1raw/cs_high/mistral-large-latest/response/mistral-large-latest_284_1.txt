{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skill set typically found in computer science professors. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, it is not a certainty, as some humanities professors may have similar traits, so the probability is not 1.
