{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason's interests and personality traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, aligns more closely with the typical characteristics of a computer science professor. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, the probability is not 1 because there is still a chance that a humanities professor could have these traits and interests.
