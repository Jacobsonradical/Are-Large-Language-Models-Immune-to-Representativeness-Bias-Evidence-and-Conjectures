{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, activities that are often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it's not a certainty, hence the probability is less than 1.
