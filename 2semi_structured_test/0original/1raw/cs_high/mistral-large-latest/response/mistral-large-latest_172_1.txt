{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason's interests and hobbies, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities, further supports this assumption. However, the probability is not 100% certain because personality traits alone do not definitively determine one's academic field.
