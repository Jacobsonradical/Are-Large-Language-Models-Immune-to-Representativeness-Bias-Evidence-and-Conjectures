Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty, as there could be humanities professors with similar interests.
