The given description of Jason suggests that he is a conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. Although he is highly creative, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could imply that his creativity is more inclined towards technical and logical thinking rather than artistic or literary pursuits.

Considering these traits, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that the probability provided is an estimation based on the given information and not a definitive answer, as there could be exceptions where a person with such traits can also be successful in the humanities.
