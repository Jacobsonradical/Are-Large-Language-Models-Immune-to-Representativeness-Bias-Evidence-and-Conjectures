{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have traits and interests that are more commonly associated with computer science professors. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggests a stronger inclination towards the technical field of computer science. However, it is important to note that this is just a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities with a unique set of interests.
