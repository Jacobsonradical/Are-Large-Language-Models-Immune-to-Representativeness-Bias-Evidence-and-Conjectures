{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong interest in logical and mathematical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits among computer science professors. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing might indicate a preference for quantitative over qualitative subjects. However, it is essential to note that this is a probabilistic guess and not a certainty, as there is no definitive way to determine Jason's field based solely on this description.
