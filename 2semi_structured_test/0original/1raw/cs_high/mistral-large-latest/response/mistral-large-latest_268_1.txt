{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason appears to have traits and interests more commonly associated with computer science professors, such as a love for coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may suggest a preference for technical and analytical tasks over creative and artistic ones, which could also be more indicative of a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty, as there are always exceptions and individual differences among people.
