{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his personality traits of being careful, ambitious, and highly creative are often associated with successful academics in STEM fields. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 0.85.
