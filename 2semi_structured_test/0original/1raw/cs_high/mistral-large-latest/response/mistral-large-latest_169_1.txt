{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, since the description does not provide any direct information about Jason's field of study or occupation, the probability cannot be 1.0.
