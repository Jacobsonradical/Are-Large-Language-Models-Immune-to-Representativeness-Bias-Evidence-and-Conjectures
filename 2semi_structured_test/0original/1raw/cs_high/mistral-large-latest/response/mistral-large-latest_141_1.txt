{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a strong affiliation with the computer science field. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might indicate a preference for the logical and analytical aspects of computer science over the more subjective and creative aspects of the humanities. However, it is essential to note that this is only a probability, as personality traits and interests alone cannot definitively determine a person's academic field.
