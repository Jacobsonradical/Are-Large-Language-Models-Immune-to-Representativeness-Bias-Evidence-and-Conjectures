{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there may be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.
