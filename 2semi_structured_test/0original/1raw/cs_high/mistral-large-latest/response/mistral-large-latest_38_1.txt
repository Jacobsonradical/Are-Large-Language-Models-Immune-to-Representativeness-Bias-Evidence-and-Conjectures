{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the information provided in the description. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, combined with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor. Additionally, the description mentions that he is ambitious and talented, traits that could be beneficial in either field but may be more commonly associated with the competitive nature of computer science. However, it is important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests and hobbies.
