{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, align more closely with the skills and activities typically associated with computer science. However, it is not a certainty, hence the probability is less than 1.
