{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the provided information, it seems that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits among computer science professors. Although being creative could also indicate a connection to humanities, his lack of interest in drawing or writing leans more towards a non-humanities discipline. Additionally, the sample size of computer science professors in the study was larger than that of humanities professors, which might also influence the probability. However, it's essential to note that this is a subjective probability, and individual traits alone may not definitively determine one's academic field.
