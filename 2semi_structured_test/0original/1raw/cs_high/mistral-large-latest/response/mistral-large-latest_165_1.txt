{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science than humanities. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, activities often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there can be exceptions to these general trends.
