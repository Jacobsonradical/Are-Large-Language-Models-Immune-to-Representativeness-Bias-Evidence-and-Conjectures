{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. However, as the study includes both computer science and humanities professors, and the sample size is not very large, there is still a small possibility that he could be a humanities professor with an unusual interest in coding and mathematical puzzles. Therefore, I assigned a probability of 0.85, indicating a high but not absolute certainty that Jason is a computer science professor.
