The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in logical and mathematical activities, such as coding and solving puzzles, which are commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy more humanities-related activities like drawing or writing. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it is not a certainty, hence the probability is not 1.
