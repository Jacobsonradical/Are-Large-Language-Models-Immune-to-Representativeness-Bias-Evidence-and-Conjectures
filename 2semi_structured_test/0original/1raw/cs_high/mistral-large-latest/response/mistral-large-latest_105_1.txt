{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills highly relevant to computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor, as these activities are more commonly associated with the humanities. However, the probability is not 100% as there is still a chance that a professor in the humanities could have these traits.
