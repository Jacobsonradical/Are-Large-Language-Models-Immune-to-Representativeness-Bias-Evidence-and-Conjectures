{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Jason is described as talented, ambitious, and enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are traits that could be associated with a successful computer science professor. The fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is a probability-based assessment, and individual cases may vary. Additionally, the sample size of the study was relatively small, and the descriptions were based on personality tests and interviews, which may not fully capture the complexity of each individual.
