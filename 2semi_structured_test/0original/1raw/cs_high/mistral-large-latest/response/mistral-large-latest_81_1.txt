{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
Based on the description provided, Jason seems to possess several traits that are commonly associated with successful computer science professors. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities often associated with the computer science field. Additionally, his conservative and careful nature may suggest a meticulous approach to problem-solving, which is valuable in computer science. The fact that he is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing may also suggest a more technical and analytical orientation. However, since the description does not provide any direct information about his field of study or teaching, it is still possible, although less likely, that Jason is a humanities professor. Thus, I estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors to be high but not certain, at 0.85.
