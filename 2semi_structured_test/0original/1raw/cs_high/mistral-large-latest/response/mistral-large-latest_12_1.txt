{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
Based on the description, Jason has several traits that align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor. He is described as conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, and enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. While these traits do not guarantee that he is a computer science professor, they do make it more likely. Additionally, the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities, further supports the hypothesis that he is a computer science professor. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be around 85%.
