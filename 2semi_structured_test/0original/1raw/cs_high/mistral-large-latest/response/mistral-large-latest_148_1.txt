{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate a preference for more technical and analytical tasks over creative and humanistic ones. Therefore, it is highly likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is still possible that he could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests, so the probability is not 100%.
