{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Given the description of Jason's interests and personality traits, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns well with the skillset and interests typically found in computer science professors. Although creativity is valued in both fields, his lack of interest in drawing or writing might suggest a lower likelihood of his being a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that the probability is not 1, as there could still be a chance that Jason is a humanities professor with a unique set of interests and skills.
