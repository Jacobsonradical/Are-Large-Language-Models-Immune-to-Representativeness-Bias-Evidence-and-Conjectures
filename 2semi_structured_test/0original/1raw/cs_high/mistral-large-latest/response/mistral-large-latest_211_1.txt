{"probability": "0.9"}

The description of Jason's interests and hobbies, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, aligns more closely with the typical traits of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, and there may be exceptions to these general traits among professors in both fields.
