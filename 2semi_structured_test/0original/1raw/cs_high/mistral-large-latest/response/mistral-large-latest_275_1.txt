{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his personality traits of being careful, talented, and ambitious can be beneficial for a career in computer science. However, the probability is not 100% because there is still a possibility that a humanities professor shares these same interests and traits.
