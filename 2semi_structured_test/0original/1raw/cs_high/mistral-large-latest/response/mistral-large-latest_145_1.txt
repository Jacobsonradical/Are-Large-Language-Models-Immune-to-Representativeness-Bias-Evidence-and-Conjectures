{"probability": "0.9"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities that are highly logical and analytical, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer scientists. Although the description does not provide direct evidence of his academic field, his interests and personality traits align more closely with those typically associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors. Additionally, the fact that the sample size of computer science professors is larger (75 versus 25 humanities professors) also contributes to a higher probability. However, it is not possible to determine with absolute certainty based on the information provided, so the probability is not 1.
