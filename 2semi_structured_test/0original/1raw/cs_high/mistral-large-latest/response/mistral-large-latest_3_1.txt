Explanation: Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more with the skills and hobbies typically found in computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing might suggest a preference for more technical and analytical tasks, which are common in computer science. The conservative and careful personality traits could be found in either discipline, but ambitiousness and creativity are valued in both fields. Based on this information, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
