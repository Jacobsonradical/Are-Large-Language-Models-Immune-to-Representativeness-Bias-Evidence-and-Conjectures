{"probability": "0.9"}

The description of Jason as a person who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, but not drawing or writing, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his conservativeness and carefulness may be traits that are more common among computer scientists, who often have to work with precise and complex systems. However, since this is just a probability and not a certainty, I have left some room for doubt by not assigning a probability of 1.0.
