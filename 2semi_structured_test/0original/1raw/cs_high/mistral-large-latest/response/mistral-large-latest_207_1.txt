{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the provided information, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skillset and hobbies commonly found among computer science professors. Although creativity can be found in both fields, his disinterest in drawing and writing leans him further away from the humanities. Additionally, his conservative and careful nature might be more fitting for the methodical and structured field of computer science. Therefore, I assign a probability of 0.85 for Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample.
