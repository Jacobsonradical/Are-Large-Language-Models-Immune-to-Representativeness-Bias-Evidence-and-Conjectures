{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, the probability is not 1, as it is still possible for a humanities professor to have these traits and interests.
