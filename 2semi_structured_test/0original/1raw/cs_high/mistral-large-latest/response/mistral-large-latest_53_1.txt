{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, it is mentioned that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities that might be more commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, based on this information, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that personality traits and interests alone cannot definitively determine a person's academic field, and there may be successful humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles. Therefore, the probability is not 100%, but still relatively high.
