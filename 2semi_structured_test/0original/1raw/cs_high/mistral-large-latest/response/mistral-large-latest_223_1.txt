Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, coupled with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is not a certainty and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
