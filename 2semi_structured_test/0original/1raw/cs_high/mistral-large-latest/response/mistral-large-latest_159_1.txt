{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his conservative and careful personality traits, align more with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is a probability based on stereotypes and common traits, and not a definitive answer.
