{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong affinity for logical and mathematical activities, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically associated with the computer science field. Although creativity can be present in both computer science and humanities professors, Jason's lack of interest in drawing and writing makes it less likely that he is a humanities professor. Furthermore, the sample size for computer science professors was larger than that of humanities professors, which may also influence the probability. Therefore, it seems more probable that Jason is a computer science professor.
