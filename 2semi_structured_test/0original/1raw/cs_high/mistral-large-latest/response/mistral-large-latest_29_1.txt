Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the computer science field. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing could suggest that he is less likely to be in the humanities. However, it is important to acknowledge that there is still a chance he could be a humanities professor with unique hobbies, hence the probability is not 1.
