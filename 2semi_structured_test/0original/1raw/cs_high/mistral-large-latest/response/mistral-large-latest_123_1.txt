{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports this assumption, as these activities are more commonly associated with the humanities. However, since we don't have information about the prevalence of these traits among successful professors in each field, it's impossible to assign a precise probability. The given probability is an educated guess based on the provided information.
