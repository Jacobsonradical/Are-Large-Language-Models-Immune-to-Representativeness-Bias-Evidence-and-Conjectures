{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical or analytical tasks, which are also common in computer science. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a chance that Jason is a professor in the humanities.
