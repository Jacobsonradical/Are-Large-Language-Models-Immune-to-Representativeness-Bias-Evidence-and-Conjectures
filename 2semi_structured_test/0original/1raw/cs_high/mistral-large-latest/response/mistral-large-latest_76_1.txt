{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason seems to have personality traits and interests that align more closely with a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a stronger affinity for technical and analytical tasks. However, since the description is not definitive, I assigned a probability of 0.85, indicating a high likelihood, but not a certainty, that Jason is a computer science professor.
