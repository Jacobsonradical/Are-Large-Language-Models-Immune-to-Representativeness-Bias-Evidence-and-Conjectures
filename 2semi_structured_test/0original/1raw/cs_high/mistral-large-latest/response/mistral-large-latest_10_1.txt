{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with humanities professors. Therefore, it's more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it's not a certainty, hence the probability of 0.85 instead of 1.
