{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These interests align more closely with the field of computer science than with the humanities. Additionally, Jason is described as highly creative but not in the context of drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, as there can be exceptions within any field.
