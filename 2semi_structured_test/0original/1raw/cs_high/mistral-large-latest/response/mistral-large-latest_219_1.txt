{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The characteristics of enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with a lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, this prediction is not certain, as some humanities professors could also have these interests. Therefore, I assigned a high but not perfect probability.
