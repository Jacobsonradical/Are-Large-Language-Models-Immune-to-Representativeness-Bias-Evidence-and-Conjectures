{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there can be exceptions and overlaps in interests and personality traits between professors in different fields.
