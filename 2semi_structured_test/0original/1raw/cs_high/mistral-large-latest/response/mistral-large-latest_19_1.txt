{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate that he is less likely to be a professor in the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and there may be exceptions to these general trends.
