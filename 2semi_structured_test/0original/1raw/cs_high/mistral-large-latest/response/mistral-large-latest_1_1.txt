{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, the fact that he enjoys jogging and has a conservative personality might indicate a preference for the structured and logical nature of computer science over the more creative and subjective nature of the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with an unusual combination of interests and personality traits.
