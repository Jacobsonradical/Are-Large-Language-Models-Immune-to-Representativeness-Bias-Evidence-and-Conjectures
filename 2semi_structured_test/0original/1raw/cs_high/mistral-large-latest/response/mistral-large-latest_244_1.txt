{"probability": "0.9"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests and personality traits seem more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, coupled with his disinterest in drawing or writing, suggest a strong affinity for the logical and analytical aspects of computer science. Additionally, his ambition and talent may have helped him achieve success in this field. Therefore, I would estimate a high probability (0.9) that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
