{"probability": "0.85"}

The description provided suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing might indicate a preference for more technical and analytical tasks, which are often more prevalent in computer science than in the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also share these traits and interests.
