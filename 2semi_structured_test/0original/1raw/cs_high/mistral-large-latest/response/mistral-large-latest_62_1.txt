{"probability": "0.9"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason appears to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is still an educated guess and not a certainty, hence the probability of 0.9 instead of 1.
