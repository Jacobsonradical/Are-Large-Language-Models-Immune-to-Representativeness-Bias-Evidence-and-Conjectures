{"probability": "0.9"}

Explanation: The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. While Jason's personality traits of being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious could potentially be found in either field, the specific activities he enjoys make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. However, it is not a certainty, so the probability is not 1.
