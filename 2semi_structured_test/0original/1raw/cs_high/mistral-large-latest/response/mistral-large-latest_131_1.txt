{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information given about Jason, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. His interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skillset and hobbies typically associated with computer science professors. The fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing also supports this assumption, as these activities are more commonly associated with humanities professors. However, the probability is not 100% because there is still a chance that a humanities professor could have similar interests and hobbies.
