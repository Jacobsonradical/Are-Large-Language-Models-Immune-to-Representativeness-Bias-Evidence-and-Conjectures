{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing may indicate a preference for more technical and abstract tasks over creative and expressive ones. Therefore, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty.
