{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information given in the description, it appears that Jason has a strong interest in technical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. This suggests that he is more likely to be a professor in the field of computer science rather than the humanities. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports this conclusion. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be relatively high, at around 0.85. However, it is important to note that this is only an estimate and that there may be other factors not mentioned in the description that could influence Jason's field of study.
