{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his conservative and careful nature, align more closely with the stereotypical traits of a computer science professor. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing further suggests that he may not be a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on stereotypes and individual traits can vary greatly within each field. Therefore, the probability is not 100%, but still relatively high.
