{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
Based on the description provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. While ambition, talent, and creativity are common traits among successful academics in both computer science and humanities, the specific interests mentioned in the description lean more towards computer science. However, it's not an absolute certainty, so I've assigned a high but not perfect probability.
