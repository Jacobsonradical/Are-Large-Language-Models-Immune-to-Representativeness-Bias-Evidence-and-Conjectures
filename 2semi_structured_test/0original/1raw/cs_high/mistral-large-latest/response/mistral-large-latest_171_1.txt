{"probability": "0.9"}

Explanation:
Jason's personality description and interests align more with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities. Therefore, I estimate a high probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group.
