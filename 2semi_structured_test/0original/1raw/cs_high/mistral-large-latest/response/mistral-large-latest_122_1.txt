{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason seems to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills and interests typically associated with computer science professors. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is not definitive evidence, and there is still a small chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors in the sample to be around 0.85.
