{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests a strong interest in logical and technical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which aligns more with the computer science field. Jason's lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. However, it is not a certainty, hence a probability slightly lower than 1.
