{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong inclination towards logical and analytical activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, activities that are often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also share these traits.
