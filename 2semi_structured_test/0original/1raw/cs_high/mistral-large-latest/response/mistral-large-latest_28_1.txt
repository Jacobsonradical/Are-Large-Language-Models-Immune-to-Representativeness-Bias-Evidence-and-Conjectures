{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the following reasoning:

1. The description provides information about Jason's interests and personality traits.
2. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more commonly associated with computer science professors.
3. Although Jason is highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may suggest that his creativity is more focused on logical and analytical pursuits, rather than artistic ones.
4. Considering these factors, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. However, it is not impossible for a humanities professor to have these interests and traits, so I assigned a probability of 0.85 to indicate a high likelihood, but not a certainty.
