{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skillset and hobbies typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with atypical interests.
