The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also supports this assumption. Therefore, it is highly probable that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, since the description does not provide any information about his teaching or research experience in computer science, there is still a small chance that he might be a professor in the humanities who happens to enjoy coding and mathematics as hobbies.
