{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the information provided in the description. Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his conservative and careful nature, align more closely with the stereotypical traits of a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
