Explanation: The description of Jason indicates that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may suggest a preference for technical and logical tasks over artistic or humanistic pursuits. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is not a certainty, and there is still a possibility that he is a humanities professor with a unique set of interests.
