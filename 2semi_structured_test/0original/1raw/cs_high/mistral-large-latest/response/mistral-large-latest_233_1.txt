{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could suggest that his creativity is more focused on technical rather than artistic pursuits. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is likely higher than the probability that he is a humanities professor. However, it's not certain, hence the probability of 0.85.
