{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason's personality traits and interests, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, the probability is not 100% as it is possible for a humanities professor to also have these interests and traits.
