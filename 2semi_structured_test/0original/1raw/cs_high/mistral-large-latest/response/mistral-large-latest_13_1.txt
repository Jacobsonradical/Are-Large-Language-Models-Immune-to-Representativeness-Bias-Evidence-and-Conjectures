The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may indicate that his creativity is more analytical and technical in nature. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and it is still possible that Jason may be a professor in the humanities with similar interests and characteristics.
