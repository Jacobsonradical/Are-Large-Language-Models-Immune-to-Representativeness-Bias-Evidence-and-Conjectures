{"probability": "0.85"}

The given description suggests that Jason is highly analytical, enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and is less interested in creative activities like drawing or writing. These traits are more commonly associated with computer science professors, making it more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is still possible that he could be a humanities professor with a strong interest in mathematical puzzles and coding, so the probability is not 1.0.
