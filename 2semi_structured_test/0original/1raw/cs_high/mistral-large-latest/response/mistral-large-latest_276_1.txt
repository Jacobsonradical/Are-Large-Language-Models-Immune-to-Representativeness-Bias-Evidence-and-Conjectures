{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skill set and preferences commonly found in computer science professors. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing suggests he may be less likely to be a professor in the humanities, although this is not a definitive indicator. The probability of 0.8 reflects a high likelihood, but still leaves room for the possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
