{"probability": "0.85"}

The description provided suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also aligns more with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is a probability-based assessment and that there are always exceptions to the rule.
