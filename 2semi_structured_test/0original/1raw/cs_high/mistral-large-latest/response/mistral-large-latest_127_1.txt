{"probability": "0.85"}

The given description of Jason suggests that he is a conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These traits and interests align more closely with the expected characteristics of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that the probability is not 1, as there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with an atypical interest in coding and mathematical puzzles.
