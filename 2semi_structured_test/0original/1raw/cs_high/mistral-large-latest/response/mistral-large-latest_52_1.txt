{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason as a conservative, careful, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The fact that he is not interested in drawing or writing further supports this hypothesis. However, it is important to note that this is not a certainty and that there is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor with an interest in coding and mathematics. Therefore, I have assigned a probability of 0.85 to the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor.
