{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests a strong interest in logic and problem-solving activities, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These interests are more commonly associated with the field of computer science than with the humanities. Additionally, Jason's lack of interest in drawing and writing, which are more creative pursuits often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there are always exceptions to general trends and interests.
