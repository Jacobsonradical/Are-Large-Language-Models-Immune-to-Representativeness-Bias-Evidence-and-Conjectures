{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. The probability of 0.85 reflects a high degree of confidence in this assessment, but still leaves room for the possibility that Jason may belong to the humanities department, given the limited information available.
