{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests and personality traits seem to align more closely with those of a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests a strong interest in technical and logical problem-solving, which is central to computer science. Furthermore, his lack of interest in drawing or writing suggests that he may not be as interested in the humanities, which often involve creative expression through writing or visual art. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests and skills.
