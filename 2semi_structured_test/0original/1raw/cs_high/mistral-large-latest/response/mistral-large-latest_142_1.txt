{"probability": "0.8"}

Explanation: The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be activities more commonly associated with the humanities. The fact that he is described as "conservative" and "careful" could also suggest a preference for the structured and logical nature of computer science over the more subjective and interpretive nature of the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate based on the given information, and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
