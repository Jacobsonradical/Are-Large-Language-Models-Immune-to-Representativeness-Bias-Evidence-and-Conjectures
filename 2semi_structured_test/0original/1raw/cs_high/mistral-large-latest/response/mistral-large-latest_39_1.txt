Explanation: Based on the given information, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more with the stereotypical traits of a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that personality traits alone do not determine one's academic field, and there is still a possibility that Jason could be a humanities professor despite these stereotypes.
