{"probability": "0.8"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate a preference for more analytical and technical tasks, which are often found in computer science. However, it is important to note that this is just a probability and not a certainty, as there can be exceptions and overlaps in interests and skills between different academic fields.
