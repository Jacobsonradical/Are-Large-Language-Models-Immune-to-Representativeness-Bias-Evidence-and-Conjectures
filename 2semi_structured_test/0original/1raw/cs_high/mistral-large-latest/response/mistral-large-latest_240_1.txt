The description of Jason as a conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles but not drawing or writing suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, this is not a certainty and there is still a small chance that he could be a humanities professor with a strong interest in coding and mathematics.
