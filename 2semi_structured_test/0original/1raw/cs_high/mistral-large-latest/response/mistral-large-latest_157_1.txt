{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he is a careful, talented, and ambitious individual who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles. These traits and interests align more closely with those of a computer science professor, hence the high probability. However, it is still possible that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of hobbies, hence the probability is not 1.
