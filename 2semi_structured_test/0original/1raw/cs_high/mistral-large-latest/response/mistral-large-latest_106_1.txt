{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason as a person who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests.
