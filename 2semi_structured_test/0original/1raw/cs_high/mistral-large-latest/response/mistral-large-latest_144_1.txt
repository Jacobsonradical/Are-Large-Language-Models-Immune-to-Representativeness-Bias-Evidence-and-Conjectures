{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests for computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may suggest that he is less likely to be in the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is just a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities who happens to have these interests.
