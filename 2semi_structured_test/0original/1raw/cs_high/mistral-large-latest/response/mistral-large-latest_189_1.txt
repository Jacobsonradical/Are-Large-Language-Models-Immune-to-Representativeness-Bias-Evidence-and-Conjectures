{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a strong affinity for technical and analytical tasks, which are more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports the idea that he may be more likely to be a computer science professor. However, it's important to note that this is only a probability, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities with a unique set of interests.
