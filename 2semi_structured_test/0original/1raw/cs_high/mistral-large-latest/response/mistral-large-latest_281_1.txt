{"probability": "0.85"}

The description provided suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing could also indicate a preference for the more technical and logical aspects of computer science over the more creative and subjective aspects of the humanities. Furthermore, the fact that he is careful and ambitious could also be traits that are beneficial for a career in computer science, where attention to detail and the drive to constantly improve and innovate are highly valued. Therefore, based on this information, it seems likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and there is still a chance that Jason could be a professor in the humanities.
