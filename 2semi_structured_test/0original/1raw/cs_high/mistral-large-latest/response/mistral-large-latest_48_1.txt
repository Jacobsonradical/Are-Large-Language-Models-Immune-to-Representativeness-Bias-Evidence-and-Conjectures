{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate that his creativity is more focused on technical and logical tasks rather than artistic or humanistic pursuits. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is not a certainty, and hence the probability is less than 1.
