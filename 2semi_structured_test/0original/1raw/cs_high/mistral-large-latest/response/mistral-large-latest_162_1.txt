{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate that he is less likely to be a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty. There may be humanities professors who also enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles, and there may be computer science professors who enjoy drawing and writing. The probability of 0.85 reflects a high but not absolute likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given information.
