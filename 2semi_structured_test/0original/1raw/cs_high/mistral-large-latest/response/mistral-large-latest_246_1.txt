{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
While there is no definitive way to determine Jason's field based solely on the given information, some traits and interests may suggest a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor. Traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being talented and ambitious could be more commonly associated with professionals in the computer science field. However, it is important to note that this is not a guarantee, as individuals in the humanities may also share these traits and interests. Therefore, the probability assigned reflects a relatively high but not absolute certainty.
