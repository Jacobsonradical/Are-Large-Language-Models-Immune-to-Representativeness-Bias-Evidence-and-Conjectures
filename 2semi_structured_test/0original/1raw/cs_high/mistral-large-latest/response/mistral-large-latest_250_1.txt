{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in logical and mathematical activities, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common traits among computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are activities often associated with the humanities, further supports the likelihood that he is a computer science professor. However, the probability is not 100% because there is still a chance that a professor in humanities could also have similar traits.
