{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his conservative personality make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. However, since this is not definitive proof and there is a possibility that he may be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests, I assigned a high but not absolute probability.
