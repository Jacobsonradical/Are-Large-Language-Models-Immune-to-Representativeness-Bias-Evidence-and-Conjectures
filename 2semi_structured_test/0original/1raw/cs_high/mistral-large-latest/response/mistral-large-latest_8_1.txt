{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his careful and ambitious nature seem more aligned with the personality traits of a computer science professor. However, it is not a guarantee, as some humanities professors may also have similar traits. The probability of 0.85 reflects a high likelihood, but still leaves room for the possibility that he is a humanities professor.
