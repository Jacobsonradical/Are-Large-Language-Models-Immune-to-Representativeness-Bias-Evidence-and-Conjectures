{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason's interests and traits appear to align more closely with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggest a stronger affinity for technical and analytical tasks. However, it's important to note that this is a probability, not a certainty, and individual cases may vary.
