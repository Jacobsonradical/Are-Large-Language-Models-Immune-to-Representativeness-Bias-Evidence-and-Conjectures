{"probability": "0.85"}

The description indicates that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of enjoyment for drawing and writing also supports the idea that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that this is not definitive evidence, hence the probability is not 1.
