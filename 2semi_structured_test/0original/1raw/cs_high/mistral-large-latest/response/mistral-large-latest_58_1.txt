Explanation: Based on the description provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the skill set and hobbies often found in computer science professors. While it is not impossible for a humanities professor to enjoy these activities, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. The fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are common activities in humanities, further supports this probability.
