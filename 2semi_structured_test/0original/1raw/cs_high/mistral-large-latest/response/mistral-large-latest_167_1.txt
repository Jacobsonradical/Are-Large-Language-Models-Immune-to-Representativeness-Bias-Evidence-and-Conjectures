{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science professors. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing may indicate a preference for more analytical and technical tasks, which are also characteristic of computer science professors. While it is not possible to determine with absolute certainty whether Jason is a computer science professor based on this description alone, the probability that he is one seems relatively high.
