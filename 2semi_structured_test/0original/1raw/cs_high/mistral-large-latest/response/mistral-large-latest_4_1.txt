{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests he enjoys activities related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests for computer science professors. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate a preference for the more analytical and technical aspects of computer science over the more creative and expressive aspects of the humanities. However, it is important to note that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as individuals in both fields can have diverse interests and personality traits.
