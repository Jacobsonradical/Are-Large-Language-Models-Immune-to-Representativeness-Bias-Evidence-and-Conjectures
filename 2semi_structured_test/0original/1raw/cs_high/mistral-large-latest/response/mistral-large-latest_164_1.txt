{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the given description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, as well as his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his personality traits of being careful and ambitious may be more common in the computer science field. However, it is important to note that personality traits and interests alone cannot definitively determine one's academic field, hence the probability is not 1.
