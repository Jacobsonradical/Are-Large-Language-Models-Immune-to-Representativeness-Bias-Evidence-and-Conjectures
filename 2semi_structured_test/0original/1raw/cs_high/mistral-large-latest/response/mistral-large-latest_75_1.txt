{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason mentions that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. Therefore, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, the probability is not 1, as there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with an unusual set of interests.
