{"probability": "0.85"}

Given the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a strong affinity towards computer science and related fields. While not definitive, this makes it more likely that he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it is important to note that the probability is not 100% as there is still a chance he could be a humanities professor with a unique set of hobbies.
