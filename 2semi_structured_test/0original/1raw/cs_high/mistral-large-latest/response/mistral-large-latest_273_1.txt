The description of Jason's interests and personality traits suggests a higher likelihood that he is a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and ambition align with traits often found in successful computer science professors. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing and writing further supports this assumption. However, it's not an absolute certainty, as there is a possibility that a humanities professor may have similar interests and traits.
