{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities typically associated with computer science. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could indicate a preference for the logical and analytical nature of computer science over the more subjective and interpretive nature of the humanities. However, it's important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as there could be professors in the humanities who also enjoy coding and mathematics.
