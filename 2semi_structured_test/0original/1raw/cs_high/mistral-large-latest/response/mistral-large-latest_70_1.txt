{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his high level of creativity suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing and writing may indicate that he is less likely to be a humanities professor. However, the probability is not 1 because there is still a possibility that a humanities professor could have these traits and interests.
