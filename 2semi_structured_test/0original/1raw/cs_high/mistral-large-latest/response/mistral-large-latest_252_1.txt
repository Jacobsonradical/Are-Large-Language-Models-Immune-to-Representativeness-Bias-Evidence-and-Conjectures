{"probability": "0.85"}

My answer is based on the information provided in the description, which suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, both of which are skills commonly associated with computer science professors. However, it should be noted that this is only a probability and not a certainty, as there is always a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of hobbies and interests.
