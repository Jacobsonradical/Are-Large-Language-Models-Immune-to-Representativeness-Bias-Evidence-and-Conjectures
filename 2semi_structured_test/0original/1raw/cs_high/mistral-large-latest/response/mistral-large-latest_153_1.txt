{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The information provided suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing might indicate a preference for quantitative and logical tasks over qualitative and creative ones. However, it is important to note that the description does not provide any direct information about Jason's profession, and there is still a possibility that he could be a professor in the humanities. Therefore, the probability assigned reflects a high but not absolute certainty that Jason is a computer science professor.
