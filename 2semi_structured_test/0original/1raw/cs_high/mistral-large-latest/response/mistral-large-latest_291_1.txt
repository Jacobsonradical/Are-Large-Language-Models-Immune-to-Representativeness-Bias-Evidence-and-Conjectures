{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the description, Jason appears to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing and writing may also suggest a preference for more analytical and technical tasks over creative and humanistic pursuits. Additionally, his conservative and careful personality traits may be more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore, I estimate that Jason has an 85% probability of being one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that this is only an estimate, and individual personalities and interests can vary widely within any field of study.
