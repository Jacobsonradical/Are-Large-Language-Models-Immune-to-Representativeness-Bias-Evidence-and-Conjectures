The given description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities that are more commonly associated with computer science than the humanities. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this conclusion. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. However, it is important to note that personality traits alone cannot perfectly predict academic discipline, so there is still some uncertainty in this prediction.
