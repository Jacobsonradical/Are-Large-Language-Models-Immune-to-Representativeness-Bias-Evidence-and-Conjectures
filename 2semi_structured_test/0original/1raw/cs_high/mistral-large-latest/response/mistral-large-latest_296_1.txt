{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:

- Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggests he is more likely to be a computer science professor.
- His lack of interest in drawing and writing makes him less likely to be a humanities professor.
- However, there is still a small chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with a unique set of interests, hence the probability is not 1.
