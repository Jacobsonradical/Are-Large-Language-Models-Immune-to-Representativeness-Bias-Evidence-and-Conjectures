{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Jason's personality traits, such as being talented, ambitious, and enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, strongly suggest he is a computer science professor. His dislike for drawing and writing also supports this assumption. However, since this is not definitive proof, I assigned a high but not absolute probability.
