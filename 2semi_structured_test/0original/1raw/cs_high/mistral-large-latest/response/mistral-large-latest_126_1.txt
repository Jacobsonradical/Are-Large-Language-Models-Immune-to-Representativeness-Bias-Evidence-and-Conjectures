{"probability": "0.85"}

The description suggests that Jason has a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. His lack of interest in drawing and writing also aligns more with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, it's important to note that this is a probability based on stereotypical traits and interests, and there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests.
