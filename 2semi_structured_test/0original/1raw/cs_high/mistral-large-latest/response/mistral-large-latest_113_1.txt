{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his lack of interest in drawing or writing further supports this assumption. However, it is important to note that this is still a probability and not a certainty, as there could be humanities professors with similar interests.
