{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the description, Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. His interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles align more closely with the computer science field. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with the humanities. However, since this is a probability-based question, I cannot say with absolute certainty that Jason is a computer science professor, hence the probability of 0.85.
