Explanation: Based on the information provided in the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles seem to align more closely with the field of computer science. While it is not impossible for a humanities professor to have these interests, it seems more likely that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. Additionally, the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are skills often associated with the humanities, further supports this conclusion. However, it is important to note that this is just an educated guess based on limited information, and there may be other factors at play that are not mentioned in the description.
