{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason appears to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are skills commonly associated with computer science professors. His lack of interest in drawing or writing also supports this assumption. Additionally, the description mentions that he is talented and ambitious, which are traits that could be beneficial in both computer science and humanities, but the specific interests mentioned lean more towards computer science. However, it is important to note that this is a probability and not a certainty, as personality traits alone do not determine a person's field of expertise.
