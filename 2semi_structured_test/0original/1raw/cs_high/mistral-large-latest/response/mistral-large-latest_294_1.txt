{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities commonly associated with computer science. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be more common among humanities professors. Therefore, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. However, this is not a certainty, as there is still a chance that Jason could be a humanities professor who enjoys coding and math as hobbies. Therefore, I assigned a probability of 0.85 to Jason being a computer science professor.
