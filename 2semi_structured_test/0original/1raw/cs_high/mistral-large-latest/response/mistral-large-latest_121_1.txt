{"probability": "0.85"}

The description of Jason's personality and interests suggests a higher probability of him being a computer science professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of interest in drawing or writing, aligns more closely with the typical interests and skills of a computer science professor. However, it is important to note that there is still a small chance that Jason could be a humanities professor with unique interests and hobbies, hence the probability is not 1.
