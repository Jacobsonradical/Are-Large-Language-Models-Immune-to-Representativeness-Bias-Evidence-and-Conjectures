{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation:
Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are common traits among humanities professors. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor to be 0.85. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the limited information provided and there may be other factors not mentioned that could influence the probability.
