{"probability": "0.85"}

Explanation: Based on the description, Jason seems to have a strong interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors. Additionally, despite being highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might suggest he is less likely to be a humanities professor. Therefore, I estimate that there is an 85% chance that Jason is a computer science professor.
