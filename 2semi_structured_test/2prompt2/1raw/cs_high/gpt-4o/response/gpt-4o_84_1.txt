To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason's description fitting his profile.

First, we need to determine the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors. So:
  \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(A^c) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors. So:
  \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate how likely Jason's description is if he is a computer science professor and if he is a humanities professor.

- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. The description indicates interests and traits that fit more typically with computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). We can interpret these interests as having a high probability. Let’s assume:
  \[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \]

- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. The description does not align well with typical humanities interests (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), so this probability would be lower. Let’s assume:
  \[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \]

Now we can use these estimates in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of Jason's description appearing, which can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Now, we plug this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, based on the description given, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643. 

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
