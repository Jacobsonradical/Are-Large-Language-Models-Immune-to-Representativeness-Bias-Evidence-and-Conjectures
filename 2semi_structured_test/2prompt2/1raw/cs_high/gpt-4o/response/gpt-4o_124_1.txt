To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we start with the given base rates and apply Bayesian reasoning, leveraging the provided description.

### Base Rates
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Hence, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is:
  \[
  P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

### Likelihood
Next, we assess how likely this personality description is given that Jason is either a computer science or a humanities professor. The description contains attributes such as enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with computer science than humanities.

- **Likelihood of Description for CS Professors, \( P(D|CS) \)**: We assume this is high due to Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles.
- **Likelihood of Description for Humanities Professors, \( P(D|Hum) \)**: We assume this is low because those attributes are generally less associated with humanities professors.

Suppose we estimate (somewhat subjectively, given the nature of the description):
\[
P(D|CS) = 0.9
\]
\[
P(D|Hum) = 0.1
\]

### Posterior Probability
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
We need to find \( P(D) \), which is the overall probability of the description given any professor:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.96
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.96"}
\]
