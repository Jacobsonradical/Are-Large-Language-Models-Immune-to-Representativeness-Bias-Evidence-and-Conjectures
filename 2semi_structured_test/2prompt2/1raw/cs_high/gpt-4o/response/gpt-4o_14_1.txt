To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(CS) \) and \( P(Hum) \))**:
    - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
    - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood (\( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \))**:
    - Jason's interests and traits are strongly associated with computer science (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles).
    - We can assume \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than \( P(D|Hum) \) because these traits are more common in computer science.

    Let's hypothesize:
    - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability, very likely description for a CS professor)
    - \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability, less likely description for a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
    \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
    \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
    \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
    \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

    Finally, 
    \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
    \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
    \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
    \[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
\[ {"probability": "0.964"} \]
