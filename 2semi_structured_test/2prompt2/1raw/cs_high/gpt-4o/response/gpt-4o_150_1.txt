To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

**Step 1: Find \( P(A) \)**

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor (before considering the description) is the proportion of CS professors in the sample.

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**Step 2: Find \( P(B|A) \)**

We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a CS professor. Given that Jason has a description fitting computer science traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), this probability should be relatively high. For simplicity, we will assume a high likelihood value:

\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]

**Step 3: Find \( P(B|\neg A) \)**

We now need to find the likelihood of Jason's description if he is not a computer science professor (i.e., a humanities professor). Given Jason's lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are more typical in humanities, and his enjoyment of coding and solving puzzles, this probability should be relatively low. We assume it to be a moderate-low likelihood:

\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.3 \]

**Step 4: Find \( P(B) \)**

This is the total probability of Jason's description across all professors, and can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.3 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.75 \]

**Step 5: Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Now, combine these values to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.75)}{0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.9.
