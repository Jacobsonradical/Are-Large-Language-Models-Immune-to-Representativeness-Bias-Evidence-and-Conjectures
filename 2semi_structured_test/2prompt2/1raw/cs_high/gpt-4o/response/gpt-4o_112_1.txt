Given the description provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) occurring given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \) occurring.

Given the information:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). The description indicates that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and although he is highly creative, he does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits are more strongly associated with computer science than humanities.

Let's assume that based on this description:
- \( P(D | CS) \) (probability that a computer science professor has this description) is high, say 0.8.
- \( P(D | H) \) (probability that a humanities professor has this description) is low, say 0.1.

Now we calculate \( P(D) \) which is the total probability of the description \( D \). Using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.8 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 * 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.96 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96.
