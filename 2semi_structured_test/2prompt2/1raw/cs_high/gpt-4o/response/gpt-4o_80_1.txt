To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches the profile provided.

Hereâ€™s how we'll break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[ P(H)=\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   This is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor. The description fits well with a computer science profile (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), so we assume a high likelihood. Let's denote this as \( P(B|CS) \).
   For the sake of quantifying, we might assume a high likelihood value, say \( 0.8 \) (or 80%).

   Given less information about humanities professors fitting this description, we might assign a smaller likelihood, say \( 0.2 \).

   Thus:
   \[ P(B|CS) = 0.8 \]
   \[ P(B|H) = 0.2 \]

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \):**
   The total probability of getting the description \( B \) regardless of the professor's field of expertise.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
   \[ = 0.65 \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   Substitute the values into Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is about 0.923, or approximately 92.3%.
