To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), where \( \neg A \) denotes not a computer science professor, i.e., a humanities professor. 

Given Jason's traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, but does not enjoy drawing or writing), it's more likely he is a computer science professor. However, we need numerical estimates to proceed.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS professor}) = 0.9 \) (since the description fits the profile of a computer science professor well)
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities professor}) = 0.2 \) (since it fits less well for a humanities professor)

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{description}) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability is:
