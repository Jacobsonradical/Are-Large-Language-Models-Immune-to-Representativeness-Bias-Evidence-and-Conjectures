To approach this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- The prior probability \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors).
- The prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors).

We want to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description for any professor.

To find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description, Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, he seems to match the profile of a computer science professor more closely. We can intuitively assign probabilities:
- \( P(D \mid C) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood of the description given he is a computer science professor).
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood of the description given he is a humanities professor).

Now we can compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.70 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.70} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
