To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Define the problem in terms of probabilities:**

   - Let \( P(CS) \) be the probability that the professor is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(Hum) \) be the probability that the professor is a humanities professor.
   - Let \( P(D | CS) \) be the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
   - Let \( P(D | Hum) \) be the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

2. **Assign prior probabilities based on the sample:**

   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Estimate the likelihoods:**

   Jason's description includes interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of computer science professors. While we don't have exact likelihoods, we can reasonably assume that:
   
   - \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high (let's approximate it as 0.9).
   - \( P(D | Hum) \) is relatively low because his interests are uncommon in the humanities (let's approximate it as 0.2).

4. **Apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
   \]

5. **Plug in the values:**

   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25}
              = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05}
              = \frac{0.675}{0.725}
              \approx 0.9310
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9310.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.931"}
