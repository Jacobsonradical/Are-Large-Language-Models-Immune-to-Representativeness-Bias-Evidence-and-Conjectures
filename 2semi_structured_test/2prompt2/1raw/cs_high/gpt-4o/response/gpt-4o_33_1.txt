Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our belief about the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Here's the breakdown of how we will do this:

1. **Prior Probability**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. In the sample:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(D | CS) \) and given that he is a humanities professor \( P(D | HU) \). Jason’s interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing/writing) are more stereotypically aligned with computer science. We can assume \( P(D | CS) > P(D | HU) \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood (Normalization constant)**: This is the total probability of observing the description across all professors, which includes both computer science and humanities professors.

   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HU) \cdot P(HU)
   \]

Given the qualitative nature of the question, we will use a likelihood ratio to reflect our judgment based on the given interests and traits. Let’s assume:

- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | HU) = 0.2 \)

These values reflect the assumption that the description is much more likely if Jason is a computer science professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Now, compute the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.923.

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.923"\}
\]
