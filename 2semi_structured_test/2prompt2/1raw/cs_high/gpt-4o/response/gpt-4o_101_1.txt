To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) be the given description of Jason.

We want to calculate \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

First, we need to calculate \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\):
- The description of Jason includes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more stereotypically aligned with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more aligned with the humanities.

Given these observations, let's assume:
- \(P(D|C)\) is high, say 0.9 (since his hobbies and traits fit well with a computer science professor).
- \(P(D|H)\) is lower, say 0.1 (since his hobbies and traits fit less well with a humanities professor).

Finally, we need to calculate \(P(D)\):
\[P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)\]
\[P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025\]
\[P(D) = 0.7\]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}\]
\[P(C|D) \approx 0.9643\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
