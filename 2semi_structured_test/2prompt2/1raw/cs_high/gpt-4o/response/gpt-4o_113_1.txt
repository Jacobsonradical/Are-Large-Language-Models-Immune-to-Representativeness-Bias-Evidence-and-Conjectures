To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) be the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's set the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description suggests certain traits like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which might be more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

Given the information:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is likely very high due to the traits aligning with typical characteristics of computer science professors.
- \( P(D|H) \) is likely lower due to the traits being less typical of humanities professors.

For the sake of calculation, let's assume some reasonable values (these will be rough estimates since exact probabilities are not provided):
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
