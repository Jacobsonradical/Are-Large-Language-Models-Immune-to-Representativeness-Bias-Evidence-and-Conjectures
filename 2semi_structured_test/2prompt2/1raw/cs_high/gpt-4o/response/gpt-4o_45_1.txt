To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D | \text{H}) \). Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, along with other traits, seems more aligned with a typical computer science professor than with a humanities professor. To quantify this, let's make some reasonable assumptions (though these are subjective).

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | \text{H}) = 0.2 \)

Now, we can find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} | D) \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.

So, the answer would be:
```json
{"probability": "0.931"}
