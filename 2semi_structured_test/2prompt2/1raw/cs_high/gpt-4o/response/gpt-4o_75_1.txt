Let's apply Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, we establish the following:

1. \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|Hum) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description mentions behaviors and interests typically associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), which might lead us to believe \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively high and \( P(D|Hum) \) as comparatively lower.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (very likely given Jason's interests).
- \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \) (less likely given the typical divergence in interests).

We use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
