Assuming we apply Bayesian reasoning to this problem, let's define the prior probabilities and the likelihood:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor: P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor: P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The given description highlights Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are highly indicative of activities a computer science professor might be more inclined towards. Letâ€™s denote this evidence as E.

We need to determine \( P(\text{CS}|E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the evidence E.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

We assume \( P(E|\text{CS}) \gg P(E|\text{H}) \) because coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strong indicators for computer science. Let's estimate these probabilities roughly:

- \( P(E|\text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(E|\text{H}) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, which can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(E) \approx (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) \approx 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, we can compute:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) \approx 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
