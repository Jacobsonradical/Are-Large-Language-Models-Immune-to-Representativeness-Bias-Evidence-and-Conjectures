To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event \( C \) as Jason being a computer science professor and \( H \) as Jason being a humanities professor.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\( n_C \)) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (\( n_H \)) = 25

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

To find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities more commonly associated with a computer science professor. Also, traits like being conservative, careful, and talented might be distributed similarly among both groups but his hobbies leading more towards CS.

It's reasonable to assume:
- \( P(D | C) \approx 0.80 \) (since his interests and traits align well with computer science professors)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.20 \) (less likely to enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles in humanities)

So,
\[ P(D) = 0.80 \cdot 0.75 + 0.20 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.60 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.60}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.923 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.923"} \]
