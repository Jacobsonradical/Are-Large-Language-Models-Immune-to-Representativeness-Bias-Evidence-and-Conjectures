To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the problem:

- We have two groups: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's description suggests characteristics that might be more common among computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.).

Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason having his description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason having his description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**:
   - There are 100 professors in total.
   - 75 of them are computer science professors.
   \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Complement Prior Probability (\( P(\neg A) \))**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**:
   - Since Jason's description is more typical of a computer science professor, let's assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high. For the sake of argument, let's assign \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

4. **Complement Likelihood (\( P(B|\neg A) \))**:
   - Jason's description is less typical of a humanities professor. We can assume itâ€™s lower. Let's assign \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

5. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \)) using Law of Total Probability**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

6. **Posterior Probability (\( P(A|B) \))**:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
