To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Since there is equal weight to both groups, we should also consider the base rates (proportion of each group within the total).

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total professors: 100

Base rates:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need the likelihoods that a description like Jason's would belong to either group. Assume for now we don't have explicit likelihood functions but rely on our intuition based on the description:

Jason's characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging; dislikes drawing or writing) align more closely with common stereotypes of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:
\[ P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

Since finding \( P(\text{Jason's description}) \) is complex without more data, we will simplify the comparison by assuming that Jason's description is significantly more likely to come from a CS professor. Let's assume the likelihood termed \( P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \) is higher relative to \( P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \).

Because Jason's description strongly fits a computer science professor and they make up a large majority (75%), we can assume a high probability considering these assumptions.

So, our posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be approximated at a high value close to the base rate. Given the assumptions, let's propose:

{"probability": "0.95"}
