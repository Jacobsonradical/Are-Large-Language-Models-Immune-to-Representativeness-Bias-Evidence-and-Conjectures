To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)):
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability that a professor is from humanities (\( P(H) \)):
     \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihoods of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).
     - Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science than humanities, we'll assume:
       \[ P(D|CS) \] is high
     - Given Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities potentially more common in the humanities, we'll assume:
       \[ P(D|H) \] is lower
   - Letâ€™s estimate these likelihoods intuitively. Assume:
     \[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
     \[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
   - Bayes' Theorem formula:
     \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   - Total probability of the description (\( P(D) \)):
     \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
     \[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
     \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
     \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

   - Posterior probability for computer science:
     \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
     \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
     \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]
     \[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
