To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayesian reasoning. 

Here are the relevant details:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to find the likelihood of the personality description given that he is a computer science professor and humanities professor, respectively.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the provided description of Jason.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \):
- \( P(D \mid C) \): probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, prominent traits indicative of computer science professors include enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. The description also states that Jason is not into drawing or writing, which aligns less with typical activities of humanities professors, implying \( P(D \mid C) \) is higher than \( P(D \mid H) \).

Let's assume a reasonable distinction:
- Let \( P(D \mid C) = 0.9 \)
- Let \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \)

Now, we calculate the total probability of the description \( P(D) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
