To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We need to find the following probabilities:
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):** The base rate probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):** The probability of observing Jason's description if Jason is a computer science professor.
3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(B) \):** The total probability of observing Jason's description under any case.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Prior Probability of being a Humanities Professor, \( P(A') \):**
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):**
   - The description of Jason fits more with a computer science professor's traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles).
   - We assume a higher likelihood, say \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \):**
   - The description does not fit as well with humanities professors.
   - We assume a lower likelihood, say \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \).

5. **Marginal Probability, \( P(B) \):**
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.725 \)

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.931"}
