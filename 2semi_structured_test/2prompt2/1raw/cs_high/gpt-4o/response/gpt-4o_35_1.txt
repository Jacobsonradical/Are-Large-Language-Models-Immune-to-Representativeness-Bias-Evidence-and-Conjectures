To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the given description.

First, let's define the elements:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \) (the event that Jason is a humanities professor): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given the description, it appears strongly aligned with typical traits associated with computer science professors, such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles. For argument's sake, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description does not particularly align with typical humanities interests, let's assume:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of getting the description \( B \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, let's apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
