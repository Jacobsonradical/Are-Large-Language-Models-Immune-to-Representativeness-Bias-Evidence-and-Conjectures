To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): the description given for Jason.

Firstly, the prior probabilities can be computed based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we'll need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description given Jason is a computer science or humanities professor.

From the description, we can infer that Jason's attributes (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing) suggest a stronger resemblance to a typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \) is significantly higher, say 0.8.
- \( P(D|H) \) is significantly lower, say 0.1.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.96 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.96"}
