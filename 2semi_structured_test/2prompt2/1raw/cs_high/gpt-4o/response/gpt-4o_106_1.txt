Given Jason's description, we need to update our prior probability to obtain the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor. Let's proceed by evaluating the relevant factors.

First, consider the base rates given by the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of Jason's described traits given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Jason's traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly indicative of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. In contrast, humanities professors are more likely to enjoy drawing or writing, which Jason does not.

Let:
- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.9 \) (high probability given the traits fit well with computer science)
- \( P(\text{Description} | Hum) = 0.1 \) (low probability given the mismatch with typical humanities traits)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where the total probability of the description \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be obtained by the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Substituting this back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
