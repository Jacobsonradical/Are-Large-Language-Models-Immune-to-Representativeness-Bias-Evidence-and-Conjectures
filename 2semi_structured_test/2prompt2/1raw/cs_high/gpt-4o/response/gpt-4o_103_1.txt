To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is defined as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For our problem:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence described about Jason.

We need to find \( P(\text{CS|Description}) \). 

First, let's define:
- \( P(B|CS) \) as the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(B|Humanities) \) as the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Humanities) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- 75 are computer science professors and 25 are humanities professors.

Thus:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason aligns more with traits commonly found in computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not interested in drawing or writing), we might subjectively estimate:
- \( P(B|CS) = 0.9 \) (high probability since the description fits a common stereotype of a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|Humanities) = 0.1 \) (low probability since the description does not fit as well a humanities professor)

Now compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643 (rounded to four decimal places).
