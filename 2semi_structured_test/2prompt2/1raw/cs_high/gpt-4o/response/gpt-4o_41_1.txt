Given the description of Jason, we need to calculate the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor using Bayes' Theorem.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor \(\mathbb{P}(\text{CS})\): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor \(\mathbb{P}(\text{H})\): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{H})\): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities highly associated with computer science, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more aligned with humanities, it is likely that:

- \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\) will be relatively high.
- \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{H})\) will be relatively low.

Since no exact likelihood values are provided, let's make a reasonable assumption based on the given description. Assume:

- \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9\) (high likelihood given his CS-related interests)
- \(\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.1\) (low likelihood given his disinterest in humanities-related activities)

3. **Normalizing Constant:**
   \[
   \mathbb{P}(\text{Description}) = \mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\mathbb{P}(\text{CS}) + \mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{H})\mathbb{P}(\text{H})
   \]

   \[
   \mathbb{P}(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   \[
   \mathbb{P}(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{CS})}{\mathbb{P}(\text{Description})}
   \]

   \[
   \mathbb{P}(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
