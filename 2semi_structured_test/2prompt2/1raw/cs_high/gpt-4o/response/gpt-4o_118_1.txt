To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we are looking to find \( P(CS \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(CS) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science. With 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, this is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities. This is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   \[
   P(D \mid CS): \text{The probability of the description given that the professor is a computer scientist.}
   \]
   \[
   P(D \mid H): \text{The probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.}
   \]

Given the traits described, Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more typically associated with computer science. While the exact probabilities (likelihoods) \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) aren't strictly defined, we can reasonably assume \( P(D \mid CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D \mid H) \).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since we established \( P(D \mid CS) \) is much higher than \( P(D \mid H) \), we can work with relative probabilities.

Let's assume a reasonable example for illustration, where \( P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.8 \) and \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.2 \).

Then,

\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.923"}
