Given the description provided, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to estimate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

First, let's adjust the information into Bayesian terms:

- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(Hum)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|Hum)\) is the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are given by the proportion of each group in the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \(P(D|Hum)\) is the likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description.

The description includes several clues that might be more typical of a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (indicative of computer science).
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing (more indicative of less interest in typical humanities activities).

Let's assume the following for the sake of the calculation:
- The likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) is quite high because the characteristics fit a computer science professor well, say, \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\).
- The likelihood \(P(D|Hum)\) is quite low because the characteristics fit a humanities professor less well, say, \(P(D|Hum) = 0.1\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
