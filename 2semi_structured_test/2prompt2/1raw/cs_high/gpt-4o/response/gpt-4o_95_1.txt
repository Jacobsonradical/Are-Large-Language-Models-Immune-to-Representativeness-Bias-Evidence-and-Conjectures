To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability of being a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability of being a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) = probability of the description if the professor is in computer science
- \( P(D|H) \) = probability of the description if the professor is in the humanities
- \( P(D) \) = overall probability of the description

We start by noting the priors:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider how the description fits each category. Jason seems to have characteristics more commonly aligned with a computer science professor (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles), although he does not enjoy activities like drawing or writing that might be more typical for a humanities professor. 

Given this qualitative assessment, let’s assume that:

- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively high because the description strongly fits a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low because the description weakly fits a humanities professor

Since we don’t have exact numerical values, but assuming a strong fit for \( P(D|CS) \) and weak for \( P(D|H) \), let us hypothetically assume:

- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we compute the posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.923.
