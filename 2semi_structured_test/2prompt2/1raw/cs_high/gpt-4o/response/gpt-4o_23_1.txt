To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the following:

1. Prior probability: This is the initial probability before any evidence is taken into account.
   - The probability \(P(CS)\) that a professor is from computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability \(P(H)\) that a professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. Likelihood: This is the probability of the given description occurring within each group.
   - We denote \(P(D|CS)\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
   - We denote \(P(D|H)\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.
   
Given the details in the description (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.), it seems more likely that Jason is from computer science rather than humanities. If we make a reasonable assumption:
   - \(P(D|CS)\) could be, say, 0.9 (very high, given the fit to typical traits of CS professors).
   - \(P(D|H)\) could be, say, 0.1 (low, given the mismatch with typical traits of humanities professors).

Bayes' Theorem formula for the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\) is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = \frac{27}{28} \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ \mathbf{ {"probability": "0.9643"} } \]
