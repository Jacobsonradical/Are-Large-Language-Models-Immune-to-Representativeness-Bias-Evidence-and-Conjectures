To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of how we'll approach this problem:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to assess how likely it is that someone with Jason's description would be a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests and traits:
   - Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
   - Highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These traits heavily align more with a computer science professor based on typical stereotypes and profiles (e.g., interest in coding and mathematical puzzles).

Let's denote:
   - P(D|CS) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
   - P(D|H) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given the description, P(D|CS) is likely higher than P(D|H). Although we lack exact values, we can assume:
   - P(D|CS) is something close to a high value, like 0.9.
   - P(D|H) is something lower, like 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \).

Now plugging in the values:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

So:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9643. \]

Therefore, the posterior probability is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
