To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let:
- \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are looking for \(P(C \mid E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(E\).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E \mid C)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To complete Bayes' theorem, we need \(P(E \mid C)\) and \(P(E \mid H)\):

### Estimating Likelihoods
Considering Jason's traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creativity) are highly aligned with computer science:

- \(P(E \mid C)\) is likely high.
- \(P(E \mid H)\) is likely much lower, given that solving mathematical puzzles and coding are less common in the humanities.

Let's assume \(P(E \mid C) = 0.9\) (high likelihood for computer science).
Let's assume \(P(E \mid H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood for humanities).

### Total Probability \(P(E)\)
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
