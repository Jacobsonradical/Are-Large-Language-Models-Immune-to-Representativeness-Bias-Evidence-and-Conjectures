To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(A^c) \):
- \( P(A) \) = probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A^c) \) = probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), which are the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

The description indicates Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits are more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Let's assign reasonable estimates based on the description:
- \( P(B|A) \) = a high probability, say 0.9, given the alignment with computer science traits.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = a lower probability, say 0.2, given the misalignment with typical humanities traits.

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
