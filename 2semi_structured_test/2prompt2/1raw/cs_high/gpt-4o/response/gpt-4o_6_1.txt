To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

We start by calculating the prior probabilities:
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of observing Jason's description given each category. To simplify, let's consider qualitative aspects of the description:

Key traits:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing

Given these traits, it is more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Since the description aligns more closely with typical attributes of a computer science professor, we'll assume the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given the description is higher than being a humanities professor.

Let:
- Likelihood of Jason's description given computer science professor (P(D|CS)) = 0.9 (assumed but adaptable based on more refined data)
- Likelihood of Jason's description given humanities professor (P(D|H)) = 0.1 (assumed but adaptable)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS|D)):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
