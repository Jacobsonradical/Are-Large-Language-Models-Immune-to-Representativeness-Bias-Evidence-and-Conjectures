To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A, which in this case is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A, which in this case is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of B, which in this case is the overall probability of the description considering both computer science and humanities professors.

We can start by determining the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \):
- The description of Jason (`conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing`) seems to align more with a typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
- If we assign a higher likelihood to the description appearing for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor, letâ€™s say \( P(B|CS) = 0.95 \) and \( P(B|H) = 0.05 \).

Finally, we calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.95 \cdot 0.75) + (0.05 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7125 + 0.0125 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.7125}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.9828 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9828.
