To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- A description of Jason, who seems to have interests and traits that might be more strongly associated with a computer science professor (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description, given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of Jason's description, given that he is a humanities professor.

Starting with the priors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to estimate the likelihoods, \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description of Jason, it seems reasonable to assume that the probability of such traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing) is higher among computer science professors than humanities professors.

Let's assign a likelihood ratio based on the given description. Assume that the probability of a computer science professor having Jason's description is higher compared to a humanities professor. For illustrative purposes, let's use:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description appearing in the sample:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

The final answer is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.9643"\} \]
