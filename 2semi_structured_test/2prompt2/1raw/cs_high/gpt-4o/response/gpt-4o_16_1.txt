Given the information provided, let's apply Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

First, we calculate:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We next evaluate the likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):
- \( P(D|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Considering Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(D|A) \): Likely high, say 0.9.
- \( P(D|B) \): Likely low, say 0.2.

Now substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|D) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.
