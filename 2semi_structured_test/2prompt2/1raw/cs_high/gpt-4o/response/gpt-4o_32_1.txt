To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, we need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event of receiving Jason's description.

We want to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We are given that:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, let’s assume that the description matches closely with traits that are more common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors, given his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. So, we will assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \), the probability of receiving Jason's description if he is a computer science professor, is higher, for example, let’s assume it to be 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability of receiving Jason's description if he is a humanities professor, is lower, let’s assume it to be 0.1.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.

Here is the answer in the required format:
