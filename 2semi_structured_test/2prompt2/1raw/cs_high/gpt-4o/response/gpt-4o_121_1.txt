To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, consider the base rates of the two groups:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

So, the prior probabilities are:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the given description fitting a professor in each group. Let’s denote:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Being conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, and not enjoying drawing or writing also support this. While exact probabilities for \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are not given, we can reasonably assume \( P(D \mid CS) \) is higher than \( P(D \mid H) \).

For simplicity, let’s use reasonable estimations:
- Let’s assume \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.9 \)
- Let’s assume \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \)

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \times P(H)}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = 0.964
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
