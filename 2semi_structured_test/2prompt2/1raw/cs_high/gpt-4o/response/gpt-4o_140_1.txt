To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's lay out the relevant information first:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description suggests characteristics and activities more commonly associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities (drawing or writing).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

To calculate \( P(B) \), we need:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

For the probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Without specific data on these probabilities, we assume:
- The description is highly likely (let's say 0.9) if Jason is a computer science professor.
- The description is less likely (let's say 0.1) if Jason is a humanities professor.

So:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

Now calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, plug these values into Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
