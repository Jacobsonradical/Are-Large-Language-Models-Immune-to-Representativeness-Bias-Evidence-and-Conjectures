To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we will employ Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving Jason's description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- Let \( P(CS) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- Let \( P(H) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Hence:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods, which represent the probability of receiving Jason's description given the professor's field:
- Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description matching a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description matching a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests and traits (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assume that he is more likely to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For the sake of argument, let's assign:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \] (High probability given the match with typical computer science interests)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \] (Low probability considering the distinct mismatch with typical humanities interests)

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description across both groups:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \approx 0.96 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96.
