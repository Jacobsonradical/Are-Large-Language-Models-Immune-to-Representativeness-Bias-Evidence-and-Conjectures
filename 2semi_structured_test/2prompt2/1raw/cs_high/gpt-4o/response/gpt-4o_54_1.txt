To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Descriptions were written for each professor.

We want to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \].
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \].
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Considering Jason's characteristics: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, these are more aligned with the typical interests found in computer science compared to the humanities.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (highly likely given Jason's characteristics)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (less likely given Jason's characteristics)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{(0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\{"probability": "0.964"\}
