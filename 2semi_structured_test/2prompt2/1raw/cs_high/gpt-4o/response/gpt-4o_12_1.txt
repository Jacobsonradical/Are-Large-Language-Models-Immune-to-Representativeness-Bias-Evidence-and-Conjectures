To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll employ Bayes' Theorem. Here, Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on the evidence presented.

Let's define the variables:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \): Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

From the problem, we have:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description of Jason indicates a strong alignment with interests and traits typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles), and less so with a humanities professor. Hence, for simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.90 \): High likelihood that Jason fits the description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) = 0.10 \): Low likelihood that Jason fits the description if he is a humanities professor.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{0.90 \cdot 0.75 + 0.10 \cdot 0.25}
\]
Compute the denominator:
\[
0.90 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675
\]
\[
0.10 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025
\]
\[
0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70
\]

Now compute the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
