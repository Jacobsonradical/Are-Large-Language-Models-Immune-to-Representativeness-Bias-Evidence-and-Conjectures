To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- Total number of professors = 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- We need the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break it down:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
Since attributes like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging are more aligned with the interests and activities of computer science professors, we'll reasonably assume a high probability, say 0.9.

3. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
We can assume a lower probability because the description is less typical for humanities professors. Letâ€™s estimate it at 0.2.

4. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.931.

The answer is:

{"probability": "0.931"}
