To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

In this context:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of observing the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of observing the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing the given description.

Firstly, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, specific traits (such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are more likely to be associated with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We can make reasonable assumptions about the likelihood:

Let's assume the likelihoods:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Hence, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
