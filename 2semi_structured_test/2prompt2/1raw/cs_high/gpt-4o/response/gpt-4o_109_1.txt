Given the information, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the additional details about Jason. The theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jason's description among all professors.

First, let's establish our priors:
- The probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given no other information is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. So,
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Therefore, the probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \):
- \( P(B | A) \): The probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor. Given his interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems likely he is a computer science professor. For estimation purposes, we'll assume this probability to be relatively high, e.g., 0.9.

- \( P(B | \neg A) \): The probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor. Given that his description strongly aligns with interests more common among computer science professors, this probability would be relatively low. We'll estimate it at, say, 0.1.

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of observing Jason's description. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.70 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.70} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
