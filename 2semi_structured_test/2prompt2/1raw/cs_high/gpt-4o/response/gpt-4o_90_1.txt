To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

First, let's identify and compute the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   - Similarly, there are 25 humanities professors out of the total.
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - This is the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing (both are more aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor), it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) is relatively high compared to \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \).
   - Let's assume a reasonable approximation to these likelihoods based on the description, assigning a hypothetical higher probability for traits aligning with a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - This is the marginal probability of the description \( B \). It can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**:
   - We now substitute into Bayesâ€™ theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
