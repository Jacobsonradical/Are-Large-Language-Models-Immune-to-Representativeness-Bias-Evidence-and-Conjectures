To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we estimate \( P(B|C) \) and \( P(B|H) \). Given Jason's interests and traits, he sounds more like a computer science professor than a humanities professor, as he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common in computer science. For this reason, we assume \( P(B|C) \) is higher than \( P(B|H) \).

While exact values would typically require empirical data or expert assessment, we will make reasonable assumptions:
\[ P(B|C) \approx 0.9 \]  (high likelihood given Jason's interests)
\[ P(B|H) \approx 0.1 \]  (low likelihood given Jason's interests)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{P(B|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

The answer in the specified format is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
