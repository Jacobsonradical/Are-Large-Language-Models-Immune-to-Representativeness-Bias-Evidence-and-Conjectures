To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- \( P(Hum) \) = Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Let \( D \) represent the given description.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly,
\[ P(Hum|D) = \frac{P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(D)} \]

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, it's reasonable to assume that such traits are more likely among computer science professors than humanities professors. Let's denote the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \).

For simplicity, assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood because Jason's traits strongly match computer science traits)
- \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood because Jason's traits do not strongly match humanities traits)

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
