To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and let \( B \) be the given description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Given the nature of the description, we can reasonably estimate that the likelihood of the description \( P(B|A) \) being applicable to a computer science professor is higher than to a humanities professor. For the sake of the estimation, let's suppose:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.1 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.025 = 0.625 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.625} = \frac{0.6}{0.625} = 0.96 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.96"}
