To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem gives us a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given the total of 100 professors, with 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities:
- Prior probability \( P(CS) \) is 0.75 (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100).
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) is 0.25 (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100).

The description of Jason suggests that he enjoys activities like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seem more aligned with someone in computer science. However, we don't have the exact probabilities for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given the context of the description and assuming the likelihood of such traits is much higher in computer science professors than in humanities professors, we could estimate these likelihoods.

For simplicity, we'll assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is high, say 0.9.
- \( P(D | H) \) is low, say 0.1.

Now, we can use the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS)P(CS) + P(D | H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can plug in our values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

The final answer, formatted as requested, is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
