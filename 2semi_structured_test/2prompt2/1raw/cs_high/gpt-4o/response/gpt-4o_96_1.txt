To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let’s denote the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate each of the components:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \)**:
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability that the description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability that the description matches a humanities professor.

Jason's description indicates he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors.

So, let’s hypothetically say:
- \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high, for example, 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low, for example, 0.2.

3. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(D) \)**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Now substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.931.

So the answer should be in the format:
{"probability": "0.931"}
