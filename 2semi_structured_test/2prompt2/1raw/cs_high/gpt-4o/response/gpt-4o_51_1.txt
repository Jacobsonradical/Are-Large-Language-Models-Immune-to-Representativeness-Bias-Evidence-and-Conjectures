To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem is formally stated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Here are the provided data:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- The prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we have no specific prior information about the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can use the description itself to infer this information. The description of Jason seems to fit the stereotypical characteristics associated more closely with computer science professors (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) rather than humanities professors. Thus, we can reasonably assume:

  \[ P(D|CS) \gg P(D|H) \]

However, to illustrate the calculation, we will use common sense, suggesting that:
\[
P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \text{ (high likelihood)}
\]
\[
P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \text{ (low likelihood)}
\]

Now we calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
