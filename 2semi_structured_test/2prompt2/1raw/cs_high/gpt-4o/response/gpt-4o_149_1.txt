To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem formula is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given about Jason.

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

With the description indicating interests and traits more aligned with computer science, we will assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) > P(B|A_{H}) \).

For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood that Jason’s description matches a computer science professor) and \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood that Jason’s description matches a humanities professor). These probabilities are generally assumed for calculation considering the described traits and interests.

Now, calculating the normalizing constant \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.
