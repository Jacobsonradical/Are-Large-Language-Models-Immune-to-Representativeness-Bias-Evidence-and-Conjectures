To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we denote:

- \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The event that Jason is described as conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

We start with the prior probabilities:

- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is the proportion of computer science professors in the entire sample:

\[
P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

- \( P(A') \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is the proportion of humanities professors in the entire sample:

\[
P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the description, it seems highly probable that someone with a preference for coding and solving mathematical puzzles would be a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Let's assign some reasonable estimates based on these tendencies:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (high probability that a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.05 \) (low probability that a humanities professor fits this description)

Lastly, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A')
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.05 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.0125 = 0.6125
\]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.6125} = \frac{0.6}{0.6125} \approx 0.98
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.98"}
\]
