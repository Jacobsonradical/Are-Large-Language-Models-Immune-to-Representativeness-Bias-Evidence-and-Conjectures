To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description assuming Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we need to determine each of these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):** This is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):** This is the proportion of humanities professors in the total sample.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):** This is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly indicative of a computer science professor. We would assign a higher likelihood to this scenario; let's assume this probability to be relatively high. For illustration purposes, we'll assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):** This is the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor. Since it is less likely for a humanities professor to have such a strong inclination towards coding and mathematical puzzles, we might assign a lower likelihood to this scenario. We'll assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):** This is the overall probability of Jason's description considering both groups. It can be calculated by:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.
