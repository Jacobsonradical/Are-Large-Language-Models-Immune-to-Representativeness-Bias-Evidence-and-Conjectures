In assessing the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The base rates (prior probabilities) and likelihoods need to be taken into account.

**Given:**
- Base rate of computer science professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Base rate of humanities professors: \( P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Description highly suggests attributes more aligned with computer science (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging fits another non-technical hobby)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \)

Assuming that the likelihood of this description given computer science (CS) is very high, say \( P(\text{description}|CS) = 0.9 \), and the likelihood of this description given humanities (H) is quite low, say \( P(\text{description}|H) = 0.1 \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.96"}
