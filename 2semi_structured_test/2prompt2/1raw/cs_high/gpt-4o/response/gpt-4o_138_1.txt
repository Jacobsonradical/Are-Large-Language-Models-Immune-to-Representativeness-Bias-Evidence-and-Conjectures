We will use Bayes' theorem to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

1. **Prior probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science (CS) professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Prior probability \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Based on Jason's characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and disinterest in drawing or writing), it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor.
   - Let's denote the likelihood of Jason being a CS professor given his description as \( P(Desc | CS) \).
   - And the likelihood of Jason being a humanities professor given his description as \( P(Desc | Hum) \).

   Without exact numerical values for the likelihoods, we can make an assumption based on the description:
   - It is reasonable to assume \( P(Desc | CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(Desc | Hum) \).

Let's assign some reasonable but presumed likelihoods:
- \( P(Desc | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(Desc | Hum) = 0.1 \)

3. **Evidence**:
   - The total probability of getting this description is given by:
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P(Desc) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

4. **Posterior probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.
