To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines prior probabilities with likelihoods to give us a posterior probability.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason as given.

Given from the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

From the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seems more typical for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Without exact likelihoods, we make a reasonable assumption that:

- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) as it fits the profile for a computer science professor.
- Let's assume \( P(B|H) = 0.1 \) as it does not fit well with the profile for a humanities professor.

Now, using the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.9643 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
