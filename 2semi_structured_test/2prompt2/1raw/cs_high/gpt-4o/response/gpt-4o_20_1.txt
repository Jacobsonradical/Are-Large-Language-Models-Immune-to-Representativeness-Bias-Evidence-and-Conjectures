To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Here’s how we can break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complement \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
   Given the interests and traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems much more typical of a computer science professor. Let's assume:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: Similarly, we approximate the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor. Given traits more typical of a computer science professor, let's assume:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]

5. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
