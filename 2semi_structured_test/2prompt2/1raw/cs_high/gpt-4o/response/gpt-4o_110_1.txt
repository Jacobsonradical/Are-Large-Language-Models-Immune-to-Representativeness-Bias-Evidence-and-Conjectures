Given the description of Jason, it seems reasonable to infer that he might be more likely to be a computer science professor based on his interests and traits. To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:

- \( C_{cs} \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( C_{hum} \) : Jason is a humanities professor.

From the study:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( N_{cs} = 75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( N_{hum} = 25 \)).

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C_{cs}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(C_{hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Let \( D \) represent Jason's description. We need to find \( P(C_{cs} | D) \).

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(C_{cs} | D) = \frac{P(D | C_{cs}) P(C_{cs})}{P(D)} \]

We assume that Jason's interests and traits make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. Specifically, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more aligned with typical traits of computer science professors. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that \( P(D | C_{cs}) \) is higher than \( P(D | C_{hum}) \).

Let's assign:
- \( P(D | C_{cs}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | C_{hum}) \approx 0.2 \)

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | C_{cs}) P(C_{cs}) + P(D | C_{hum}) P(C_{hum}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(C_{cs} | D) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.75)}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C_{cs} | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C_{cs} | D) \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.923"} \]
