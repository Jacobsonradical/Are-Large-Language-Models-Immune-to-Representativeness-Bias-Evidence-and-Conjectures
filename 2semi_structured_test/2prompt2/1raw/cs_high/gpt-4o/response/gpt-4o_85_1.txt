To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that someone chosen at random is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of Jason's description among all the professors.

From the study, we know that:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \(P(A)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We do not have precise numbers for \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B)\), but we can make subjective judgments based on the description provided:

The description of Jason aligns strongly with typical characteristics expected from a computer science professor: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and has a creative yet non-artistic inclination. While it is possible for humanities professors to have some of these traits, they are more likely in computer science.

Historically and culturally, the traits mentioned, especially coding and mathematical puzzles, are highly indicative of someone being in the computer science field. 

Because of this, we can reasonably assume that \(P(B|A)\) is high, and \(P(B|¬A)\) (the probability of this description given Jason is a humanities professor) is lower.

We can make an educated guess:
- \(P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \)
- \(P(B|¬A) \approx 0.2 \)

Then:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A)} \]

Substituting values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.93"}
