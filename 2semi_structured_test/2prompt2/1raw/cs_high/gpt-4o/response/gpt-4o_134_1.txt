To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
  
We know the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E \mid H_{H}) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (logical and technical hobbies) align more closely with typical profiles of computer science professors. Thus:
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) \) is likely to be higher.
- \( P(E \mid H_{H}) \) might be lower, given the general association of these activities with computer science rather than humanities.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(E \mid H_{H}) = 0.1 \)

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E \mid H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H})} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.964"}
