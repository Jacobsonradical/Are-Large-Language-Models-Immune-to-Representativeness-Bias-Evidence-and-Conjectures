To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the prior probabilities and then apply the likelihood based on the description.

Prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
- Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we need to consider the likelihood of the description given the profession. Assuming the description is more likely to fit a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we can denote these likelihoods as follows:
- \( P(description | CS) \)
- \( P(description | H) \)

Let's assume that the description is 0.8 likely to describe a CS professor and 0.2 likely to describe a humanities professor, as the traits and interests mentioned align more closely with typical characteristics of a CS professor.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor can be calculated as:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
