To compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of observing the description overall.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) = "Jason is a computer science professor"
- \( A' \) = "Jason is a humanities professor"
- \( B \) = "The description matches Jason's profile"

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
- \( P(A') \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25

We need to estimate:
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(B|A') \) = Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(B) \) = Overall probability of the description

Given Jason's interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, and lack of interest in drawing or writing, it seems more consistent with the typical profile of a computer science professor. Let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (high because the description matches a stereotypical computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.1 \) (low because the description does not match a stereotypical humanities professor)

Now, using the law of total probability for \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.964 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.964.
