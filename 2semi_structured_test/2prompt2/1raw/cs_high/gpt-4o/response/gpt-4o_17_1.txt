To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can calculate it step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): 75 out of 100.
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\( P(\text{Hum}) \)): 25 out of 100.

   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of the profile fitting a computer science professor, \( P(D|\text{CS}) \).
   - The likelihood of the profile fitting a humanities professor, \( P(D|\text{Hum}) \).

   Based on the description of Jason, we note his interests align more closely with typical computer science activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a technical mindset) than with humanities activities. Hence, we can reasonably assume that \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) is greater than \( P(D|\text{Hum}) \).

   For simplification (and lacking more detailed data), let's suppose:
   \[
   P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(D|\text{Hum}) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Normalizing Constant:**
   To find the probability of the data \( D \):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) * P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Hum}) * P(\text{Hum})
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.9 * 0.75 + 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   We use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(\text{CS}|D) \):
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) * P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.725} = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \approx 0.931
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.

Hence, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.931"}
