To calculate the posterior probability, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

First, let's list what we know:
- The number of computer science professors (\( N_C \)) is 75.
- The number of humanities professors (\( N_H \)) is 25.
- The total number of professors (\( N \)) is 100.

The prior probabilities are:
\[
P(C) = \frac{N_C}{N} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{N_H}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need to consider \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \).

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor due to his interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science than humanities. 

Letâ€™s assume:
\[
P(\text{description} \mid C) = 0.80
\]
\[
P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.20
\]

Then compute \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.75) + (0.20 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(\text{description}) = 0.60 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]
\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.75}{0.65}
\]
\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.60}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.923"}
\]
