To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided matches Jason's profile.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample: 
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(A^c) \)): 
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the description fits Jason given that he is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his dislike for drawing and writing, it is likely higher for a computer science professor. For estimation, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability that the description fits Jason given that he is a humanities professor. Given the interests described, it is less likely for a humanities professor. For estimation, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \]

Now, we calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
