To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is how we can approach it:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\( P(H) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods**: 
   We need to consider how likely it is that a professor with Jason's description would come from either discipline. Given the description, Jason seems to fit more neatly into the profile of a computer science professor:
   - Likelihood of being a computer science professor given Jason's description (\( P(D|CS) \)).
   - Likelihood of being a humanities professor given Jason's description (\( P(D|H) \)).

Given Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is reasonable to assume that these characteristics are more commonly found in computer science professors. However, we need numerical values for these likelihoods.

Assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood because of his interests)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood because of his interests)

3. **Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

4. Calculate \( P(D) \):
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

5. Apply Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = \frac{675}{700} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
