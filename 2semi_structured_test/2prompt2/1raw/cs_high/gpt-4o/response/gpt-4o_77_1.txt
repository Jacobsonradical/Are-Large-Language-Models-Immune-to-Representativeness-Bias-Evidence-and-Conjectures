To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason has the given description.

First, let's identify the required probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability (P(A)):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Complement Prior Probability (P(A')):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A)):**
   - Probability of having the described traits given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing, these traits are more aligned with computer science professors.
   - We can assume that it's highly likely for a CS professor to have Jason’s traits. Let's approximate it at 0.9.

4. **Likelihood (P(B|A')):**
   - Probability of having the described traits given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Jason's disinterest in drawing or writing is less typical for humanities professors, so this would be lower.
   - Let’s approximate it at 0.1.

5. **Normalization Constant (P(B)):**
   - Total probability of having the described traits.
   - This combines the two scenarios weighted by their prior probabilities.
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Traits}) = \frac{P(\text{Traits}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Traits})}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Traits}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
