To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \(P(C | E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \(E\) (the description of Jason). According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | E) = \frac{P(E | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E | C)\) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods \(P(E | C)\) and \(P(E | H)\). Based on the description provided for Jason (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging; does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more consistent with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We can assign subjective probabilities to these likelihoods. Letâ€™s assume a high likelihood for computer science (e.g., 0.9) and a lower likelihood for humanities (e.g., 0.1).

\[ P(E | C) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(E | H) = 0.1 \]

Now, we can compute \(P(E)\), the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E | C) \cdot P(C) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability \(P(C | E)\):

\[ P(C | E) = \frac{P(E | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | E) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
