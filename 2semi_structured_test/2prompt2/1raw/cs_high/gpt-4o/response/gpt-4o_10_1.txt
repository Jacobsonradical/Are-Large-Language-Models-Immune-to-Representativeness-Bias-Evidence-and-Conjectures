First, let's outline the baselines and likelihoods to apply Bayes' theorem effectively:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability a randomly chosen professor is in Computer Science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability a randomly chosen professor is in the Humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Given Jason's traits, let's assess how typical these are for a CS professor versus a Humanities professor:
     - Enjoying coding: Likely higher probability for CS.
     - Solving mathematical puzzles: Likely higher for CS.
     - Jogging: This is neutral and doesnâ€™t significantly favor one group over the other.
     - Ambitious, talented, conservative, and careful: These traits could be common in both groups.
     - Highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing: Likely higher for CS.

Given these factors, we estimate the likelihood ratios:

- \( P(\text{traits} \mid CS) \): High (represented as let's say \( k_{CS} \))
- \( P(\text{traits} \mid H) \): Low (represented as let's say \( k_{H} \))

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{traits}) = \frac{P(\text{traits} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{traits} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{traits} \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given that \( P(\text{traits} \mid CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(\text{traits} \mid H) \) (since the traits listed align closely with typical CS activities and interests), we can approximate \( \frac{k_{CS}}{k_{H}} \) to demonstrate a higher posterior probability for Jason being a CS professor.

Assuming \( P(\text{traits} \mid CS) \approx 0.90 \) and \( P(\text{traits} \mid H) \approx 0.10 \) (since the interests align more closely with CS activities), Bayes' theorem simplifies as follows:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{traits}) \approx \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{0.90 \cdot 0.75 + 0.10 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS \mid \text{traits}) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(CS \mid \text{traits}) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.70} \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
