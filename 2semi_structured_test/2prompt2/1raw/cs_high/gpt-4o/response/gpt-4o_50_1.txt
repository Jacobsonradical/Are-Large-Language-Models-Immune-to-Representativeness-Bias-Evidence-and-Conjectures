To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should apply Bayes' Theorem. Given the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the evidence, we can calculate this as follows:

- Let \( P(A|B) \) be the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- Let \( P(A) \) be the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- Let \( P(B|A) \) be the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( P(B) \) be the overall probability of the description among all professors.

From the problem data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description fits a computer science professor better than a humanities professor, we can set our likelihoods accordingly:
- \( P(B|A) \) (description fits a computer science professor well): high likelihood.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (description fits a humanities professor poorly): low likelihood.

For example, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (since Jason's activities and personality traits align with stereotypical computer science professors).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (since his traits don't align well with stereotypical humanities professors).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
