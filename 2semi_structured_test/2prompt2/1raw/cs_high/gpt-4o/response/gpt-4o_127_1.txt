To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, we need to establish prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given description:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \):
     \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(D \mid CS) \),
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(D \mid H) \).

Given Jason's description (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles, and jogging, among other characteristics), it seems that these traits are more aligned with a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Let's assume the following likelihoods based on our judgment:
   - \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.90 \)
   - \( P(D \mid H) = 0.10 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.75}{0.90 \cdot 0.75 + 0.10 \cdot 0.25} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.90 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.90 \cdot 0.75 + 0.10 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643, or 96.43%.

Answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
