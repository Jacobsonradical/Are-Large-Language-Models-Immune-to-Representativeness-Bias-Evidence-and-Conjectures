Given the provided description and the numbers in the study, we will use Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**

The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**

The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**

Jason's description includes interests that are more typical for a computer science professor: coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc. So, it is reasonable to assume a higher likelihood that a computer science professor would fit this description compared to a humanities professor. 
We can subjectively assign:
\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**

Conversely, the likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description is lower. We can subjectively assign:
\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) = 0.1 \]

Given these estimates, we can calculate the overall marginal probability \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.9643 \approx 0.96 \] 

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
