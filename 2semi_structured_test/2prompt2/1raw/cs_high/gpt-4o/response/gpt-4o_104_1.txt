Let's start by analyzing the information given:

- The total number of professors is 100.
- 75 of these professors are in computer science.
- 25 of these professors are in the humanities.

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:

\( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

And the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:

\( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we must consider how likely the provided description is for professors in both fields. 

Jason's interests and traits include:
- Coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with computer science.
- Not enjoying writing, which might be less common among humanities professors, given the nature of their work.
- Personality traits such as being conservative, careful, and ambitious, which could be more universally applicable but might align slightly better with the stereotypical profile of conservative and analytical professions like computer science.

Considering these factors, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) = how likely this description fits a computer science professor
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) = how likely this description fits a humanities professor

Given the description favors traits typically associated with computer science over humanities, letâ€™s hypothesize:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \) (very likely)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \) (not likely)

We then calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.
