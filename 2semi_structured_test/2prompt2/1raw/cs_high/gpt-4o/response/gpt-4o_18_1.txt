To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can employ Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25

The prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

We need to determine the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on Jason's interests and characteristics (enjoying coding, mathematical puzzles, and jogging), these traits are more commonly associated with computer science professors. 

We make a simplifying assumption given the provided description and assume that Jason's traits are much more likely to belong to a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D | CS) = \) the likelihood of the description given Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D | H) = \) the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
  
Given Jason's detailed preferences (coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assign a high likelihood to \( P(D | CS) \approx 1 \) and a much lower likelihood to \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \).

Then, according to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.968 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.968.

Answer: {"probability": "0.968"}
