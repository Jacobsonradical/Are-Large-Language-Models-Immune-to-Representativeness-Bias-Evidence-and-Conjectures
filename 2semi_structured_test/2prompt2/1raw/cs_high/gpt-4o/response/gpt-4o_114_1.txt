To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we are interested in the probability that Jason is from the group of computer science professors (\(CS\)) given the description (\(D\)).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the marginal probability of the description.

First, let's establish the basic probabilities:

1. Prior probability of being a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. Prior probability of being a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\):

- \(P(D|CS)\) is the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- \(P(D|H)\) is the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.

Based on the given description, Jason exhibits traits and interests (coding, solving puzzles) that are more commonly associated with computer science professors rather than humanities professors. Hence, we'll assume that:

- \(P(D|CS)\) is relatively high.
- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively low.

Letâ€™s make reasonable estimates:

- \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\)

Now, we can find the marginal probability \(P(D)\):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Finally, we can now use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(CS|D)\):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.964"}
\]
