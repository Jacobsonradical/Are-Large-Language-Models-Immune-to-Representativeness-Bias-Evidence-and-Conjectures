To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. 

We have the following information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to calculate the conditional probability of Jason being a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A|B) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) as the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from computer science (since there are 100 professors, 75 are in computer science, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
- \( P(B|A) \) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor).
- \( P(B) \) as the overall probability of the description.

Based on the description, Jason exhibits traits such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, which are generally more associated with computer science professors than humanities professors.

Given this strong alignment with computer science traits, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor, is high. For the sake of this example, let’s estimate it to be 0.9.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor, is low. For example, let’s estimate it to be 0.1.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.
