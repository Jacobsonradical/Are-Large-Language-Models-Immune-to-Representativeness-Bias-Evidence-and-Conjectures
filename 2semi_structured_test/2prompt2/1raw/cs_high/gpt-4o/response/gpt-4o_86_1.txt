Given the description of Jason and the information from the study, we need to determine the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor.

Let's use Bayes' rule for this purpose. Bayes' rule states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

To apply Bayes' rule, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \) - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \) - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \) - The total probability of Jason's description occurring.

First, let's determine the prior probability \( P(A) \).

The study included 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors. The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, consider the characteristics described. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more strongly associated with computer science than with the humanities. While we don't have exact numbers, we can safely assume that \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high. Conversely, humanities professors are less likely to match this description.

Let's assign some reasonable conjectural probabilities based on these assumptions:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood given his characteristics)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the description and the total number of humanities professors)

We need \( P(B) \), which can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

where \( \neg A \) represents the event of being a humanities professor.

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' rule to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
