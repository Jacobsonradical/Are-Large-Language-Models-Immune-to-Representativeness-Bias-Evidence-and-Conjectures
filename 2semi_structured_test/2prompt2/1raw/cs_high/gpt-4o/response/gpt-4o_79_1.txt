Given the description of Jason and the context of the study, we need to compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

**Bayes' Theorem** can be used here, which is stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided for Jason.

To solve this, we will need:
1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability, \( P(\neg A) \):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the humanities:
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \):** The probability that Jason has the given description assuming he is a computer science professor. Given the details in the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), this should be relatively high, letâ€™s assume:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|\neg A) \):** The probability that Jason has the given description assuming he is a humanities professor. Since the description heavily leans towards activities associated with computer science, let's assign this a lower probability:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

5. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \):** Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \approx 0.96 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ {\text {"probability": "0.96"}} \]
