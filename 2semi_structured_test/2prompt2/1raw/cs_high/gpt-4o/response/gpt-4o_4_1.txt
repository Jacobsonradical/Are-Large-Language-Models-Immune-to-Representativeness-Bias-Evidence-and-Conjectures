To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), which are the probabilities of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests a higher likelihood of him being a computer science professor.

Without precise numerical data, let's make a reasonable assumption based on the description:
- Suppose there's an 80% chance (0.8) that a computer science professor has the given traits.
- Suppose there's a 20% chance (0.2) that a humanities professor has the given traits.

Hence, we have:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \)

Finally, let's calculate \( P(D) \), which is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) â‰ˆ 0.923 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
