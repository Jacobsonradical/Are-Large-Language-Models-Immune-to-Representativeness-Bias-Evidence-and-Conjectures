To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The problem provides useful clues in the description, such as Jason's interests and personality traits, and also delineates the composition of the professor sample: 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

We start by defining our prior probabilities:
- Prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a professor is from computer science: \( 75/100 = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability \( P(\text{H}) \) that a professor is from the humanities: \( 25/100 = 0.25 \)

We then consider the likelihood of observing Jason's description given his field:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These activities are more closely associated with computer science than with the humanities.
- Given the description, it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

Although not quantified explicitly, we assume:
- Likelihood \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) that a computer science professor matches Jason's description is high, let's call it \( L_{\text{CS}} \).
- Likelihood \( P(D | \text{H}) \) that a humanities professor matches Jason's description is lower, let's call it \( L_{\text{H}} \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

Given:
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood he is a CS professor)
- \( P(D | \text{H}) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood he is a humanities professor)

We calculate:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
