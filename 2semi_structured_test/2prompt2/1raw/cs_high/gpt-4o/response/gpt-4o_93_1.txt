To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which in its simplest form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]


Here, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.


- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the description provided.

We need to determine:

1. \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(B|A)\): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(B)\): The total probability of Jason's description.


### 1. Prior Probability \(P(A)\):

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. Therefore:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that he is a humanities professor \(P(A')\) is:

\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]


### 2. Likelihood \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A')\):

Jason's interests and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) seem more consistent with computer science professors.

Assuming \[ P(B|A) \] is much higher than \[ P(B|A') \] because the attributes listed (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more characteristic of computer science professors:

Let's postulate a significant value for \( P(B|A) \), for example:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

And for \( P(B|A') \):

Given the description is less characteristic for humanities professors:
\[ P(B|A') = 0.1 \]


### 3. Total Probability \(P(B)\):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]


### Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]


Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
