In order to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probability (\( P(A) \)):**
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary prior probability (\( P(\neg A) \)):**
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)):**
   The description aligns with typical traits associated with computer science professors (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.). Let's assume that there is a high likelihood for this description to be of a computer science professor. For argument's sake, let's assume this is 0.9.

4. **Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(B|\neg A) \)):**
   The description less likely matches what we might stereotype as typical traits of a humanities professor. Let's assume this is 0.2.

Now, we need the total probability of the description (\( P(B) \)), which can be calculated as a weighted sum of the likelihoods:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
