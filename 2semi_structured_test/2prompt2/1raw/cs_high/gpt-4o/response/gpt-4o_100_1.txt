To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Initially, we have:
- The prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) \)
- The prior probability for Jason being a humanities professor: \( P(H) \)

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's describe the likelihood of observing Jason's personality characteristics given each hypothesis:
- The likelihood of Jason's characteristics given he is a computer science professor: \( P(D | CS) \)
- The likelihood of Jason's characteristics given he is a humanities professor: \( P(D | H) \)

Jason's characteristics, such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying writing, are stereotypically more aligned with computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:
\[ P(D | CS) > P(D | H) \]

For estimation:
- Suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \)
- Suppose \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Here is the answer in the required format:
