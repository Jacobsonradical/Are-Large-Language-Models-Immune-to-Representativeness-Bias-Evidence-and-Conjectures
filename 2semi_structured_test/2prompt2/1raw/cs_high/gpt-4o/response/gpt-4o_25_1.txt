To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the breakdown of the problem and the necessary calculation:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
   - P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75.

2. **Complementary Prior Probability (P(H)):**
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.
   - P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25.

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let's denote “traits” as the event representing Jason's personality description.
   - We need to estimate P(traits | CS) and P(traits | H).

Given Jason's traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely associated with computer science than the humanities, the likelihood P(traits | CS) is likely much higher than P(traits | H). Although we don't have exact numbers, we can reasonably assume:

- P(traits | CS) = high.
- P(traits | H) = quite low.

For these probabilities to be more useful, let’s assume:

- P(traits | CS) ≈ 0.9.
- P(traits | H) ≈ 0.1.

4. **Posterior Probability (P(CS | traits)):**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS | traits) = \frac{P(traits | CS) * P(CS)}{P(traits)}
   \]

   Where \( P(traits) \) can be calculated as:

   \[
   P(traits) = P(traits | CS) * P(CS) + P(traits | H) * P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(traits) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculate \( P(CS | traits) \):

   \[
   P(CS | traits) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} ≈ 0.9643
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96 or 96%.

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.96"}
```
