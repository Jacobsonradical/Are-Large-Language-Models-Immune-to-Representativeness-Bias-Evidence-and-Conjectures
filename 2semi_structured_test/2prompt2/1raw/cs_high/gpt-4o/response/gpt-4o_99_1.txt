To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason as given.

We are interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - To determine \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we need to consider how likely the description fits a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor.
   - Given that traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (along with being highly creative but not into drawing or writing) seem to align more with characteristics typically associated with computer science professors, we will assume higher likelihood for \( P(D|CS) \). Let's assign:
     - \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
     - \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Marginal Probability**:
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \)

Now, substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

So, we can conclude that the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the final answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
