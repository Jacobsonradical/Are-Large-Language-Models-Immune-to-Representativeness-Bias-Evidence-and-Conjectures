To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is given by: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the description provided for Jason.

We need to calculate:
1. \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(B|A)\): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(B)\): The overall probability of the description.

**Step 1: Calculate the prior probability (P(A))**

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**Step 2: Estimate the likelihood (P(B|A))**

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, these traits seem to align more closely with a computer science professor. We can reasonably assume that P(B|A) is higher. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the overall probability of the description (P(B))**

The overall probability takes into account both computer science and humanities professors. We need to find \( P(B|A') \) (where \(A'\) denotes Jason being a humanities professor):

Let's assume that the probability \(P(B|A')\) (Jason fitting the description given a humanities background) is lower due to the less likely fit based on interests. We could estimate:
\[ P(B|A') = 0.2 \]

Now, we calculate \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus:
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the posterior probability (P(A|B))**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.931.
