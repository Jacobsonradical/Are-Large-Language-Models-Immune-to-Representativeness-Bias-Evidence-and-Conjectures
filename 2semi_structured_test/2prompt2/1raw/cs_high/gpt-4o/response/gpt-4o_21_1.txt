To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. In this context, Bayes' theorem can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Letâ€™s break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**:
   The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{H}) \)**:
   The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)**:
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, these traits are more stereotypical of a computer science professor.

4. **Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \)**:
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. These traits are less likely for a humanities professor.

While exact numerical values for the likelihoods aren't provided, we can make an educated estimate. Let's assume:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \] (since the description fits a typical profile of a computer science professor quite well)
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 0.1 \] (since the description fits a typical profile of a humanities professor quite poorly)

5. **Overall Probability \( P(\text{Description}) \)**:
   The overall probability of the description can be computed using the law of total probability.
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
