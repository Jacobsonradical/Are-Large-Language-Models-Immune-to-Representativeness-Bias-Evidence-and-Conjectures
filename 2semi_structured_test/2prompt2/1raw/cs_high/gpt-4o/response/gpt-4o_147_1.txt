To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let’s identify the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- And \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Next, we need an estimate of \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a computer science professor would match the description.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that a humanities professor would match the description.

Given the description (interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, but not enjoying drawing or writing), it is more likely to match a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We can make reasonable but rough estimates based on provided information:
- Let’s reasonably estimate \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability for a computer science professor to have this description).
- Let’s reasonably estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability for a humanities professor to have this description).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.675) + (0.025) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
