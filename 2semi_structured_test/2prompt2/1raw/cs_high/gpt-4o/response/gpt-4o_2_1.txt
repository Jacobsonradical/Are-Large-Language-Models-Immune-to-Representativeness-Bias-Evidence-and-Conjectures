Given the description of Jason, we need to use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor.

We can sift through this via Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \): Prior probability of being in computer science
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \): Likelihood of the description given the professor is from computer science
- \( P(\text{Description}) \): Marginal probability of getting the description

### Step 1: Prior Probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \)
There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

\[
P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \)
The description points to traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing. These traits are typically more closely associated with computer science than humanities. Suppose we assume (based on the description and common archetypes) that there's a high probability, say 0.9, that such a description fits a computer science professor.

\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = 0.9
\]

### Step 3: Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)
Given the description is not very typical for a humanities professor, we might assign a lower probability to this, say 0.1.

\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.1
\]

### Step 4: Marginal Probability \( P(\text{Description}) \)
Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

### Step 5: Posterior Probability
Now apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = \frac{675}{700} \approx 0.964
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.964"\}
\]
