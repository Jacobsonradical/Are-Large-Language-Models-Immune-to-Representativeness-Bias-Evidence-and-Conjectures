First, let's consider the base rates of the two groups:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability (base rate) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability (base rate) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, we need to evaluate how likely such a description fits a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. 

**Traits Analysis:**

- **Coding, solving mathematical puzzles**: These activities are more commonly associated with computer science professors.
- **Jogging**: This is a neutral activity and doesn't particularly lean towards one profession.
- **Highly creative**: Creativity can be common in both fields, although traditionally associated more with the humanities.
- **Does not enjoy drawing or writing**: This leans slightly away from humanities, as writing might be more common in that field.

Given these considerations, the likelihood that this description fits a computer science professor seems quite high compared to a humanities professor due to the specific mention of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of a computer science background.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \propto P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities} | \text{description}) \propto P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Assuming these conditional probabilities based on the description:

- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is high.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) is relatively low.

Since the description strongly aligns with typical characteristics of a computer science professor and less so with a humanities professor, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is quite high.

Approximating these likelihoods for ease:
\[ P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, we apply these to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{ P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) }{ P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) } \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{ 0.9 \times 0.75 }{ 0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25 } \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{ 0.675 }{ 0.675 + 0.025 } \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{ 0.675 }{ 0.7 } \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
