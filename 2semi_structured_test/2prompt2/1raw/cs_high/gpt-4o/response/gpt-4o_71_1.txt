To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason matches the given description.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we evaluate the description, which includes interests and personality traits more common in computer science. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are generally more aligned with computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- The probability of a computer science professor matching the description (\( P(D|CS) \)) is relatively high. We can estimate this as 0.8.
- The probability of a humanities professor matching the description (\( P(D|H) \)) is relatively low. We can estimate this as 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.8 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
