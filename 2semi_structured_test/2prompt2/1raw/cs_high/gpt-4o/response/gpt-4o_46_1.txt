Certainly! We can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief based on the given evidence.

Given:

- Number of computer science professors (\(C\)) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 25
- Total professors = 100

We want to find the posterior probability \(P(C|D)\), where \(D\) is the description of Jason.

Let's break down Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

Firstly, the prior probability \(P(C)\) is:
\[P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

Secondly, the prior probability \(P(H)\) (for humanities) is:
\[P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

The description fits the stereotype of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor due to interests like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing. Thus, we will assume \(P(D|C)\) is higher than \(P(D|H)\).

For simplicity, let's assign some reasonable likelihoods:
- \(P(D|C) = 0.9\) (as the description fits a computer science professor quite well)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\) (as the description does not fit a typical humanities professor well)

Now, we calculate \(P(D)\):
\[P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)\]
\[P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025\]
\[P(D) = 0.7\]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.75)}{0.7}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}\]
\[P(C|D) \approx 0.964\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.964.
