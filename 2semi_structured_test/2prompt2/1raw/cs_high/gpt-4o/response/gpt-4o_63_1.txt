To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description:

- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are typical of computer science professors.
- Jason's dislike for drawing or writing also skews away from typical humanities interests.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assign higher probabilities to the description given Jason is a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor:

- Let’s assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \), as the description strongly aligns with characteristics of computer science professors.
- Let’s assume \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \), as the description contradicts the typical interests of humanities professors.

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
