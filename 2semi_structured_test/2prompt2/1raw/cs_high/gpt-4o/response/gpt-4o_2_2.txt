To answer this question, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability. Here's how it can be approached:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   And the prior probability for Jason being a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood** (based on the description):
   The description highlights traits and hobbies that are more typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. While exact likelihood values are not given, we can reasonably infer that the likelihood of this description being that of a computer science professor is higher.

   Let:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = p_1
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = p_2
   \]

   Since Jason's characteristics align more with a computer science professor, we can assume:
   \[
   p_1 > p_2
   \]

3. **Normalization**:
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{Humanities} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Normalizing factor \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be written as:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Since we do not have the exact \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) values but we know \( p_1 > p_2 \), and combined with the priors, we infer a high probability.

Given that the prior probability (75%) and the likelihood strongly suggest that Jason has characteristics strongly aligned with a computer science professor, we can reasonably estimate the posterior probability to be quite high, but recognizing that not all humanities professors have complete aversion to coding/math.

Thus, combining these factors:

\[
{"probability": "0.95"}
\]
