To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's identify these probabilities:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since we have 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **\( P(B) \)**: The total probability of Jason's description. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (since \( \neg A \) is the complement of A):
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **\( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor. Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and lack of interest in drawing or writing provide strong evidence that he is likely a computer science professor. We can assign a high probability to this (e.g., 0.9).

4. **\( P(B|\neg A) \)**: The probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor. Given Jason's interests contrast with typical activities of humanities professors, this probability should be lower (e.g., 0.1).

Now let's calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
