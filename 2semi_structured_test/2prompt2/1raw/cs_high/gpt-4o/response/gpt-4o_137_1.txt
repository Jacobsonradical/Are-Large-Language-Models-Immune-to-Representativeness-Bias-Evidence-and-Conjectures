To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS) given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches the given traits.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a CS professor. There are 75 CS professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(A^c) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, let's consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which align well with typical traits of a CS professor, this probability should be relatively high. For the sake of our calculation, let's assume it is 0.9.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor. Given Jason's description, it seems less likely for a humanities professor, and we will assume this probability to be lower. For this example, let's assume it is 0.2.

Finally, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the given description. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
