Given the description, we need to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors.

First, we should use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this probability. Let C denote the event that Jason is a CS professor, and H denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We are interested in \( P(C | \text{description}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the problem:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

For \( P(\text{description} | C) \) we assume that the traits described (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, being highly creative but not liking drawing or writing) are more characteristic of a CS professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote these probabilities as \( P(\text{description} | C) = p_1 \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) = p_2 \), where \( p_1 > p_2 \).

Since we don't have exact probabilities, we will assume reasonable approximate values. Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.2 \)

Then, we calculate \( P(\text{description}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Now substituting all values in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

The answer in the required format is:
{"probability": "0.923"}
