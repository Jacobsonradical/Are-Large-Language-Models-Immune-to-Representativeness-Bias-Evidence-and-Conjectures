To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason has the given description.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: The probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of Jason having the described traits given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the activities and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging), it seems likely that such a description would fit a computer science professor. Let's assume this probability is relatively high, say:

\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: The probability of Jason having the described traits given that he is a humanities professor. Given the mismatch between humanities interests and technical activities, this probability would be lower. Let's assume this probability is relatively low, say:

\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \]

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the total probability of the description regardless of whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Now, we can use these values to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.
