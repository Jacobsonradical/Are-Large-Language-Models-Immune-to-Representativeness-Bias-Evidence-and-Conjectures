To evaluate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

First, we define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

The prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, consider the description:
Jason is conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science.

Assuming that Jason's interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles) are more likely to be seen in computer science professors than humanities professors, letâ€™s evaluate two cases qualitatively:

- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. (This is likely high)
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. (This is likely low)

Let's reasonably approximate values based on these assumptions:
- \( P(D|A) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|B) \approx 0.1 \)

We need \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|D) \):

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.964"}} \]
