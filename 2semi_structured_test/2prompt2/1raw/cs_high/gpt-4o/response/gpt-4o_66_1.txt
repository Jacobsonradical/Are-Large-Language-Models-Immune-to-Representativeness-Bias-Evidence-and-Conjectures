To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We want to compute the probability \( P(C|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Here's how we break this down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Given the study data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.

So, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities which are typically more common in computer science than the humanities. Without precise data on these likelihoods, we can assume that \( P(D|C) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \). For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Total Probability**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

The answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
