To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, we'll define the relevant quantities:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the given description if the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): Probability of the given description if the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the given description.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we will assume that Jason's description aligns more with typical traits expected of computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles) than humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood the description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood the description fits a humanities professor)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

So,
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
