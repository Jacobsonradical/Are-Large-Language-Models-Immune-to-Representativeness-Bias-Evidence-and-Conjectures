To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to state the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that he is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we account for the evidence:
- \( P(Description \mid CS) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description \mid H) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a humanities professor.

Based on the description:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing are traits more aligned with a computer science professor than a professor in the humanities.

Given this strong alignment, let's assume:
- \( P(Description \mid CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood)
- \( P(Description \mid H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{P(Description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid Description) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.964.

The final answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
