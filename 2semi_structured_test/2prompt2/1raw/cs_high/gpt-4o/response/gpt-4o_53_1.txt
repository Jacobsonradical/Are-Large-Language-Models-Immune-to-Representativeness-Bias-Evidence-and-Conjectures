To solve this, let's use Bayes' Theorem, which combines prior knowledge with new evidence to make a probabilistic inference. Here is the step-by-step application:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let's denote the descriptor as D.
   - We need to estimate P(D|CS) and P(D|H). Firstly, the description includes elements like "enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles" which are highly indicative of a computer science professor.

   We'll make an educated guess based on the description's content:
   - P(D|CS) is very high because coding and mathematical puzzles are not typically associated with humanities.
   - P(D|H) is likely to be very low for the same reasons.

   Let's assume:
   - P(D|CS) = 0.95 (high chance given these interests)
   - P(D|H) = 0.05 (low chance given these interests)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:

   Using Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.75}{(0.95 \times 0.75) + (0.05 \times 0.25)}
   \]

   Simplifying the values in the numerator:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7125}{0.7125 + 0.0125} = \frac{0.7125}{0.725} \approx 0.983
   \]

   Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.983.

So, the answer in the requested format would be:

```json
{"probability": "0.983"}
