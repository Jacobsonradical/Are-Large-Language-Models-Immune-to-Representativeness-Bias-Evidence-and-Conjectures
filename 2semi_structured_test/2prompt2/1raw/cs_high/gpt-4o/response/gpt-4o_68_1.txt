To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, and it is often used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of hypothesis A given the evidence B (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of evidence B given that hypothesis A is true (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of evidence B under all hypotheses (marginal probability).

Let's define our events:
- \( A_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A_{CS}|B) \). Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each term:
1. \( P(A_{CS}) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given the characteristics mentioned (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing), this seems to align well with a computer science professor. We can assign this a high probability (say 0.9).

3. \( P(B|A_H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Given that the personality traits and interests mentioned are less typical for a humanities professor, we can assign this a lower probability (say 0.1).

4. \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description \( B \). This is the weighted sum of the probabilities for both groups:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_H) \cdot P(A_H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can compute \( P(A_{CS}|B) \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
