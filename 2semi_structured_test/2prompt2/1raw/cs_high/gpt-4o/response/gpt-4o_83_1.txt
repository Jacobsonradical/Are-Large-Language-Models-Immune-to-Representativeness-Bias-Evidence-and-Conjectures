To solve this, let's apply Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

First, we need to define some terms:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.

Thus, the prior probability:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). Based on the description, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles seem highly aligned with a computer science professor's profile, while his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing and his conservative demeanor might be less associated with humanities professors.

Without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we have to rely on a logical assumption:

Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|Hum) \). 

For simplicity, let’s determine \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \).

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]

\[
= 0.9643
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
