To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description among all professors.

First, letâ€™s establish our prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \) = probability of being a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = probability of being a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \), the likelihoods of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given the description (enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it seems much more likely for Jason to be a computer science professor. While there's no exact numerical value given, we can assume:
- \( P(B|CS) \) > \( P(B|H) \)

For this example, we can assign reasonable estimations based on typical characteristics:
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now, we need \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.9643"}
