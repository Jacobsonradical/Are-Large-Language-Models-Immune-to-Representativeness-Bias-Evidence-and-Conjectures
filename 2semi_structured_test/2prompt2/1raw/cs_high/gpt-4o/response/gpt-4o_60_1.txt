To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, let's use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The provided description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each of these probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of having the description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The marginal probability of having the description (B), regardless of Jason's profession.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, let's make reasonable assumptions to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, it is very likely \( P(B|A) \) is high. Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).
- Given Jason's lack of interest in drawing or writing, which are more common in the humanities, \( P(B|\neg A) \) is likely low. Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

We now need to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
