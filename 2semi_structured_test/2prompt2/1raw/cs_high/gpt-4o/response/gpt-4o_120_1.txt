To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the specific description of Jason.

Given data:
- 75 computer science professors (\( P(C) = 0.75 \))
- 25 humanities professors (\( P(H) = 0.25 \))

We need to compute \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) * P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) * P(C) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]

Next, we estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \):

Given the description about Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) and personality (conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious), which align more with typical traits of computer science professors, we can assume:

- \( P(D | C) \): High probability (let's assume around 0.9)
- \( P(D | H) \): Lower probability (let's assume around 0.2)

Now we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.2 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C | D) â‰ˆ 0.931 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.931.
