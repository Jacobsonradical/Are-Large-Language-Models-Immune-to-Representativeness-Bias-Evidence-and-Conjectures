We need to evaluate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. We can use Bayesian reasoning to update our prior probability based on the information provided in the description.

Here's the process:
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(CS) = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the characteristics:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: More indicative of a computer science professor.
- Creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing: May be more likely in a technical field like computer science.

Given this description skews heavily towards characteristics more common in computer science professors, we can infer that the likelihood is higher for this group.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

While we don't have explicit numeric values for \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \), qualitatively we can estimate that:
- The description fits a computer science professor significantly more (let's assign an arbitrary likelihood ratio of 9:1 for simplicity).

So,
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx \frac{9 \cdot 0.75}{9 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx \frac{6.75}{6.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx \frac{6.75}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

Answer: {"probability": "0.964"}
