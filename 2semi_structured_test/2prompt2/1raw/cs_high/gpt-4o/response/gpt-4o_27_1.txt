To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps and considerations involved:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
    - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
    - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
    - We need to assess how likely it is that a professor with Jason's description is from each group.
    - Given the description, Jason seems to align more with traits common in computer science professors (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles), and less with typical humanities traits (e.g., enjoying drawing or writing).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
    - The likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor (let's denote this as \( L(J | CS) \)) is higher than his likelihood of being a humanities professor (let's denote this as \( L(J | H) \)).
    - However, we don't have the exact likelihood values, but given the description, we can reasonably assert that \( L(J | CS) \) is significantly greater than \( L(J | H) \).
   
   Let \( k \) be a proportionality constant, the posterior probability can be approximated as:
    \[
    P(CS | J) = \frac{P(J | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(J | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(J | H) \cdot P(H)}
    \]
    Given \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = 0.25 \), 
    Also assuming \( L(J | CS) / L(J | H) \gg 1 \) based on the described traits (this implies a likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1),
    we can approximate that the posterior probability will be closer to the upper bound for computer science professors.

Considering these points and the qualitative assessment of the likelihood, a reasonable posterior probability is higher than the prior but not absolute. Let's choose a probability acknowledging a strong but not overwhelming likelihood:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.9"}}
\]
