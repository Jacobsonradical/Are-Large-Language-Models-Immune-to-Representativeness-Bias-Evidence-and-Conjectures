To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayesian reasoning.

### Given Data:
- Total number of professors: 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- **Prior probability (before description)**:
  - Probability that a professor is in computer science, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - Probability that a professor is in the humanities, \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### Description and Likelihoods:
From the description of Jason, he enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seem more aligned with activities common among computer science professionals. His disinterest in drawing or writing also suggests a fit more aligned with computer science over humanities.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) = the event of getting a description like Jason's

Now, we'll make some reasonable assumptions for the sake of calculation:
- \( P(E|\text{CS}) \) = probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science is very high, say 0.9
- \( P(E|\text{H}) \) = probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities is very low, say 0.1

### Bayes' Theorem:
Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) = P(E|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \)

So calculating step by step:
1. **Calculate \( P(E) \)**:
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

2. **Calculate \( P(\text{CS}|E) \)**:
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|E) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

### Answer:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
