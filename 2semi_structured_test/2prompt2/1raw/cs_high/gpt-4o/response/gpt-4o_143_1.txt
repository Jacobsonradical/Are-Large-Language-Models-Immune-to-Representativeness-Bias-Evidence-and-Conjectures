To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: 
   \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities:
   \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood** of the description given the professor's department:
   - Let \( D \) be the description provided for Jason. We need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \).
   - Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These activities are stereotypically more associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors.
   - Assume we estimate:
     - \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood for a computer science professor)
     - \( P(D | Hum) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood for a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability** (using Bayes' theorem):
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \)

Plugging in the numbers:
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \)
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \)
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \)
   - \( P(CS | D) \approx 0.923 \)

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
