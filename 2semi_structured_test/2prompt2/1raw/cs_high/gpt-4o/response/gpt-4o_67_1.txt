Given the description of Jason, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor.

First, let's define:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) = Jason is a humanities professor

We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the description given the occupation. While we don't have exact probabilities, we can make educated assumptions based on the description:

- The description mentions activities and traits that are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Given this, let's reasonably assume that such a description is much more likely for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | A) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | B) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(A|\text{description}) \):

\[
P(A|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

We also need to compute \( P(\text{description}) \), which is the total probability of the description:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{description}|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substitute the values we assumed:

\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Now, compute the posterior probability:

\[
P(A|\text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
