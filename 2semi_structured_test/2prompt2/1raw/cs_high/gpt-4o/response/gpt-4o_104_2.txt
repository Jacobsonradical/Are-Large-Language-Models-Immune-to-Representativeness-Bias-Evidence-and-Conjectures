Given the description of Jason, we can approach this problem by using Bayes' theorem. 

First, we identify the prior probabilities:
1. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
2. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we use Jason's description to update these probabilities. Although we don't have exact likelihoods, we can infer some things based on Jason's description.

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more typical activities associated with computer science professors. On the other hand, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities more likely associated with humanities professors.

Therefore, we can reasonably assume that the likelihood of this description for a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \), is higher than for a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \).

Assuming:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \): High likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \): Low likelihood that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor.

Now we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, given the description, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.96"}
