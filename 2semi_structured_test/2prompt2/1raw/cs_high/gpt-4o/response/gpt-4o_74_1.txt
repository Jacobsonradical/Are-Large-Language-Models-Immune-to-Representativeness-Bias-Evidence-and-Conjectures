To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define our variables:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \). Jason's description includes liking coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Therefore, let's assume:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 \]  (A high likelihood, given the alignment of interests with typical CS activities)
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \]  (A low likelihood, given the less typical alignment with humanities activities)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Let's compute \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Here is the answer in the required format:
