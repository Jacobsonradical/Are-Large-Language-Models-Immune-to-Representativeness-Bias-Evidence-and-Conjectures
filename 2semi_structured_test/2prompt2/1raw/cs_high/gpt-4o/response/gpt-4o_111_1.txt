To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's how Bayes' Theorem is applied in this context:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description coming from either group of professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the proportion of computer science professors in the sample).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the proportion of humanities professors in the sample).

Without loss of generality, let's assume that the description is much more likely for a computer science professor, rather than for a humanities professor, based on interests and traits mentioned in Jason's description. For this, let's set:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

Using these probabilities, we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
