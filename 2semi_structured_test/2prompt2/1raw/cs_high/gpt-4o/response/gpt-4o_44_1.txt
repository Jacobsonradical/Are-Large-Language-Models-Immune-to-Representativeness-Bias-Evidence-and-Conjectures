To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \quad \text{and} \quad P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

Now we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):

The description mentions characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

Assume, based on professional judgment (without specific numerical data), that the likelihood of the description among computer science professors is much higher. For the sake of simplicity, we assign:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{(0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
