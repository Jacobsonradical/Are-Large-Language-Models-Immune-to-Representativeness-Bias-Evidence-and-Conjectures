To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the formulation for probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \(D\).

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

1. Prior Probabilities:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Description \(D\) contains elements that align better with typical computer science interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Thus, let's assume:
   \[ P(D|CS) > P(D|H) \]

Given these alignments, we can make a reasonable assumption that \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \). For simplicity and estimation, let's assume:
   \[ P(D|CS) = 0.8 \]
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \]

3. Total Probability of the Description:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.

Therefore, the answer can be formatted as follows:

{"probability": "0.923"}
