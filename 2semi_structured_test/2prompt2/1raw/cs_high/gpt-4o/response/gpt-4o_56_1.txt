To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence. We'll base our calculation on the given traits and the distribution of professors between computer science and humanities.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)):
     - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
     - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)):
     - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
     - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood (\( P(description | CS) \)) that Jason’s description fits a computer science professor.
     - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy writing or drawing — traits more likely to align with computer science professors.

   - The likelihood (\( P(description | H) \)) that Jason’s description fits a humanities professor.
     - Despite Jason's highly creative nature, other traits like enjoying mathematical puzzles and coding are less common in humanities professors.

   We'll make a reasonable assumption that:
   - \( P(description | CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(description | H) \). For our purposes, let's assume:
     - \( P(description | CS) = 0.9 \)
     - \( P(description | H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes’ theorem: 

   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | H) * P(H)}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
