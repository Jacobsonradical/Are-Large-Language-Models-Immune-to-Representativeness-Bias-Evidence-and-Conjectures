Given the description of Jason, we need to update our beliefs about whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on the information provided. 

First, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:

- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

For this problem:

- Prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The likelihood term \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) would qualitatively assess how well the description fits a typical computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Based on the details given:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These are indicative traits of someone more likely in the computer science field, given the professional culture and interests typically associated with such professors. 

Since we don't have exact numerical likelihoods, let's assume the qualitative description aligns strongly with a computer science professor. We assign a higher likelihood ratio to \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) being around 0.9 and \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) being around 0.1, reflecting our strong intuition.

Thus,
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.70} = \frac{0.675}{0.70} = 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
