To assess the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's what we know:
- The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer scientist is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is in the humanities is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We need to find the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description provided (Jason's characteristics) given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of the description provided given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may be more likely activities associated with the humanities.

We can reasonably assume that the likelihood of a computer science professor having characteristics described for Jason \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than a humanities professor having these characteristics \( P(D|Hum) \).

Let \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (a reasonably high likelihood given Jason's clear inclination towards activities associated with computer science).
Let \( P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \) (a low likelihood given the mismatch of his activities with a typical humanities focus).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

where \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring, which can be calculated as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

Substituting in the values:
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.9643"}
