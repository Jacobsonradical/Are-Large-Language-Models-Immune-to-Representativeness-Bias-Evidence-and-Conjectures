To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be represented as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

We start by determining \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \), which are the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), which are the likelihoods:

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to be a computer science professor due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. Professors in computer science are likely to have such interests. Hence, we assign a higher probability for \( P(D | CS) \).

Similarly, while humanities professors can also be conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, the specific interests in coding and mathematical puzzles make it less likely.

For illustration purposes, let's assume:

\[ P(D | CS) = 0.9 \]  (high probability given his interests align well with computer science)

\[ P(D | H) = 0.1 \]  (lower probability given his interests are less typical for humanities)

Finally, we calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
