First, consider the prior probabilities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is from each group. Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing make it more likely that he is a computer science professor. These attributes are more characteristic of someone in computer science than in the humanities.

Let's assign a higher likelihood of this description for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. While exact numbers for these likelihoods are not provided in the problem, we can make a reasonable assumption based on common knowledge and the descriptions' specifics.

Assume:
\[ P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(H | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})} \]

The total probability of the description is:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.964"} \]
