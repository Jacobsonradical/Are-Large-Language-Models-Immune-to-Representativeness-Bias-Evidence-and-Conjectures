Given the information provided, you would need to consider both the base rate of the two groups of professors and the description provided.

First, let's break down the problem using Bayes' theorem.

1. **Base Rate**: 
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - The description provides characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which appear to align more closely with the typical activities and interests of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
   
Given these characteristics, we need to evaluate the likelihood of Jason being in each group. Generally, the traits described seem more aligned with a computer science professor. This would suggest that the likelihood \( P(description | computer\ science) \) is higher than \( P(description | humanities) \).

Now, let’s denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
\]
\[
P(H | description) = \frac{P(description | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(description)}
\]

Since \( P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \):

Let’s assume \( P(description | CS) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(description | H) \approx 0.1 \), taking into account that Jason’s traits are more consistent with those of a computer science professor.

Then, calculating the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{(0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
