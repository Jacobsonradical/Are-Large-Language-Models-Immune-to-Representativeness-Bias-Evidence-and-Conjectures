To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of Jason's description.

Let's work through the relevant probabilities step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   We need to subjectively assess how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. His enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests computer science, while his lack of interest in drawing or writing also seems consistent with this field.
   Given these traits are highly indicative of a computer science professor, we might estimate:
   \[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \]

3. **Marginal Probability, \( P(B) \)**:
   This is the total probability of Jason's description across both groups.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964 or 96.4%.

So the answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
