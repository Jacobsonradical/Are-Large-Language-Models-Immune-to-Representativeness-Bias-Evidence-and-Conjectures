To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting Jason's description.

We need to calculate the components of this formula:

1. **Prior probability, \( P(A) \), that Jason is a computer science professor**:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability, \( P(A^c) \), that Jason is a humanities professor**:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \), of getting Jason's description if he is a computer science professor**:
   Based on the given description—enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and has traits not traditionally associated with the humanities (e.g., does not enjoy drawing or writing)—we can reasonably assume that this description is more likely for a computer science professor. To quantify this, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \] (high likelihood)

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A^c) \), of getting Jason's description if he is a humanities professor**:
   Since the traits described (particularly enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are less likely for a humanities professor, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \] (low likelihood)

5. **Total probability, \( P(B) \)**:
Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

The final answer is:
{"probability": "0.96"}
