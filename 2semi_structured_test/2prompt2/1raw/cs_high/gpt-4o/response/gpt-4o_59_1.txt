To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can structure this problem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood that Jason's description matches that of a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood that Jason's description matches that of a humanities professor.

Given the description, Jason seems to have characteristics more typically associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). So, we can infer that the likelihood \( P(D | CS) \) is higher than \( P(D | H) \). Without specific numerical values for these likelihoods, let's assume reasonable estimates based on the description:

- Suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (very likely given the description).
- Suppose \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (less likely given the description).

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately **0.9643**.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
