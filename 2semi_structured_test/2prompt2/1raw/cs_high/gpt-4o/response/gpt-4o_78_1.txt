To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{HU} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description given for Jason.

### Prior Probabilities

Since the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
  \[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
  \[ P(A_{HU}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Likelihoods

The likelihoods are the probabilities of the given description fitting either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given Jason's interests and characteristics (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, high creativity but not enjoying drawing or writing), it is reasonable to assume these traits are more likely associated with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B | A_{CS}) \approx 0.9 \) (since his traits strongly lean towards those typical of a computer science professor)
- \( P(B | A_{HU}) \approx 0.1 \) (since his traits are less likely to describe a humanities professor)

### Overall Probability of Description \( P(B) \)

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B | A_{HU}) \cdot P(A_{HU}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

### Posterior Probability

Now, weâ€™ll compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS} | B) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
