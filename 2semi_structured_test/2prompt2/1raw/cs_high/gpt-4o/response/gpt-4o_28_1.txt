Let's break down the information provided in the description and use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are:
  * P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
  * P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits suggest a higher likelihood of being a CS professor because:
- Coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more closely associated with computer science.
- Lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing might skew away from the humanities.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We approximate:
- P(description | CS) is likely high because coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators for CS.
- P(description | Humanities) is likely low because there is no mention of writing or other activities more common in humanities.

Assuming, conservatively:
- P(description | CS) = 0.9
- P(description | Humanities) = 0.2

The total probability of the description appearing:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ = 0.725 \]

Now, calculating the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ = 0.930 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
