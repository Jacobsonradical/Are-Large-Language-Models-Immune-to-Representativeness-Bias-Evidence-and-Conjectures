To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) represents being a computer science professor.
- \(B\) represents fitting Jason's description.

First, let's categorize our known probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor. Out of the 100 professors, 75 are computer science professors, so:
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of fitting Jason's description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of fitting Jason's description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \(P(\neg A)\) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor:
  \[
  P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

To proceed, we need to guess the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) based on the description. Jason's characteristics (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, and dislike for writing/drawing) are more stereotypical of a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high, perhaps 0.8
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively low, perhaps 0.2

Now we calculate the normalizing constant \( P(B) \) (overall probability of fitting the description):
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = 0.8 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

So, Jason is highly likely to be a computer science professor. The posterior probability is approximately:
\[
{"probability": "0.92"}
\]
