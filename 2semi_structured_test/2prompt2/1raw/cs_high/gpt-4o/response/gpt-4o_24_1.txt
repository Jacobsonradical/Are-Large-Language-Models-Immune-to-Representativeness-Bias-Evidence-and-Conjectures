To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or description provided about Jason.

First, let’s define and compute the components of Bayes' theorem:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

### 1. Prior Probability \( P(A) \)
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### 2. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)
We need to consider how likely it is that the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason’s interests and activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing), it seems more aligned with characteristics associated with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor.

For the sake of this calculation, let’s assign some plausible values based on the description:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches the description. Let’s assume this is high, say \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \): Probability that a humanities professor matches the description. Let’s assume this is low, say \( 0.1 \).

### 3. Overall Probability \( P(B) \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

### 4. Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
