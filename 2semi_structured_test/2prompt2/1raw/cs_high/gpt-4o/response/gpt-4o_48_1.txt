To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description fits Jason.

Let's break this down into the relevant components:

1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description fitting any professor.

### Step 1: Prior Probability
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Likelihood
Given the description involves coding and solving mathematical puzzles (traits more closely related to computer science), the likelihood for a computer science professor (\( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \)) is higher than for a humanities professor (\( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \)):

We can make educated assumptions:
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) (likelihood description fits a CS professor): high, say 0.90.
- \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \) (likelihood description fits a humanities professor): low, say 0.10.

### Step 3: Total Probability
\( P(B) \): The overall probability of observing the description.

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}})P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}})P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.90 \times 0.75) + (0.10 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70 \]

### Applying Bayesâ€™ Theorem

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}})P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.75}{0.70} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = 0.9643 \]

### Conclusion
The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
