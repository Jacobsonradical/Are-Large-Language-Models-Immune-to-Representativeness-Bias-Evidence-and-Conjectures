To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided.

We want to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We make some reasonable assumptions based on the description:
- Description mentions coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely to be hobbies of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.
- The conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious traits can seem neutral but tilt slightly towards the typical profile of a computer science professor.

Thus, let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is high, say 0.9 based on the frequency of matching traits.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is low, say 0.1 since the traits do not typically align with humanities professors.

Now, let's plug these values into Bayes' theorem and calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can find \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.964 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
