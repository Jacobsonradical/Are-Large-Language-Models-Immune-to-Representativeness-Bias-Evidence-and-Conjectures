To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting the description.

We start with the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Where \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Now, we need estimates for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a computer science professor has the description provided.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that a humanities professor has the description provided.

Given the description of Jason, we see attributes like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more aligned with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor, suggesting that \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high.

Since we are not given exact probabilities in the problem, we can make reasonable estimates:

Let \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (Jason’s description is more typical for a computer science professor.)
Let \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (Jason’s description is less typical for a humanities professor.)

Using these, we can calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]
