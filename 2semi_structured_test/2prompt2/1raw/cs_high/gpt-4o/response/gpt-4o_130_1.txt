To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

The information we have includes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's description matches certain stereotypes more common in computer science than in the humanities (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, being less interested in drawing or writing).

We'll use Bayes' theorem which is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description for any professor.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (computer science)
- \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (humanities)

Assume:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is high because the description fits a computer science professor well.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) is low because the description doesn't fit typical humanities characteristics well.

While exact likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) are not given, it's reasonable to assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is much greater than \( P(B|A_{H}) \).

We can simplify the calculation by making a qualitative assumption that the probability associated with \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) dominates. If we assumed \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 1 \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0 \), Bayes' theorem would simplify:

Since these are extremes,
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \approx \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.75 + 0.25 \cdot P(B|A_{H})/1} \]
Since \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is much larger,

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{75}{(75 + 25)} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be estimated as:
