To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (our goal).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason having the given description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason having the given description under all categories.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now we need \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Characteristics like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging are more likely to be associated with computer science professors.

Although exact probabilities aren't provided, we will assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high. Let's reasonably estimate \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) based on the description.

Next, let's consider \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Since the description aligns less with usual humanities traits, \( P(B|A^c) \) would reasonably be lower. Let's assume \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \).

Finally, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \), which considers both categories (computer science and humanities):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.9643.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
