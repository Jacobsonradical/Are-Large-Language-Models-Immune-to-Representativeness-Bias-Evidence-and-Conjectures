To calculate the posterior probability, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(C) \) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25

We need to evaluate how the description fits the profile of computer science versus humanities professors. Since Bayes' Theorem requires the likelihoods, we can make the following assumptions based on the provided description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which could be more common in humanities.

Assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \), the probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor, is relatively high. Let's estimate it to be 0.9 for the sake of calculation.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \), the probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor, is relatively low. Let's estimate it to be 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \times P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \times P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \times P(H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
