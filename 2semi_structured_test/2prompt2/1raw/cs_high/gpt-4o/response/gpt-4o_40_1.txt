To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability Jason is a humanities professor)

What we need to find is \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \).

Now we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): Likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Humanities) \): Likelihood of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on Jason's description:
- He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities more typical of a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that are more related to humanities.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) is much higher than \( P(D|Humanities) \).

For the purpose of this estimation, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|Humanities) \approx 0.1 \)

Then, the denominator \( P(D) \) is:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.
