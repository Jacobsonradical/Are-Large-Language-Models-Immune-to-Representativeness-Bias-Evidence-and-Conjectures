Let's approach this problem using Bayes' theorem, which gives us a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, we set our prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the observed description given the professor's field. Given the description, Jason seems to have traits and interests linked more closely with computer science, such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and enjoying jogging, which might be more prevalent among CS professors compared to humanities professors. While we don't have specific data on trait frequency, we can reasonably assume that these traits are more common among CS professors based on the context.

Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor, and \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. We can suppose that:

- \( P(D|CS) \) is higher, let's say \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D|H) \) is lower, let's say \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.923"}
