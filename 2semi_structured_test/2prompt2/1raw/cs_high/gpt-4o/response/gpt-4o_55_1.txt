To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

By the given data:

- Number of computer science professors, \( CS \) = 75
- Number of humanities professors, \( H \) = 25
- Total professors, \( T \) = 100

So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description strongly suggests activities (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) more characteristic of computer science professors, we assume:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \gg P(\text{description} | H) \)

Let's assume a ratio to reflect the likelihood difference:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1 \)

Now using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

The total probability of the description is:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now substitute back:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.9643 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643, which can be formatted as:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
