To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's contextualize these terms for our problem:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) is the event of obtaining Jason's specific description.

First, we calculate the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Given Jason’s interest in coding, solving puzzles, and jogging, these traits seem much more common among computer science professors than humanities professors, let's assume that:
  - \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (highly likely given the description matches typical traits of computer science professors)
  - \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \) (less likely given these traits less match humanities professors)

Finally, we need to find \( P(B) \), the overall likelihood of Jason’s description. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
