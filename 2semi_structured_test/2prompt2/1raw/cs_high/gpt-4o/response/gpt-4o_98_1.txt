To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of getting Jason's description.

First, we'll need to identify the prior probability \( P(A) \), which is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we identify the prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(A^c) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) represents the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the description characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.), it seems more representative of a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(B|A) \) is higher, say 0.9, and \( P(B|A^c) \) for a humanities professor might be lower, say 0.1.

Now, we compute the total probability \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.9643. In the required format:
