To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem combines prior probability and likelihood of the observed data.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)) is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Given the description, we need to estimate the likelihoods of Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(\text{Description} | CS)\)) and a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Description} | H)\)).
   - Since the description mentions interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of computer science professors, we might intuitively assign higher likelihood to \(P(\text{Description} | CS)\). Let's assume:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.8
     \]
   - And for the humanities professors, these traits are less typical, so:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.2
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
    \[
    P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
    \]
   
   Where \(P(\text{Description})\) is the total probability of the description occurring under both hypotheses:
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
    \]
   
    So,
    \[
    P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} = \frac{60}{65} \approx 0.923
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
