To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem formula for this context is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that anyone chosen at random is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(A^c) \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Based on the given description, we need to assume that the probability of this specific description (including being well-liked and highly motivated) is roughly equal for both groups if no specific information indicates otherwise.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor, is similar to \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of this description given Jason is a humanities professor.

If we assume these probabilities are approximately equal (which we will, given the lack of specific distinguishing information in the description), then:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Thus the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) can be simplified to the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
