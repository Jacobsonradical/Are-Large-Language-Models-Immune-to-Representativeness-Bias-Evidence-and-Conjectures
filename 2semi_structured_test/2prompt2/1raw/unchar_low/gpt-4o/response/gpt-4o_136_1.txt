First, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Here's the breakdown:

- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75

We need to calculate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(Desc|CS) \)) and the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(Desc|Hum) \)). 

Since the description gives general traits that could be equally likely for both groups, let's simplify by assuming \( P(Desc|CS) \approx P(Desc|Hum) \).

We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Since \( P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \) and assuming \( P(Desc|CS) \approx P(Desc|Hum) \), these terms cancel out in the ratio. Thus, we only need to compare the prior probabilities directly:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
