To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description fits Jason.

We want to find \( P(CS | D) \). According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors, and 75 humanities professors.
- Hence, the prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Let's assume that the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor as a humanities professor, i.e., \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \). This simplifies the problem because \( P(D) \) can be found as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

If the description likelihoods are equal \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), then:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \]

Hence:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS)} = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
