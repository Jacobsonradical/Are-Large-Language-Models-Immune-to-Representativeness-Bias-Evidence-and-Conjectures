To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason does not provide specific distinguishing details that would favor one group over the other, we can consider the probability \( P(D|CS) \) to be the same as \( P(D|H) \). We will assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Since \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

And because \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), the probabilities \( P(D) \) cancel out under the conditional probability calculation.

Thus, with no further information to adjust these probabilities, the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science is exactly the prior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
