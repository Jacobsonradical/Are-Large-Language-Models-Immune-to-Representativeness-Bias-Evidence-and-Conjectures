To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science (CS) department, \( P(CS) \):
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (H) department, \( P(H) \):
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We assume that the likelihood of generating the description for Jason is approximately equal regardless of whether he is from the CS or humanities department, but since we have no specific data to differentiate, we'll treat the description as neutral.

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) given the description \( D \):
     \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

4. **To simplify the calculation, we note:**
   - \( P(D) \) can be expanded as:
     \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \) because the description is general and applies equally well to professors from both fields, these likelihoods cancel out in the Bayes' formula due to symmetry:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
