To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given that he is described as a successful academic, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Without specific likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we assume that the descriptions are equally likely for computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we assume:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \)

Using the assumption of equal likelihoods,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)} \]
Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \),
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]

Letâ€™s do the calculation:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
