To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's start by defining the given probabilities:

1. **P(CS | Description)**: This is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
2. **P(Description | CS)**: This is the probability that his description matches a computer science professor.
3. **P(CS)**: This is the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor.
4. **P(Humanities | Description)**: This is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor given his description.
5. **P(Description | Humanities)**: This is the probability that his description matches a humanities professor.
6. **P(Humanities)**: This is the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a humanities professor.

The priors can be calculated from the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

So:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For the prior probabilities, the sum of these probabilities must be 1, and they match our sample proportions.

Now, assuming that the descriptions of professors in both fields are equally likely to be any of the valid descriptions, \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Humanities) \) would be identical and cancel out in Bayesian computation. Thus, we don't actually need their exact values, just that they are proportional.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description is proportional to the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

However, since:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]

and assuming equal likelihood for the descriptions, this can be simplified by noting that:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)} \]

So we get:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
