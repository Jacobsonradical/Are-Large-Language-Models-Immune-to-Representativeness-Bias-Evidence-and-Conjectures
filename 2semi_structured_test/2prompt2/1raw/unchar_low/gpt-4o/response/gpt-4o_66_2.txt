To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the given description, we can use Bayes’ Theorem.

Bayes’ Theorem formula is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of randomly picking a computer science professor from the sample.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description (for any professor).

First, let's assign some probabilities:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Since the problem does not specify any difference in traits between computer science and humanities professors, we will assume that the probability of having these traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) is similar across both groups, i.e., \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Then:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \]

Now, placing these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
