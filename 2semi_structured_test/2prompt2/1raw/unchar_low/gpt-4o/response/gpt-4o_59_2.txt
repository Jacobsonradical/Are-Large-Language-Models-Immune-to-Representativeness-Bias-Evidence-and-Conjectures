To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
    - There are 25 computer science professors.
    - There are 75 humanities professors.
    - Total professors: 100

    Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
    - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - The description of Jason is general and doesn’t include specific traits distinguishing between the two groups (like interest in literature or coding). Therefore, in the absence of specific distinguishing traits, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups.

    This means:
    - \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
    - Using Bayes' theorem: 

    \[
    P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
    \]

    Given that \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \):

    \[
    P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
    \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
