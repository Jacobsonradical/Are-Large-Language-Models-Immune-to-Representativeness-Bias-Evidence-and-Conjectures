To determine the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Here's a breakdown of the information provided and the application of Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group, \( P(HUM) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description of Jason does not provide specific traits that can distinctly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors based on the given study details. So, we assume that the likelihood of meeting the description is similar for both groups.

Since the description provided does not significantly favor one group over the other, we will assume that the likelihood, \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | HUM) \), is the same.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Bayes' theorem states that:
     \[
     P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
     \]
   - The term \( P(Description) \) can be expanded as:
     \[
     P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | HUM) \cdot P(HUM)
     \]
   - Given the likelihoods are equal and cancel out, we can simplify poster probability as:
     \[
     P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HUM)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
     \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample remains 0.25 (or 25%).

Here is the formatted answer:

{"probability": "0.25"}
