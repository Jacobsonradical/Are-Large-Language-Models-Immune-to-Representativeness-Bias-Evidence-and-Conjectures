To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on the given evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \) be the evidence (description of Jason).

We are asked to find \( P(C|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor.

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|C) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

For simplicity, we assume that the description provided is equally likely for both groups. That is:
- \( P(E|C) = P(E|H) \)

Since the description is equally likely for both groups, we can assume:
- \( P(E|C) = P(E|H) = k \) (where \( k \) is some constant)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both groups, it can be expressed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the assumed values:
\[ P(E) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = k \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(C|E) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
