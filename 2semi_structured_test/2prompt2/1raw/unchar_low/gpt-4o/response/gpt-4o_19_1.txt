To answer this question, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this context, our hypotheses are:

- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason, we want to calculate the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor, \( P(H_{CS} | D) \), where \( D \) is Jason's description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description across all professors.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, since we do not have explicit data indicating that Jason's description is more or less likely to be associated with either group of professors, we will assume the likelihoods are approximately equal for simplicity:

\[ P(D | H_{CS}) \approx P(D | H_{H}) \]

Therefore, \( P(D) \) can be simplified since it is the weighted average of the two likelihoods by their priors:

\[ P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]

Given the likelihoods are approximately equal, letâ€™s denote them as \( L \):
\[ P(D) = L \cdot 0.25 + L \cdot 0.75 = L \]

So, the posterior probability simplifies to:

\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} = \frac{L \cdot 0.25}{L} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
