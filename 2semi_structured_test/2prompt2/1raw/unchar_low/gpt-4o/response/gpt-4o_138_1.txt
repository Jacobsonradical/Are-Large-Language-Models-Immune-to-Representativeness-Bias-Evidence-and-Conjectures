To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description being that of a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description regardless of the group.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} \) and the prior probability \( P(A^c) \) (not a computer science professor) is \( \frac{75}{100} \).

We assume the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description given the professor is in computer science) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (the probability of the description given the professor is in humanities) are approximately the same since there’s no specific reason to believe the description would be more likely for one group over the other without further information.

Then:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are similar and can be considered the same (let’s call it \( P(B) \)):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{\frac{25}{100}}{\frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100}} = \frac{25}{100} \]

Therefore:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
