To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description overall.

First, let's assign values to these probabilities based on the information given:

1. Prior Probability \( P(A) \):
There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):
There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which represent the likelihood of the description ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation") for computer science and humanities professors, respectively. Given no specific details that distinguish the likelihood between these two groups, we will assume these probabilities are roughly the same:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) = x \]

Given the assumed equal likelihood:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 = x \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
