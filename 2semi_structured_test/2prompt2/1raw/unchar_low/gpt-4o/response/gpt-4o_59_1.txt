In order to calculate your posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates)**:
   - Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   Since no specific information other than general praise of Jason's abilities and reputation is given, we'll assume the likeliness of Jason fitting the description is equally probable among computer science and humanities professors. In other words:
   - \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \)

3. **Normalization**:
   Since \( P(\text{description}) \) is the same for both groups, we can simplify Bayesâ€™ theorem to focus on the prior probabilities.

Given these premises:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, given the limited information that does not differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, the prior odds essentially dominate the posterior probability.

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.25"}} \]
