To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

Firstly, we know:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (the complement of \( A \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Assuming the description of Jason ("high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation") is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, we have:

- The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
- The likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \) that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

Since we assume the description is equally likely for both groups, \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), we denote both by \( k \).

Then, Bayes' theorem simplifies as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
