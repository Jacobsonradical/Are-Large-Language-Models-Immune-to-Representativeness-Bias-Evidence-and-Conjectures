To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step outline of how to do that:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\), is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Similarly, the prior probability of someone being a humanities professor, \(P(H)\), is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We now assume the likelihood of Jason's description being given is equally probable whether he's a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Thus,
     \[
     P(\text{Description} \mid CS) = P(\text{Description} \mid H)
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - As the likelihoods \(P(\text{Description} \mid CS)\) and \(P(\text{Description} \mid H)\) cancel out in this case (assuming they're equal), the posterior probability is directly influenced only by the prior probabilities.

4. **Normalizing Factor**:
   - The total probability of the description, \(P(\text{Description})\), can be expressed as:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
   - Given the assumed equal likelihoods, it simplifies the posterior to be proportional to the prior.

Therefore, the posterior probability \(P(CS \mid \text{Description})\) is essentially the same as the prior probability \(P(CS)\) given our assumptions:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
