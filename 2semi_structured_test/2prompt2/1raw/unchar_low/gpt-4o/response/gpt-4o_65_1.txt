Given the problem context, we can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability. First, let's set up the known probabilities:

1. Prior probability (the probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor):
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. Prior probability (the probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor):
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

Next, we need the likelihoods - the probabilities of observing the given description for each group (computer science and humanities). But since we're not given any specific information that distinguishes between descriptions of CS and humanities professors, we'll assume they are equally likely:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = P(\text{Description})
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Given our assumption:
\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})
\]

This equality results in the posterior probability being equal to the prior probability because the description does not favor either group.
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
