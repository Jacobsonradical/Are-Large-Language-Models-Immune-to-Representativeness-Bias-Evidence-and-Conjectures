Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's define our initial terms:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description under all conditions.

From the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- And, \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \).

We assume that the description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors because there is no specific information suggesting otherwise:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

Since the description makes no additional distinguishing information between the two groups, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) cancel out, making our posterior only dependent on the initial probabilities:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]

Therefore, the posterior probability is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\( \boxed{0.25} \)

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
