To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s the information broken down:

1. Prior Probability:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Specifying the likelihood:
   - We assume that the description given is equally likely for both groups unless specific distinctions indicate otherwise.
   - Here, we do not have additional information to suggest that the personality description given (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) is significantly more prevalent in one group over the other. Hence, we assume:
     - Likelihood of this description given that Jason is a CS professor, \( P(D|CS) \approx 1 \)
     - Likelihood of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \approx 1 \)

3. Calculating Posterior Probability:
   According to Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]

   Since \( P(D|CS) \approx 1 \) and \( P(D|H) \approx 1 \):
   \[
   P(D) = (1 \times 0.25) + (1 \times 0.75) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Given that the descriptive information provided does not favor one group over the other, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains proportional to the base rates.

So, the posterior probability is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
