To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis A given the evidence B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing evidence B given hypothesis A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing evidence B.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided for Jason.

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor (\( P(\neg A) \)).

From the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors is 100.

Therefore:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of observing the description provided for Jason, we need to account for both groups:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Here, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are the probabilities of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. 

Since we are given no additional specific information that would differentiate the description probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we might assume that the probability of observing such a general description is equally likely in both groups. Thus, for simplicity, we can assume:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Since the exact values are not provided, let's assume the provided description is equally likely for any professor in the sample. This removes their influence and simplifies our calculation:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
