To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The prior probabilities and the information given in the problem are crucial for this calculation. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(HU) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | HU) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that the description is of a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that the description is of a humanities professor: \( P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Assuming Equal Likelihood:**
   - Without additional specifics, we assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | HU) \), meaning the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both scenarios, it simplifies to using the prior probabilities directly:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HU)}
          = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}
          = \frac{0.25}{1}
          = 0.25
\]

However, we must normalize it given that P(D) can be neglected as a constant for both groups:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{(P(CS) + P(HU))}
        = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}
        = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

In conclusion, based on the given data and assuming the description's likelihood is equal for both groups, the probability remains as the initial ratio.
