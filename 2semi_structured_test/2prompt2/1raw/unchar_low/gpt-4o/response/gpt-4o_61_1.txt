To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. Prior Probability: This is the initial probability of selecting a computer science professor without any additional information.
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total number of professors = 25 + 75 = 100.

   Therefore, the prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. Complementary Prior Probability: This is the probability of selecting a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. Likelihood: This is where Bayes’ theorem would typically need the probability of observing the given description (Jason’s traits) given the professors’ fields. However, since the description does not provide field-specific traits directly related to computer science or humanities, we’ll use equal likelihood due to limited distinguishing features (we assume it's equally likely that any professor fits the description regardless of their field).

   Thus,
   \[
   P(description|CS) \approx P(description|H) \approx 1
   \]

4. Posterior Probability: Applying Bayes’ theorem, we calculate:
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]

Since we assume \( P(description) \) does not differ significantly between computer science and humanities given equal likelihood, it cancels out. Therefore, our focus returns to the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
   \]

Using the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
