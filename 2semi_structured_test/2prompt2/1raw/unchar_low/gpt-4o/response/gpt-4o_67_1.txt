To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events for our problem:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = The description of Jason we received.
  
We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

We can break this down into the components of Bayes' theorem:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **\( P(\neg A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **\( P(B|A) \)**: The probability that Jason would be described with the given description if he is a computer science professor.
   
   Without specific information differentiating descriptions of computer science and humanities professors, we assume descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Hence:

   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

4. **\( P(B|\neg A) \)**: The probability that Jason would be described with the given description if he is a humanities professor.
   
   As discussed, we assume descriptions are equally likely.

   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]
   
   Let's denote both these probabilities as \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = k \).

5. **\( P(B) \)**: The total probability of receiving the description \( B \).

   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = k \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) \]
   \[ P(B) = k \cdot 1 \]
   \[ P(B) = k \]

Since we are additionally assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), the value of \( k \) cancels out in the numerator and denominator of Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem in this context simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
