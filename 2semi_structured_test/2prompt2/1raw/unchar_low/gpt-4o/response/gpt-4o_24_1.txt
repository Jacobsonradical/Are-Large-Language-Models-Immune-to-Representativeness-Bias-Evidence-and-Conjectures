To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how that would work:

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event of Jason having his specific description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, for simplicity, let's assume that the description provided is equally likely for both computer science professors and humanities professors (this is a simplifying assumption, so in a real-world scenario, you might have additional data to refine these probabilities).

\[ P(B|A) = 1 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Since \( P(B) \) is the same for either group, it's the weighted average of the probabilities given each group:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = (1 \cdot 0.25) + (1 \cdot 0.75) = 1.0 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1.0} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
