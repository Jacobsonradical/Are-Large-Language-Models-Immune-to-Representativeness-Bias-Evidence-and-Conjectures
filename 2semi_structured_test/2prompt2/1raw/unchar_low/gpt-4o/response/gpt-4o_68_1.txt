To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we need to identify all the probabilities involved.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   The number of computer science professors is 25, and the number of humanities professors is 75. Thus, the prior probabilities are:
   \[ P(A_CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(A_Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \ ]

2. **Probability of the Description \( P(B) \)**:
   Since the description is generally positive and could reasonably apply to both groups, we assume it is similarly likely for both. However, without specific probabilities, we'll assume it remains uniform among descriptions.

3. **Probability of the Description Given Each Group \( P(B|A) \)**:
   Similarly, we'll assume the description is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors since nothing specific in the description biases it toward one group. 

Thus:
\[ P(B|A_CS) = P(B|A_Hum) = 1 \] (Assuming equal likelihood for simplicity, which can be refined with more specific data).

Using the simplified Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_CS|B) = \frac{P(B|A_CS) \cdot P(A_CS)}{P(B|A_CS) \cdot P(A_CS) + P(B|A_Hum) \cdot P(A_Hum)} \]
\[ P(A_CS|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A_CS|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A_CS|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ { "probability": "0.25" } \]
