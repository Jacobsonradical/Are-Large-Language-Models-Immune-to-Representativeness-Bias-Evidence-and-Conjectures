To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the following:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) \) = Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group = 25 computer science professors / 100 total professors = 0.25.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group = 75 humanities professors / 100 total professors = 0.75.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Unfortunately, the detailed likelihood \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are not explicitly given. However, given the setup, without additional specific likelihood values, we could apply Bayesian intuition. If we assume \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are not disproportionately different (i.e., descriptions between computer science and humanities professors in this context have no specific bias), the relative sample sizes primarily determine the posterior.

Thus, in this straightforward case:
\[ P(C|D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
