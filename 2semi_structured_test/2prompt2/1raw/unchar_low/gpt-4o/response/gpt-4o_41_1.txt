To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)):
     \( \text{P(CS)} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(H)):
     \( \text{P(H)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  
2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description we have is generic and doesn't give specific evidence that favors computer science over humanities and vice versa. In the absence of specific traits, we'd assume the likelihoods are equal.
   - Probability of having the given description if the professor is from computer science (P(D|CS)) = Probability of having the given description if the professor is from humanities (P(D|H)).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - We are interested in finding P(CS|D), the probability that Jason is from computer science given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{P(CS|D)} = \frac{\text{P(D|CS)} \times \text{P(CS)}}{\text{P(D|CS)} \times \text{P(CS)} + \text{P(D|H)} \times \text{P(H)}} \]

Since P(D|CS) and P(D|H) are equal and cancel each other out:
\[ \text{P(CS|D)} = \frac{\text{P(CS)}}{\text{P(CS)} + \text{P(H)}} \]
\[ \text{P(CS|D)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ \text{P(CS|D)} = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ \text{P(CS|D)} = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
