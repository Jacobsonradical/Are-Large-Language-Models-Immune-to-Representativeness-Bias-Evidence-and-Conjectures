To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of having the description.

We start by defining the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description is fairly generic and does not indicate a strong preference for either computer science or humanities, we'll assume that the description is equally likely for both groups, i.e., (\( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)).

5. \( P(B) \): Total probability of having the description.
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), let's denote \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) as equal, say \( k \).

Then:
\[ P(B) = k \cdot \frac{25}{100} + k \cdot \frac{75}{100} = k \cdot 1 = k \]

Now we can rewrite Bayes' Theorem as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is: 
{"probability": "0.25"}
