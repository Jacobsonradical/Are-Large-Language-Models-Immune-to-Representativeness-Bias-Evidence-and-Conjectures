To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Similarly, \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability of not being a computer science professor, i.e., being a humanities professor) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since no specific information in the description biases towards either computer science or humanities, we assume the same likelihood for the given description under both groups:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Thus, the posterior probability calculation becomes straightforward:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
