To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define our parameters:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(A') \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Since we do not have specific data about how the descriptions vary between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are indistinguishable based on the given description. For simplicity, assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \). In such cases, the posterior probability simplifies to the prior.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is the same as the prior probability.

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = P(\text{Computer Science}) \]

Hence, the posterior probability \( P(\text{Jason is a Computer Science Prof}) = 0.25 \).

So, the answer is:
