To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We want to find \( P(CS \mid D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Now, we assume that the description is equally likely to describe a person from either discipline, making \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \). Given this assumption:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D \mid H) \cdot 0.75 \]

Since \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are equal:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]
where \( k ) is the equal factor (which cancials out of the numerator and denominator).

Now plug back into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the updated posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
