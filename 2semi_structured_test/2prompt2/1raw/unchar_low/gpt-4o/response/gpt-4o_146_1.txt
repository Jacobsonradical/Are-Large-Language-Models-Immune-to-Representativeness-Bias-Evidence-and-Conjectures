To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem:

\[
\text{Posterior} \propto \text{Prior} \times \text{Likelihood}
\]

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability for Jason being a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The problem does not provide specific, distinct likelihood values for the descriptions of computer science vs. humanities professors based only on the given description. The description of Jason being highly capable, motivated, and well-liked is quite general and may not strongly favor either group without additional statistical information.

Since we lack specific information to differentiate the likelihoods, we might initially assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

\[
P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H})
\]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem and assuming equal likelihood, the posterior probability simplifies to the prior probability:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \approx P(\text{CS})
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately the same as the prior:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.25
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
