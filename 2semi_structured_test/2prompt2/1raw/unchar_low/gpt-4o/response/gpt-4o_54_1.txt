To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. We start with the prior probabilities and adjust them based on the evidence provided in the description.

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making up a total of 100 professors.
    - The prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
      \[
      P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
      \]
    - The prior probability (P(H)) that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities is:
      \[
      P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
      \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - Without additional specific information differentiating computer science from humanities professors based on Jason's description, we might assume the likelihood of this description fitting either group could be roughly equal.
    - This means the likelihood (P(Description|CS) and P(Description|H)) might both be equal or assumed to be similar without more specific data differentiating them.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
    - The posterior probability (P(CS|Description)) we want is calculated using Bayes' Theorem:
      \[
      P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
      \]
    - Conversely:
      \[
      P(H|Description) = \frac{P(Description|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(Description)}
      \]
    - Given our assumption about the likelihoods:
      \[
      P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|H)
      \]

    Since \(P(Description)\) is the same irrespective of whether it's from the CS or H group, these likelihoods cancel out, leaving us with:

      \[
      P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
      \]

Given the numbers:
    \[
    P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
    \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
