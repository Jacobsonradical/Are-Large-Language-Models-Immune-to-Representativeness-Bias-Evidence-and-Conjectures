To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science group (CS) is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability (P(H)):** The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities group (H):
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihoods (P(D|CS) and P(D|H)):** These are the probabilities of the description (D) given that the professor is from computer science or humanities. We don't have explicit probabilities for these, but we generally assume these probabilities are similar since we don't have distinguishing information.

   Let's assume the likelihoods for this analysis are equal, so:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability (P(CS|D)):** We use Bayes' Theorem to find the updated probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D):
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Since:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   And assuming \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), the denominator \(P(D)\) simplifies to:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) = P(D|CS)
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS)} = P(CS)
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science group, given the description, is simply the prior probability.

The posterior probability is:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: 0.25
\]

Thus, the answer is: 
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
