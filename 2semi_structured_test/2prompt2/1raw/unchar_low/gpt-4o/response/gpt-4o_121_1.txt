This scenario aligns with the problem known as the base rate fallacy or the prior probability issue. Let's break it down based on the given information:

1. There are 25 professors in computer science.
2. There are 75 professors in the humanities.
3. Making a total of 100 professors.

Without additional information, the prior probabilities are as follows:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description of Jason, it didn't provide any specific details distinguishing computer science from humanities. Therefore, we rely on the prior probabilities.
