To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without any specific information about likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) from the description, we have to assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields since it doesn't provide discipline-specific clues. Hence,
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

Therefore, the formula simplifies significantly:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.25\).

Hence, the answer is:
