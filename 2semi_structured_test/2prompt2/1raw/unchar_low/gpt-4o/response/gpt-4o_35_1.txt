To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula for this scenario is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description (regardless of whether Jason is in computer science or humanities).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (not \( A \)), \( P(\neg A) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We assume that the descriptions are equally likely to apply to both groups of professors because the description given does not provide specific evidence favoring one field over the other. Thus:
- \( P(B|A) \) = \( P(B|\neg A) \)

Because of the assumption of equal likelihood and the fact that there are more humanities professors, the overall probability of the description, \( P(B) \), can be expressed as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.75 \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let's call this common probability \( P(B|Description) \). Then:

\[ P(B) = P(B|Description) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(B|Description) \cdot 1 = P(B|Description) \]

Substituting into Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|Description) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|Description)} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
