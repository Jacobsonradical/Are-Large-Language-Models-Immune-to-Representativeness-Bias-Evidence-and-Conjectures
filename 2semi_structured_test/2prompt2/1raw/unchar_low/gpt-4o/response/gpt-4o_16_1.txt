To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's note the relevant numbers:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (Humanities).

The base probabilities (priors) are:
- The prior probability that Jason is a CS professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability that Jason is a Humanities professor: \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Let’s denote the evidence as \( E \), which matches Jason's description. We're interested in \( P(CS|E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given the evidence.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|CS) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \( P(E|Humanities) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a Humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence, regardless of the category.

To apply Bayes’ Theorem, we need the likelihoods, \( P(E|CS) \) and \( P(E|Humanities) \). Without specific information about how different traits align with being in CS or Humanities, we'll often assume that Jason's description is equally likely for both groups for simplicity:

\( P(E|CS) = P(E|Humanities) \)

Then:
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]

Since \( P(E|CS) = P(E|Humanities) \), these cancel out in the numerator and denominator of Bayes' formula, and the posterior probability simplifies to the priors:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[ \boxed{\text{{"probability": "0.25"}}} \]
