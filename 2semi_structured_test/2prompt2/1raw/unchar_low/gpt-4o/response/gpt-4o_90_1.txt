To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We know the following prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description \( D \) doesn't provide specific details unique to either profession directly, so we need to assume that the description could apply equally to both computer science and humanities professors:
- \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \)

Given that \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately the same, the posterior probability will mainly depend on the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \).

Thus, using Bayes' theorem and the fact that \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Plugging in the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
