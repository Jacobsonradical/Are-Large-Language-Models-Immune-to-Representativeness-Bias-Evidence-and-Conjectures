To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, we need to determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - Thus, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, letâ€™s consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). 

Without additional information, we assume that the description given (Jason's profile) is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors. That is to say:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

In such a case:
- \( P(B) =  P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 = x \).

Since \( x \) appears as a constant, it becomes irrelevant for the comparative posterior probability.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus the posterior probability remains equal to the prior probability due to the symmetrically distributed likelihood of the description:
