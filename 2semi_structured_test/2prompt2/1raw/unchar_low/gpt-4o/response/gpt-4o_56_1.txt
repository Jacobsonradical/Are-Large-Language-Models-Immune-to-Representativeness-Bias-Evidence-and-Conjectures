To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from computer science, which is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jason's description.

We start by finding the prior probability \( P(A) \).
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, letâ€™s assume that the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equivalent because the description does not give any significant evidence that distinguishes between computer science professors and humanities professors. Thus, \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \).

Then we can reason that:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), we simplify this to:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore, using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25, which corresponds to the prior probability due to the lack of additional distinguishing information in the description given.
