To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the given probabilities:

1. **Prior probability of being a CS professor (\( P(CS) \)):**
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)):**
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

Now, let \( D \) represent the description that was given for Jason. We need the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \), which represent the probabilities of drawing such a description given that Jason is a CS professor or a humanities professor, respectively. However, since we were not provided with these specific likelihoods, we can assume that the likelihood of getting a description like Jason's is equally probable among CS and humanities professors. This is reflected in Bayesian calculations that assume a similar distribution of descriptions unless there are specific distinctive features described that would lean heavily towards CS or Humanities.

Assuming \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \), their ratio effectively cancels out:

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \) and given \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | CS) \cdot P(Hum) = P(D | CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum))
\]

Bayes' theorem thus simplifies to:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
