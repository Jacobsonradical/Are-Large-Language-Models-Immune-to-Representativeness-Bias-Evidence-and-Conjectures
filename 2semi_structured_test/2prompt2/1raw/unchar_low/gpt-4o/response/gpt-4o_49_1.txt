To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) = the description of Jason

We are given:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability that a professor is from computer science)
- \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \) (probability that a professor is from the humanities)

We need to calculate:
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)

Since we don't have specific details regarding how likely the description fits computer science vs. humanities professors (since the description seems quite general and can fit any discipline equally), we can reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \). Hence, both \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) can be considered approximately equal.

In such a case:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \approx P(B|A) \]
(seing that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are approximately equal).

Given everything is roughly equal, we have:
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = P(A) \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is about 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
