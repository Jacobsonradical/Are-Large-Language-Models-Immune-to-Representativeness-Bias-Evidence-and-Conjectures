To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

To use this formula, we also need the following:
1. The prior probability \(P(C)\), which is the probability of selecting a computer science professor without any additional information.
2. The prior probability \(P(H)\), which is the probability of selecting a humanities professor without any additional information.
3. The probability of the description given the hypotheses, \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\).

First, we calculate the priors:
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.
- Therefore, \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) and \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now, because we don't have specific information to indicate that Jason's description is more likely to be of a computer science professor than a humanities professor or vice versa, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Hence, \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\).

Since the description's likelihood \(P(D)\) can be decomposed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are equal and can be considered as some constant \(k\), we get:
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k(0.25 + 0.75) = k \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
