To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's represent the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): The probability of the description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:

- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

So,

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that we do not have specific information to differentiate between the likelihood that the description fits either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Hence,

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

For simplicity, let's denote this common value as \( k \).

Now,

\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Plugging these back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
