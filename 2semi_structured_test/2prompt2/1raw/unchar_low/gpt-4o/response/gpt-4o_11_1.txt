To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Given:
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the description given computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) = Probability of the description given humanities professor.
- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of being a humanities professor.

Let's define:
- \( H \): Humanities professor
- \( CS \): Computer science professor

Since descriptions were chosen at random from 100 descriptions:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming the description does not provide specific enough information to differentiate between the two groups (i.e., \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are similar), we can simplify the calculations. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \):

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Moreover,
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \), let's call it \( P(D | Prof) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | Prof)(P(CS) + P(H)) = P(D | Prof) \cdot 1 \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | Prof) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | Prof)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).

The answer is:
```
{"probability": "0.25"}
