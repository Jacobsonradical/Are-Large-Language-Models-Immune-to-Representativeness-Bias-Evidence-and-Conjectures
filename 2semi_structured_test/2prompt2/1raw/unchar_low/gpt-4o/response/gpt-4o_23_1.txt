To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the prior probability and the likelihood of his description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, let's establish the prior probability based on the sample sizes:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we do not have specific data on how likely each description is for computer science versus humanities professors, we'll assume that the provided description is equally likely for both groups. This means the likelihood is equally distributed among the groups.

Given that Jason's description fits both groups similarly, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probabilities. Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
