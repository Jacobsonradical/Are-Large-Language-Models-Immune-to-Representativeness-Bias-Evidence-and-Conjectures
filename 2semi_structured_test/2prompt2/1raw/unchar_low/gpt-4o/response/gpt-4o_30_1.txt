To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update prior probabilities given new evidence. 

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now let's denote \( E \) as the event that the description provided matches Jason.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS} \mid E) \), which is the probability that Jason is from computer science given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the event \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

If we assume that the likelihood \( P(E \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(E \mid \text{Humanities}) \) are about the same based on the description (high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked, all of which could be seen as equally likely traits in both computer science and humanities professors), then:

\[ P(E \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(E \mid \text{Humanities}) \]

Therefore, the terms could potentially cancel each other out, implying:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid E) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, JSON format for the answer:
\[ \{"probability": "0.25"\} \]
