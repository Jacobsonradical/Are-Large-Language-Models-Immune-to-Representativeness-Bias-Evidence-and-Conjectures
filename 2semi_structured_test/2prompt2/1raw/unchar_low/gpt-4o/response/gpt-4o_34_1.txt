To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving it:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors:
      \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is the ratio of humanities professors to the total:
      \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - Without any additional information distinguishing the personality traits between the two groups (assuming the descriptions could equally apply to both groups), we assume the likelihood of this description given either group is equal:
      \(P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)\)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
    Bayes' theorem states:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]
    similarly,
    \[
    P(Hum|D) = \frac{P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(D)}
    \]

    Since the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|Hum)\) are equal, we can denote \(P(D)\) as the total probability of the description regardless of group. Thus:
    \[
    P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
    \]
    Given that \(P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum)\), let's call this common likelihood \(L\). Therefore:
    \[
    P(D) = L \cdot P(CS) + L \cdot P(Hum) = L(P(CS) + P(Hum)) = L(0.25 + 0.75) = L
    \]

    Inserting these into Bayes' theorem:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{L \cdot 0.25}{L} = 0.25
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
