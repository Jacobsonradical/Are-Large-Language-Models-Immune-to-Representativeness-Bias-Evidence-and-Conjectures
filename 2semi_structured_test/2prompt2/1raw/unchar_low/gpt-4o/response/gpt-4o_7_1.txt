To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (let's denote this as \( C \)), we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the problem, we start with the following information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(C) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \), where H is the event that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

If we assume that the likelihood of the given description being chosen is equally distributed between computer science and humanities professors, \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). Thus:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that descriptions are equally likely between the two groups:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Let's denote this common probability as \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = k \).

Then:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]

Substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

So, simplifying:

\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore,
