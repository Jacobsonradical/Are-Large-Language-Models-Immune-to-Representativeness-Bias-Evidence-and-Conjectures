To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood of the description given each profession.

1. **Prior probabilities**: 
    - Computer Science professors (CS): \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
    - Humanities professors (HU): \[ P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
    We assume it's equally likely for the description to apply to CS or HU professors without specific data suggesting otherwise. Therefore:
    - Likelihood of the description given a CS professor \[ P(D \mid CS) = 1 \]
    - Likelihood of the description given a HU professor \[ P(D \mid HU) = 1 \]

3. **Posterior probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
    \[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

4. **Calculation of normalizing factor**:
    \[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
    \[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

5. **Final posterior probability**:
    \[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```

Bayes' theorem essentially tells us that, given an equally likely description, we should rely on the base rates. Since the description doesnâ€™t provide additional differentiating information, the posterior remains the same as the prior.
