To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS) in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

For this problem:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is from the CS group: \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The complementary prior probability that Jason is from the humanities group \( P(\neg A) \): \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We assume that the personality descriptions are equally likely to describe someone from either the CS group or the humanities group. Thus, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are approximately equal.

Since \( P(B) \) is simply a normalization factor to ensure the probabilities sum to 1 and doesn't affect the ratio, it simplifies the calculation.

Thus, based on Bayes' theorem in the context where \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are comparably likely, the probability we are asked for is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

So,
