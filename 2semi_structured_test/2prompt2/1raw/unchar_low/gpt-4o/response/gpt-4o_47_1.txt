To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

We can use the following variables:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor
- \( P(B) \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor
- \( P(D | A) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science
- \( P(D | B) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities
- \( P(A | D) \): Posterior probability of being a computer science professor given the description

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming no additional information differentiating between the descriptions given for computer science and humanities professors, we consider the descriptions equally likely for both fields (i.e., \( P(D | A) = P(D | B) \)).

Applying Bayes' Theorem simplifies to considering the priors alone:
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
