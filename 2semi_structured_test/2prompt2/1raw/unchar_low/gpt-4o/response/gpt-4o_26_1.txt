To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The event that the description given fits Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
     \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We assume that the description could equally describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor, as the information provided is broad and not domain-specific.

   Therefore:
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   This is the weighted sum of the likelihoods:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), and denoting this common probability as \( P(B|common) \), we can simplify:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|common) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = P(B|common) \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), they cancel out in the Bayes' formula:

   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

   Simplifying:

   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{1} = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
