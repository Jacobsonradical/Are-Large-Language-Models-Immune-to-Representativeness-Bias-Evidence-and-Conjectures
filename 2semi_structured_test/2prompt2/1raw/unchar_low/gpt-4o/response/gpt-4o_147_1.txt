To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

From the problem:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.

Prior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, we need to estimate how likely such a description is for professors in both fields. Assuming that this particular description does not provide a significant basis to distinguish between computer science and humanities professors (i.e., it's equally likely for both):

\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \]

Since the description does not favor either field, it's reasonable to assume:
\[ P(\text{Description}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times 0.25 + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \times 0.75 \]

Given the assumption that the description is equally likely for both fields (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \)):

\[ P(\text{Description}) \]

Thus, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore:

\[ {\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
