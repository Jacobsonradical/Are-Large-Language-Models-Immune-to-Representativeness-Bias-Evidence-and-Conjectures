To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, we need to determine our prior probabilities:

\[
P(A_{CS}) = \text{probability that Jason is a computer science professor} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(A_{H}) = \text{probability that Jason is a humanities professor} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \):

- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) = the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) = the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Given the prompt, we don't have direct information about the specific likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \). However, without additional information suggesting otherwise, we might reasonably assume that the likelihoods are the same for now, thus approximating both as equal.

Thus, both likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) cancel out in the equation simplifying our calculation to:

\[
P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
