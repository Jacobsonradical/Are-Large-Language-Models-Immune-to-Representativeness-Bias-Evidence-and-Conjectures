To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can first simplify \( P(\text{Description}) \) as follows, using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

In this problem, without any extra information about the specific likelihoods (i.e., \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)), we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups because nothing in the description given points to a specific field.

Thus, we have:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \), these probabilities effectively cancel each other out in the posterior calculation.

Therefore,

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{1.0} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
