To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which will help us update our prior beliefs about Jason based on the new information given.

First, let's denote the following:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Given that Jason could be from either group, these are:
  - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description, given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): The probability of Jason's description, given that he is a humanities professor.

Since we are not given specific information that differentiates these likelihoods and the description seems to apply equally well to both groups, we initially assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \)

Under this assumption, Bayes' theorem simplifies to just the prior probabilities:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) are assumed equal, and \( P(D) \) is the same for either group, we effectively compare the priors directly:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
\]

Given \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = P(CS)
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(CS|D) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{
"probability": "0.25"
\}
