To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( H_{CS} \) as the hypothesis that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H_{H} \) as the hypothesis that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( E \) as the evidence described about Jason.

We know:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability for computer science professors)
- \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability for humanities professors)

Bayes' theorem tells us how to update these probabilities based on new evidence:

\[
P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E)}
\]

\[
P(H_{H} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{H}) P(H_{H})}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \):

\[
P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{H}) P(H_{H})
\]

The issue here is that the description of Jason doesn't give us specific details that would allow us to estimate \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{H}) \) differently. So, we'll assume that the evidence is equally likely given either hypothesis. That is:

\[
P(E | H_{CS}) = P(E | H_{H})
\]

Thus, the posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor simplifies to the prior probability, because the evidence does not favor one hypothesis over the other.

So,

\[
P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{P(H_{CS})}{P(H_{CS}) + P(H_{H})} P(E | H_{CS}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability remains 0.25.
