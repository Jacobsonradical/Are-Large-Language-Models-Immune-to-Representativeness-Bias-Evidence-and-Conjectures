Given the background information and the setup, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**: Initially, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
    - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: For translation purposes, we'll assume that the likelihood of any professor (regardless of discipline) fitting the given description is roughly similar. This means \( P(Description|CS) \) and \( P(Description|Humanities) \) are considered equal.
    - Let \( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Humanities) \).

3. **Marginal Probability**: Since we are choosing one description from the 100 available descriptions:
    - \( P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \)

4. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem,
    \[
    P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
    \]

Since \( P(Description|CS) \) and \( P(Description|Humanities) \) are equal, they cancel out:
    \[
    P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Humanities)}
    = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}
    = \frac{0.25}{1}
    = 0.25
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
``` 

This analysis hinges on the assumption that the provided details in the descriptions have no discriminatory power between the two groups.
