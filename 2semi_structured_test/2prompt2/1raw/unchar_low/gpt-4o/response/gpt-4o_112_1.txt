To determine the posterior probability, I’ll apply Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence under all hypotheses.

For this problem:
- \( H \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( E \) is the description of Jason.

Let’s denote:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, and similarly, for humanities.
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \).

Given that we don't have additional details making Jason's description more likely for either group and assuming the description is equally common across both groups (as no specific details favor one over the other):

\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \]

Let's assume these probabilities are equal:

\[ P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \]

Since they are equal:

\[ P(E) = P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Thus:

\[ P(E) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.25 + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot 0.75 \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \):

\[ P(E) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \]

Now by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \):

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{1} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) \]

Thus:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
