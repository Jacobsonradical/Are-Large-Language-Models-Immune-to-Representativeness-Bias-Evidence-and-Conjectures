To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(\text{Hum}) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description of Jason doesn't provide specific traits particularly indicative of being in computer science or humanities. Assuming the likelihood of such qualities (high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and enjoying a positive reputation) is roughly similar in both fields, we consider them equal. Letâ€™s denote this likelihood as \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{Hum}) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), which can be expanded as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
   \]
   Given that \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{Hum}) \):
   \[
   P(D) \approx P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|\text{Hum}) \cdot 0.75
   \]
   Since \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{Hum}) \):
   \[
   P(D) \approx P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 1 = P(D|\text{CS})
   \]

   Using equal likelihoods both \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(D|\text{Hum}) \):
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.25}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.25 \cdot P(D|\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = 0.25 \cdot \left( \frac{P(D|\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS})} \right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = 0.25
   \]

Given the equal likelihood of the description fitting either group and the prior probability, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
