To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

We are looking to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(\text{Description}) } \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities)
- The description is random from any of the 100 professors.

Since the description does not provide specific information strongly favoring CS or humanities, we can reasonably assume \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) are not significantly different from each other given the limited information available in the description.

Thus, we can simplify using the information about the base rates:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
