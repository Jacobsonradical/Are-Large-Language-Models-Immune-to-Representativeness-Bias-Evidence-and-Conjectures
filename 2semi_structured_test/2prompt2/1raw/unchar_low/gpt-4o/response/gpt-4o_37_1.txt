Sure, let's go through this step by step.

First, let's note the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- Probability that a professor is from Computer Science (CS), P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that a professor is from the Humanities, P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given that we have the description of Jason, we need to determine the likelihood of his profile fitting with a CS professor or a Humanities professor. However, from the description alone ("Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children. He is known for his high ability and strong motivation. Well-liked by his colleagues, Jason enjoys a positive reputation in his professional environment."), there aren't any distinguishing characteristics that clearly favor either group.

Therefore, we must primarily rely on the prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Given that the description does not provide anything particularly favoring one group over the other, we can assume \( P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|H) \). Thus, the posterior probability \( P(CS|Description) \) is essentially the same as the prior probability \( P(CS) \).

So:

\[ P(CS|Description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Our answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
