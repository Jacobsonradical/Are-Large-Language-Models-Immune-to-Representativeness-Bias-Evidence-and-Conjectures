Given the problem setup, we start with the base rates of the two groups of professors:

- Computer Science Professors: 25 out of 100 (25%)
- Humanities Professors: 75 out of 100 (75%)

This implies a prior probability that any randomly chosen description corresponds to a computer science professor of 0.25 and to a humanities professor of 0.75.

The description of Jason does not provide specific information linking directly to either discipline. It mentions traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-likedâ€”all of which are features that could be common to successful academics in both computer science and the humanities.

In the absence of specific distinguishing information in the description that would sway us towards one group, we rely on the base rate probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given this description, should remain close to the initial base rate due to the lack of additional differential evidence.

The posterior probability calculation remains the same:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \text{Base Rate}_{\text{Computer Science}} = 0.25 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
