To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description of Jason.

First, let's define the given probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):**
   Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
   
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   Without specific data about the likelihoods, letâ€™s assume the description could apply equally to professors from both fields*:
   
   \[
   P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A)
   \]

3. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \):**
   
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \):
   
   \[
   P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A))
   \]
   \[
   P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot 1
   \]
   \[
   P(B) \approx P(B|A)
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability, \( P(A|B) \):**

\[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   
Since \( P(B) \approx P(B|A) \):

\[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{1} = P(A)
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[
   {"probability": "0.25"}
   \]

***Note:** Assuming equal likelihood in this situation is a simplification due to the absence of specific data about how likely the description is for each field. The result should be updated if additional information about differential likelihoods becomes available.
