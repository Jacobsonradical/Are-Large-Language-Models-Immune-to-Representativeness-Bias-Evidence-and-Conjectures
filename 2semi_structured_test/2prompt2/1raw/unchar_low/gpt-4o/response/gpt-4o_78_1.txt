To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and any information in the description that might update those probabilities (likelihoods).

Since the description provided doesn't seem to give any explicit indications that favor either computer science or humanities, we mainly rely on the base rates. 

The base rates are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

This gives us the prior probabilities:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/(25+75) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = 75/(25+75) = 75/100 = 0.75

Since the description of Jason doesn't provide any specific information that discriminates between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we do not have any additional likelihoods to adjust these priors. Thus, our posterior probability remains the same as the prior probability:

Given these considerations, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
