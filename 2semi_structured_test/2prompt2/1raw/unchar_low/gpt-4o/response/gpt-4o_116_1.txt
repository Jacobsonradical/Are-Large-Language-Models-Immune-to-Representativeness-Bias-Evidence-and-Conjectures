To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and B be the event that we receive the given description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of receiving the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of receiving the description.

Given the setup of the study:

- There are 25 tenured computer science professors and 75 tenured humanities professors.
- Without any specific information from the descriptions themselves, we assume that the descriptions are equally likely to describe either a computer science or a humanities professor.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) (where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor) is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \). Without additional specifics about the likelihoods, we'll assume that receiving the particular description of Jason is equally likely for both groups. Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Since we have no reason to believe that one group is more likely to produce the description than the other:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

Using the law of total probability, \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Given our assumption:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A^c) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.25"} \]
