To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description among all professors.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors (\( A \)): 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior probability \( P(B|A) \):
Since the description is randomly chosen and doesn't provide specific information biased towards any discipline, we can assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{humanities professor}) \).

\[ P(B|A) \) is assumed to be roughly the same for both disciplines, say \( P(B|A) = k \), where \( k \) is some non-zero constant.
\[ P(B|\text{humanities professor}) = k \]

Thus, the prior probabilities are proportional to the number of professors in each discipline.

Probability \( P(B) \) (total probability of the description):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{humanities professor}) \cdot P(\text{humanities professor}) \]
\[ = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ = k \cdot 1 \]
\[ = k \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
