Based on the given information and using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's consider the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors, so the prior probability of being a computer science professor is \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- There are 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability of being a humanities professor is \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Given the description of Jason, without specific features that are strongly indicative of either computer science or humanities, we assume the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) is similar to the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)). Hence, for simplicity, we assume \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), leading to the posterior probability being influenced mainly by the prior probabilities.

Thus, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}\]

Since \(P(D|CS)\) roughly equals \(P(D|H)\):

\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}\]
\[\approx \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}\]
\[\approx \frac{0.25}{1}\]
\[\approx 0.25\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
