To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(\text{H})\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - These are probabilities that any given description would fit a computer science professor (\(P(\text{D}|\text{CS})\)) or a humanities professor (\(P(\text{D}|\text{H})\)).
   - Without specific details suggesting that Jason is more likely to fit into one group than the other, we can assume the likelihood \(P(\text{D}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{D}|\text{H}) = 1\) (equally likely).
   
3. **Posterior Probability:**
   By Bayes' Theorem,
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{D}) = \frac{P(\text{D}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{D})}
   \]
   Since \(P(\text{D})\) is the same in both the numerator and the equationâ€™s denominator (and assuming it's equally likely to describe either group as stated, \(P(\text{D}) = 1\)), it cancels out in the calculation, simplifying to:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{D}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
