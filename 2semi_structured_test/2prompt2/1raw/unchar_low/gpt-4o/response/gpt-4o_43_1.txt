To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to consider the prior probabilities and then adjust them based on the given information. We'll use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Since the description of Jason ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation") does not favor one group disproportionately over the other, we can assume that the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are approximately equal.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Since \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), these terms cancel out in Bayes' theorem, simplifying to:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
     \]
   - Rearranging and assuming equal likelihoods:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
     \]

Given the assumptions made and the uniformity in description, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.25" \]
