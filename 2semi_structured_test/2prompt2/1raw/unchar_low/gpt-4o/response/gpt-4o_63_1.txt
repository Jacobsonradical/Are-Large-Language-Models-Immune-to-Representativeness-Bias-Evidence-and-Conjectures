To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the given description if the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the given description if the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) be the posterior probability that a professor is a computer science professor given the description.

From the given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Thus:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since Jason's description does not provide specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume that \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are the same, making \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \). Therefore, these probabilities cancel out in Bayes' theorem.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)}
\]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
