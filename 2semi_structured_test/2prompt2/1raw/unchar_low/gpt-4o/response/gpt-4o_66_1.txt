To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can employ Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To complete our Bayesian analysis, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): We assume that the description does not favor either group specifically. Thus, we can consider \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \).

Without any bias in favor of computer science or humanities based on the description, we assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \]
This indicates the description is equally likely regardless of the group.

Since both descriptions are equally likely, we can rely primarily on the prior probabilities for \( A \) and \( A' \).

Thus using the priors:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]
because \( P(B) \) normalizes the result but doesn't affect the ratio when the likelihood is the same for both conditions.

So, the posterior probability Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.25" \]
