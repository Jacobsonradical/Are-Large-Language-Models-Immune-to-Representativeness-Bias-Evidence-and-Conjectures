To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Here’s how we can approach this problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with prior probabilities:**
    - The overall probability of selecting a computer science professor (CSP) is 25 out of 100, which is 0.25.
    - The overall probability of selecting a humanities professor (HP) is 75 out of 100, which is 0.75.

2. **Evaluate likelihoods:**
    - The description of Jason doesn’t provide specific information that strongly distinguishes between a CS professor and a humanities professor. Thus, we might assume that the likelihood of this description is roughly equal for both groups. For simplicity, let’s assume the likelihood of a CS professor having Jason's description and the likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason's description are the same, which is \( P(Description | CSP) = P(Description | HP) \).

Given that the likelihoods are equal, Bayes' theorem simplifies in this context. The posterior probability is then solely influenced by the prior probabilities.

3. **Update with Bayes' theorem:**
    \[
    P(CSP | Description) = \frac{P(CSP) \cdot P(Description | CSP)}{P(CSP) \cdot P(Description | CSP) + P(HP) \cdot P(Description | HP)}
    \]

Since \( P(Description | CSP) = P(Description | HP) \), they cancel out:

\[
P(CSP | Description) = \frac{P(CSP)}{P(CSP) + P(HP)}
\]

Inserting the prior probabilities:

\[
P(CSP | Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Accordingly, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25. 

Here is the final answer formatted as requested:

\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
