To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event described in the description (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation).

We are given:
- \( P(C) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|C) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's start with the base rates:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since 75 out of 100 professors are from humanities)

Assuming that the description \( D \) of being high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors (since the description does not provide specific information that biases it towards one field):

- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1 \)

Given this assumption, Bayes' Theorem simplifies the calculation:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups, it cancels out in the relative comparison, thus:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25. 

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
