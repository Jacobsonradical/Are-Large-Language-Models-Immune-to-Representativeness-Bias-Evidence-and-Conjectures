To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) and the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)). However, since the description given doesn't provide any specific traits strongly indicative of either field, we assume both likelihoods are roughly equal (based on the assumption the personality traits described can be equally likely in both fields).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Assuming \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\), they cancel out:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the same as the prior probability:
