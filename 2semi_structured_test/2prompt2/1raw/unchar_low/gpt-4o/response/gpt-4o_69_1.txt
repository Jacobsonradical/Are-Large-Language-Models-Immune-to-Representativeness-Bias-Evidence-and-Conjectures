To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the information provided:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description does not favor one discipline over the other, we can reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor) is the same as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, and both would be close to equal.

Given this symmetry,

\[ \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability Jason is a humanities professor.

Given equal likelihood for the description across groups, 
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|H) \]

Substitute values:
\[ \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p \cdot 0.25 + p \cdot 0.75} = 0.25 \\
P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:
