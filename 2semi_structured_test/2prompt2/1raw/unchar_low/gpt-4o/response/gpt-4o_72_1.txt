To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the reasoned calculation:

We have the following information:
- 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
- Therefore, a total of 100 professors.

We are asked to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- C as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- H as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- D as the description given about Jason.

We need to find P(C|D), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description D.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We also know:
- P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25 (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor).
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor).

Assuming that the descriptions are equally likely for both groups given that they are all tenured and successful professors:

\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

We apply this equivalence under the assumption that the provided description does not inherently favor one group over the other:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Since P(D|C) â‰ˆ P(D|H):

\[ P(D) = P(D|H) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|H) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D|H) = P(D|C) \]

So:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C)} \cdot \frac{1}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
Since this equals the prior probability P(C):

\[ P(C|D) = P(C) \]

Hence:
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
