To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the relevant information:

- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science (CS).
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities (H).
- The description is chosen at random from these 100 professors.

Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given that we have no additional information from the description provided that would differentiate between disciplines, we can assume that the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)) is the same as the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \)).

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description was chosen at random, the likelihood of selecting any specific professor's description is uniform. Therefore, the denominator, \( P(\text{Description}) \), is unified across all 100 professors.

The adjusted equation simplifies to:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} \]

Substituting values:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
