To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step approach to determine this probability:

1. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) is:
     \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(\text{H}) \)) is:
     \[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. Estimate the likelihoods:
   - Assume that the description given (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally likely for both disciplines, though we do not have any specific information favoring one discipline over the other. Therefore, the likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is from computer science (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)) and given that he is from the humanities (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \)) are both approximately equal.

3. Use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:
   \[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is a normalizing constant and the likelihoods are assumed to be equal, it cancels out in the calculation:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
