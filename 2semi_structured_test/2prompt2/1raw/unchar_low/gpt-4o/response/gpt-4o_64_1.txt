To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The event that Jason fits the given description.

We want to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the proportions in the initial sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The complementary probability, \( P(A^c) \) (that Jason is a humanities professor), is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description is equally likely for both groups (no additional specific details suggesting otherwise):
- \( P(B|A) \) = \( P(B|A^c) \).

Therefore, \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description, is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), we simplify to:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

So, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) \]
Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
