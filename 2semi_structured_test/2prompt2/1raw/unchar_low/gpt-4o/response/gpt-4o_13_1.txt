To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is in computer science given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's apply the given data:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors:
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given the fields. Since we have no specific data that differentiates the description of professors in the two fields, we assume there is no bias:
   \[
   P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A)
   \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are assumed equal and the description is chosen randomly without further bias within each field, we can estimate the probability of the description \( P(B) \) as a uniform distribution over both fields.

Thus, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to using the prior probabilities directly because \( P(B) \) cancels out:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)}
\]

Therefore,

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1.00}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = 0.25
\]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25. Here is the answer in the requested format:
