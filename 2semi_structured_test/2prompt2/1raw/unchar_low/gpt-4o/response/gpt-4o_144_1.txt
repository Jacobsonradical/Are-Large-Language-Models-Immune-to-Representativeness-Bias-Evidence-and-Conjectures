To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence.

Given the problem statement, we have:
- \( P(CS) = \) prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science field.
- \( P(Hum) = \) prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities field.

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, letâ€™s define the hypothesis:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{Hum} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(H_{CS} \mid E) \) where \( E \) is the given description. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

We assume, in absence of specific distinguishing features or explicit indicators differentiating between the computer science and humanities professors in the description, that \( P(E \mid H_{CS}) = P(E \mid H_{Hum}) \). Therefore, the evidence \( E \) is equally likely given either hypothesis. As such, this simplifies to:

\[ P(H_{CS} \mid E) = \frac{P(H_{CS})}{P(H_{CS}) + P(H_{Hum})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, based on the prior probabilities and the non-differentiating nature of the description provided, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
