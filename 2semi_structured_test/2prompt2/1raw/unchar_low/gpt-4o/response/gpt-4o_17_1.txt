To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this context, we will define the events as follows:

- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(A) \)) is:
  
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(A^c) \)) is:
  
  \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the description does not heavily favor one field over the other, we can assume that the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) will be equal, as the description fits an individual who could reasonably be in either field.

Thus:

  \[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Since we are looking for \( P(A|B) \), we consider the total probability of \( B \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(B|A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(A^c) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) (P(A) + P(A^c)) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) (0.25 + 0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore, by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B) = P(B|A) \), the expression simplifies:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
