To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence. In this case, the prior probability and the likelihood of the data given each group are used to calculate the posterior probability.

We'll define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) : Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (prior probability)
- \( P(H) \) : Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (prior probability)
- \( P(D|CS) \) : Probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor
- \( P(D|H) \) : Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor

Given:
- Total professors = 100 (25 CS and 75 Humanities)
- Prior probability for Jason being a CS professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability for Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The problem does not provide specific \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) values, so we'll assume they are equal since the description is fairly generic and could reasonably apply to both groups. If \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), which is common in such neutral descriptions, the likelihood terms cancel out.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Substituting, we get:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.75} \]

If \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), letâ€™s call that value \( P(D|*) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|*) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|*) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75)} = \frac{0.25}{1} \]

Therefore:

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description provided, is:
