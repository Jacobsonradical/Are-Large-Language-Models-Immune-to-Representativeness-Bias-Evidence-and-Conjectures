To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We know:
- \( P(C) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75

We are given a description of Jason, and we need to determine:
- \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).

To use Bayes' theorem, we also need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively. These probabilities are a bit trickier to determine without explicit information. 

However, assuming the description is equally likely to fit both a computer science professor and a humanities professor (since nothing in the description specifically biases one discipline over the other), we can assume:
- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)

Since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal, they cancel out in Bayes' theorem, leading to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C) P(D|C)}{P(C) P(D|C) + P(H) P(D|H)} \]

We simplify this to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
