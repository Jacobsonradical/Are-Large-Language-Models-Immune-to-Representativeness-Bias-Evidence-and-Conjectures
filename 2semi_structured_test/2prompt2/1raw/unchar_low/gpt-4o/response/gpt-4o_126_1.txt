Given the problem setup and the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)): 25 out of 100, so 0.25.
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)): 75 out of 100, so 0.75.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor})\)
   - \(P(\text{Description} | \text{H Professor})\)

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since the precise likelihoods (\(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor})\) and \(P(\text{Description} | \text{H Professor})\)) are not provided, we have to simplify:
   \[
   P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H Professor}) \cdot P(\text{H Professor})}
   \]

4. **Assumption**:
   Without specific details that would distinguish likelihoods given the description, we might assume the description is equally likely for both CS and Humanities professors. So,
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H Professor})
   \]

   Based on this assumption:
   \[
   P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

### Conclusion:
Given this setup and the assumption that the description doesn't favor one group over the other in terms of likelihood, the posterior probability is the same as the prior probability.

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}}
\]
