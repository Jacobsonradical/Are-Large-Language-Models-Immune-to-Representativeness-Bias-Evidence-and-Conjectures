To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- Total number of professors (P): 100
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75

The base rate or prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate or prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We have a description of Jason that mentions characteristics like being male, married, high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and having a positive reputation. These traits are relatively general and do not clearly favor one discipline over the other without additional specific information. Given this, we might not have additional evidence to strongly favor either category based on the description alone.

With the absence of additional evidence favoring one group and treating the description as equally likely for both groups, our "likelihood" for both groups would be equal. That is:
\[ P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{H}) \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability can be found using:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) normalizes the probabilities and the likelihoods provide no additional weight (as they are equal), the posterior probabilities should match the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
