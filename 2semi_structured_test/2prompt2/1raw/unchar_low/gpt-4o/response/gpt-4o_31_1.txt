To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's outline the information and steps involved:

- Prior probabilities:
  - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is \( p(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
  - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (H) is \( p(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- Likelihood:
  - The description given matches traits that could apply to professors from either group, but there are no explicit details suggesting the likelihood of these traits being more prevalent in one group over the other. Therefore, absent additional information, we assume the likelihood of these traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) is equally likely in both groups.

- Posterior probability:
  Using Bayes' theorem:

  \[
  p(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{p(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot p(\text{CS})}{p(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot p(\text{CS}) + p(D \mid \text{H}) \cdot p(\text{H})}
  \]

  Given that the likelihood \( p(D \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( p(D \mid \text{H}) \) are assumed equal, they cancel out in the calculation, leaving:

  \[
  p(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{p(\text{CS})}{p(\text{CS}) + p(\text{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
  \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Here is the answer: 
{"probability": "0.25"}
