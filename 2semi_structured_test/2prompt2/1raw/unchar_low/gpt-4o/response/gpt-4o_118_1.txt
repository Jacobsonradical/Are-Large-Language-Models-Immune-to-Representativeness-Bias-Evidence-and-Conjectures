To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\(CS\)) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

Bayes' formula is given by:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)).
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\) regardless of the field.

Assuming that the description \(D\) "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation" is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, the probability \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1\), because it doesn't give us any additional distinguishing information (i.e., it's equally probable for a professor in either field to fit that description).

Therefore, we can simplify to:

\[
P(CS | D) = P(CS) = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
{\ "probability"\ :\ "0.25\ " }
\]
