To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   Since we don't have specific likelihoods for descriptions between the two groups, we assume there's no strong distinguishing feature in the description that makes it more likely to belong to one group over the other. Therefore, we assume \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H}) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} 
\]

Given our assumption:

\[
P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H})
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) 
\]

Since \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H}) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.75 = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 1 = P(D|\text{CS})
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|\text{CS})} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{0.25}
\]
