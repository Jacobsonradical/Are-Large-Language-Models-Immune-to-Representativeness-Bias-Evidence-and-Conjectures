To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we employ Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's assume that the description given ("high ability and strong motivation ...well-liked by his colleagues.. positive reputation") is equally likely to describe professors in both fields (as we are not given any specific information that relates these traits to a specific field).
   - Therefore, for simplicity, let's assume:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}|CS) = P(\text{Description}|H) = 1
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - According to Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Since the description is assumed equally likely for both fields, the probability of getting that description:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description}|H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1
     \]

4. Therefore, the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|\text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
