To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description is given, which appears somewhat generic and doesn't heavily favor one field over the other based on the details provided.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the likelihood of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the likelihood of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

We start with the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description is equally likely to apply to professors in both fields (since no specific evidence in the description favors one field over the other), we can say:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

Based on Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

And since \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), they cancel out in the numerator and denominator, simplifying to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

Answering in the required format:
{"probability": "0.25"}
