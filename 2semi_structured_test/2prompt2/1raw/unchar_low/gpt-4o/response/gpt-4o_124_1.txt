To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability that a professor in the sample is a computer science professor: P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a professor in the sample is a humanities professor: P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We do not have specific likelihoods for the description given for Jason. Typically, in the absence of any distinguishing characteristics that highly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we assume it might be equally likely for any professor to have such a description.
   - Probability of described traits given the professor is from computer science: P(Description | CS)
   - Probability of described traits given the professor is from humanities: P(Description | Hum)

   Here, we assume:
   P(Description | CS) ≈ P(Description | Hum)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem in this case is:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability of Description:**
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Since we assumed:
   P(Description | CS) ≈ P(Description | Hum)
   
   And knowing that: 
   P(CS) and P(Hum) sum up to 1.

   The total probability of the description can be assumed to be the same for both groups, thus:
   \[
   P(Description) = \text{common likelihood} \cdot P(CS) + \text{common likelihood} \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Factoring out the common likelihood:
   \[
   P(Description) = \text{common likelihood} \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum)) = \text{common likelihood}
   \]

5. **Simplification:**
   The posterior thus simplifies due to the common likelihood:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
   \]
   Since P(Hum | Description) also follows similarly, it results in maintaining the prior ratios due to equal likelihoods:

6. **Final Posterior Calculation:**
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = P(CS)
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description is:

\[
P(CS | Description) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability in the requested format is:
