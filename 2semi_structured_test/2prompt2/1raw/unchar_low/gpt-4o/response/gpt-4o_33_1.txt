To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of getting the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of getting the description, regardless of Jason's field.

We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \)

We don't have specific data on how likely Jason's description is for each field (\( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \)), so we'll assume that the description could apply equally often to professors from either field. Therefore:
- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given that \( P(D) \) is the same in both the numerator and the denominator and assuming \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
