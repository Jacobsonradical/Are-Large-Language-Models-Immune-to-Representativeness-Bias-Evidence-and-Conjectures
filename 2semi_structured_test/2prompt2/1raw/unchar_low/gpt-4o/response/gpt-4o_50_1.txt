To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(Hum)) is 75/100 = 0.75.

Next, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of the given description under both categories. Since we only have one description and no specific information suggesting that it is more likely to belong to one group than the other, we will assume the likelihood of such a description is equally likely for both groups (P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum)).

Under the assumption that the description is equally likely for both groups, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equivalent to the prior probability. Hence:

P(CS|Description) = (P(Description|CS) * P(CS)) / P(Description)

Since P(Description|CS) is equal to P(Description|Hum), P(Description) cancels out and we are left with:

P(CS|Description) = P(CS) = 0.25

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
