To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science (CS) department \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (Hum) department \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Identify the probability of the description given that the professor is from a particular department**:
   - Let \( D \) be the event that a professor matches Jason's description. We need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \).
   - Without specific data about the distribution of descriptions, we might assume that the probabilities of matching descriptions are roughly equal across departments. Thus:
     \[
     P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum)
     \]

3. **Calculate posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \). This can be expanded as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Since we assume that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \), let's denote:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) = k
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(Hum) = k (P(CS) + P(Hum)) = k(0.25 + 0.75) = k
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
   \]

In this case, our posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science department remains the same as the prior probability because we assumed equal likelihoods of the description given the department affiliation (i.e., non-discriminating description).

Thus, the posterior probability is:
\[
\boxed{0.25}
\]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
