To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description provided doesn't give specific information that strongly indicates whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Both groups could likely have individuals who are high ability, strongly motivated, well-liked by colleagues, and enjoy a positive reputation.
   - Therefore, we assume that the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) that this description fits a computer science professor is equal to the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) that it fits a humanities professor. 

Given that the description is equally likely to fit professors from both groups, we assume:

\[
P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
\]

3. **Calculation (Applying Bayes’ theorem):**

Bayes’ theorem formula is given by:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Briefly rephrasing, \( P(D) \) can be expanded:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), let’s call this common probability \( k \):

\[
P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(H)
\]

Factoring \( k \) out:

\[
P(D) = k \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) = k \cdot 1 = k
\]

Thus,

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
\]

The same calculation holds for the humanities, resulting in \( 0.75 \).

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\}
\]
