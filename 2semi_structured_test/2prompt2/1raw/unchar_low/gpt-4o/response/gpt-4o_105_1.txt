To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - Number of computer science professors (\(CS\)): 25
    - Number of humanities professors (\(H\)): 75
    - Total professors: 100
    
    The prior probability (\(P(CS)\)) that Jason is a computer science professor:
    \[
    P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

    The prior probability (\(P(H)\)) that Jason is a humanities professor:
    \[
    P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]

2. **Likelihood:**
    
    Since we do not have any specific likelihoods (\(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), where \(D\) is the description of Jason) suggesting that the traits described are more likely in one group over the other, we will assume that these personality traits are equally likely in both computer science and humanities professors. 

    Therefore:
    \[
    P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)
    \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
    By Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability (\(P(CS|D)\)) is given by:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]

    Similarly, the posterior probability (\(P(H|D)\)) is given by:
    \[
    P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
    \]

    Since \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\),
    \[
    P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
    \]

    Given our equal likelihood assumption:
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided is:

\[
\boxed{0.25}
\]
