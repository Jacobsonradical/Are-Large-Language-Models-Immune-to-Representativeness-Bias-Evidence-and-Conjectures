To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description provides no differentiation between the disciplines and represents either group equally well:

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1 \]

So we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
