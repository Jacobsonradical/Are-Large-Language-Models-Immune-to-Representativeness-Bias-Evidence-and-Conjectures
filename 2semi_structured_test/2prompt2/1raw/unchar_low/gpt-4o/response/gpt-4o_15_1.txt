To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability (Jason is a Computer Science professor) = \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability (Jason is a Humanities professor) = \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We are given a description that doesn't favor one group over the other directly, i.e., high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, well-liked. It's reasonable to assume that this likelihood is equal for both groups because the description is quite generic and not heavily skewed towards any specific traits that uniquely identify one group over the other.

Thus, we assume:
   - Probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor, \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \).

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) normalizes the probabilities and \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \), we have:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
