To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's set up our known values:
- We have 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H), making up a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability (before considering the description) that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Let's denote the description of Jason as \(D\).

We want to find the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\). According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to estimate \(P(D|CS)\), \(P(D|H)\), and \(P(D)\). However, we don't have specific data on how common Jason's descriptive traits are among computer science professors versus humanities professors. We must use some reasonable assumptions.

Given Jason's description, it seems fairly neutral and doesn't point strongly towards either field. Hence, we might reasonably assume that the likelihood of such a description is roughly equal for both groups: \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\).

Since \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\), the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\) will primarily reflect the prior probabilities \(P(CS)\) and \(P(H)\).

Therefore:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Given our priors:

\[ P(CS) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.75 \]

As \( P(CS) + P(H) = 1 \):

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is around 0.25.

In the required format, our answer is:
