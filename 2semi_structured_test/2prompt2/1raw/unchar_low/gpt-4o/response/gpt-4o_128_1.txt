To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.
- Prior probability that a chosen professor is from computer science \( P(CS) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability that a chosen professor is from humanities \( P(H) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need the likelihood of the description given the professor's field. Since the description provided is quite general and lacks distinctive details specific to computer science or humanities, we assume the likelihood of such a description would roughly be similar for both groups, although in practice, this might vary with more context. For simplicity, let's assume the likelihood is the same for both groups.

Given that the description does not provide strong evidence favoring one field over the other, we'll use \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) as reasonably close to each other. Let's denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) * P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \),
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \approx P(D|CS) * 0.25 + P(D|H) * 0.75 \approx P(D|CS) * (0.25 + 0.75) = P(D|CS) \]

Thus, posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(D|CS) * 0.25}{P(D|CS)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, 
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.25" \]

In conclusion:

{"probability": "0.25"}
