To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or given description of Jason.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(A) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities, \( P(A^c) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, consider the likelihood:
- Assume \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, is equal to \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Being successful and well-liked can reasonably be expected to be equally likely in both groups absent other distinguishing information in the description.

Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), they cancel out in the formula application of Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem then simplifies to the ratio of the priors:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \approx \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

This simplifies to the same prior probability because the description does not contain distinguishing information that changes likelihood estimates.

Thus, the posterior probability is:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: \text{"0.25"}\} \]
