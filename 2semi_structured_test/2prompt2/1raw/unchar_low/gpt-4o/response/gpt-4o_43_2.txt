To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to consider the base rates and the given description.

Initially, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. This translates to base probabilities of:

- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

Given this base rate, let's denote:
- \(P(\text{CS})\) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Humanities})\) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Now, given Jason's description, which does not provide strong distinguishing information specific to either group based on the description provided (such as age, marital status, professional respect, motivation, etc., which could potentially be found in both groups), our best estimate of the posterior probabilities is based largely on the priors unless we have specific likelihood ratios favoring one group over the other from the description.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains equivalent to the base rate ratio. Thus:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
