To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayesian reasoning involves calculating the likelihood of various hypotheses given the available data.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The number of computer science professors in the study is 25.
   - The number of humanities professors in the study is 75.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is:
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We don't have explicit information about the likelihood of the given description among computer science professors versus humanities professors. Therefore, we must assume that the likelihood \(P(Description | CS)\) and \(P(Description | Hum)\) are equally probable if not otherwise specified.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - The posterior probability can be found using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
     \]
   - Similarly for humanities, but since we are only asked for the probability concerning computer science professors, we donâ€™t need to calculate it for humanities.

Given the likelihoods are assumed equal and normalizing over both, the posterior simplifies to give us effectively:

     \[
     P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
     \]

Since the likelihoods are equal, the final posterior closely aligns with the prior probabilities adjusted to the context, hence mathematically:

     \[
     P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.25
     \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.25"}
