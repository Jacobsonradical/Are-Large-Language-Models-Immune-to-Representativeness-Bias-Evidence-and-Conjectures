To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let’s define our terms based on the given problem:

1. **Prior Probability of Being a Computer Science Professor (P(CS)):**
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability of Being a Humanities Professor (P(H)):**
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood of the Description Given CS Professor (P(D|CS)):** 
   Since there's no specific data differentiating the likelihood of the description for CS versus humanities professors, we’ll assume it's equal for both, so:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
   \]

4. **Likelihood of the Description Given Humanities Professor (P(D|H)):** 
   As assumed above:
   \[
   P(D|H) = P(D|CS)
   \]

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Because \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), they cancel each other out in the calculation of the normalizing factor \(P(D)\). Thus, we only need to compare the prior probabilities:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
