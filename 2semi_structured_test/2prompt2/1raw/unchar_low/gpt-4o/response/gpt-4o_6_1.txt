To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the numbers in the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to assume that the description alone does not favor either group (since we have no specific data indicating the probability of the description within each group):
- \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \)

Then:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = k \).

Thus:
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
