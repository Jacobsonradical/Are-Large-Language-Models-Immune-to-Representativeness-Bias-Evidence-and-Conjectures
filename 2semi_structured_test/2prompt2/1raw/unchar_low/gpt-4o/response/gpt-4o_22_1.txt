To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Given the data:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' Theorem formula for this scenario is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of seeing his description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from the computer science group, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since we do not have specific information on how likely the description is to appear in each group, we initially assume the description is equally likely for professors from both groups. Therefore, \( P(D | CS) \) is approximately equal to \( P(D | H) \).

Given this assumption, we can simplify:

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

Using this assumption, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from the humanities group, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Substituting the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
