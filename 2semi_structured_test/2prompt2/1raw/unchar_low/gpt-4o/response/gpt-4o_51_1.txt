To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{ P(B) } \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description regardless of the field.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(\neg A) \) is:
     \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Assuming \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal**:
   - Since we are given no information to suggest that the description of Jason is more likely to be that of a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we can assume that:
     \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Under this assumption, the Bayesian update would maintain the original ratio of prior probabilities because the likelihood of the description does not favor either group.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) would be the same as the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
