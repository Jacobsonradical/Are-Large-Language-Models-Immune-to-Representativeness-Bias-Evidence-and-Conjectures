To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's designate some variables for clarity:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given the data:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

As we do not have more specific information about \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) (the probabilities that a description like Jason's would be for a computer science professor or a humanities professor), we assume that Jasonâ€™s described traits are equally likely among computer science and humanities professors. This assumption states that:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Under this equal likelihood scenario, \( P(D) \) can be represented as a weighted average:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), we can represent it as simply \( P(D|CS) \) for calculation:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
