To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the description provided, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define our terms:
- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We don't have specific details about the probabilities \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), so we'll assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields based on the available information. This allows us to focus on the ratio of the priors.

The prior probability \( P(C) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we assume the description \( D \) is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(D | C) = P(D | H) \]

Thus, the overall probability \( P(D) \) does not change the ratio and the posterior probability \( P(C | D) \) will be proportional to the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} = P(C) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \frac{0.25}{(0.25 + ((75/25) \cdot 0.25))} = \frac{0.25}{(0.25 + 3 \cdot 0.25)} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
