To compute the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
Because there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the description is relatively general and doesn't provide highly specific information distinguishing between the two fields, we might assume these likelihoods to be roughly equal. However, letâ€™s assume any slight bias (if assumed) towards a certain characteristic. 

But for simplicity here, we assume equal likelihood (\( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \)):

Therefore, Bayes' theorem simplifies to the prior probability because the ratio of the likelihoods will be 1:

\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) \]

So based on this assumption:

{"probability": "0.25"}
