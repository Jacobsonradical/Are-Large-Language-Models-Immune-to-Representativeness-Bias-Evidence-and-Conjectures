To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) as the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

For simplicity, we will assume that the provided description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors since no specific details favor one group. Thus, \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are both considered to be the same. Letâ€™s assume they are both equal to 1 (because we don't have reasons to estimate them differently based on the description alone).

Thus:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Now, we compute the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)} \]

Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), this simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

The answer in the required format is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
