To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, define the following:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Using the given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we don't have specific information indicating that the description is more likely to belong to one group over the other, we can assume the descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Therefore:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \).

By applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}. \]

Simplifying, and since the descriptions are equally likely:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25. \]

Thus, given the assumptions and the information provided, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
