To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is how we can approach the problem:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** The prior probability of a professor being in computer science.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(Humanities)):** The prior probability of a professor being in the humanities.
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(Description | CS)):** The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   
4. **Likelihood (P(Description | Humanities)):** The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since we do not have specific likelihoods from the personality descriptions, we assume the description is equally likely for individuals from both fields. Thus, 
   \[
   P(\text{Description | CS}) = P(\text{Description | Humanities})
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability (P(CS | Description)):** Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS | Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description | CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both CS and Humanities, it cancels out in the ratio:
   \[
   P(\text{CS | Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description | CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description | CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description | Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}
   \]

Since we assume \( P(\text{Description | CS}) = P(\text{Description | Humanities}) \):

   \[
   P(\text{CS | Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \times \frac{1}{1} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\{
   "probability": "0.25"
\}
