To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, let's look at our prior probabilities based on the number of professors sampled from each discipline:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(C) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We are using a description to update our beliefs, but since the description given does not contain discipline-specific information that would affect the conditional probability, we can assume the likelihood is similar across groups based on the information provided.

Let's denote the description of Jason by \( D \). Since the description doesn't directly indicate any discipline-specific traits and there is no reason to believe the description favors one discipline over the other, we can assume \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given that \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \):

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
