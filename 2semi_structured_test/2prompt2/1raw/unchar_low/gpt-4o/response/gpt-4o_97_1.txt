To determine the posterior probability, we apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( Desc \) as the event we receive Jason's description.

We want to calculate \( P(CS|Desc) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
\]

First, we need to determine:
- \( P(CS) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
  
Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the priors are:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need \( P(Desc) \), the total probability of getting Jason's description. This can be expanded as:

\[
P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups (we have no reason to assume otherwise without additional information):

\[ 
P(Desc|CS) = P(Desc|H)
\]

If we denote \( P(Desc|CS) = P(Desc|H) = k \), then:

\[
P(Desc) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(H) = k ( P(CS) + P(H) ) = k (0.25 + 0.75) = k
\]

Thus, the updated posterior probability simplifies to:

\[
P(CS|Desc) = \frac{k \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{\{ "probability": "0.25" \}}
\]
