To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event described as Jason's personality traits.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(A_{CS}) \)) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(A_H) \)) = 75

The prior probability \( P(A_{CS}) \) is:
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A_H) \) is:
\[ P(A_H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we don't have specific likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_H) \) and we assume that the description applies equally to computer science and humanities professors, \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) can be considered equal to \( P(B|A_H) \).

Thus, the overall probability \( P(B) \) becomes:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_H) \cdot P(A_H) \]

Since the likelihoods are equal, they cancel out, and we get:

\[ P(B) = P(A_{CS}) + P(A_H) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

But since the likelihoods \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_H) \) are equal and \( P(B) = 1 \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_H)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
