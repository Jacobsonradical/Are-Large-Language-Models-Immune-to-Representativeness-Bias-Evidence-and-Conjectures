To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event described about Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that:
- There are 25 computer science professors (successful academics).
- There are 75 humanities professors (successful academics).

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For simplicity, if we assume that the description fits equally well to both groups (since there is no specific information indicating a bias), then:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

If we assume that the description is equally likely for either group:
\[ P(B|A) = 1 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

So we calculate the updated probability based on these assumptions:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

The posterior probability is then:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
