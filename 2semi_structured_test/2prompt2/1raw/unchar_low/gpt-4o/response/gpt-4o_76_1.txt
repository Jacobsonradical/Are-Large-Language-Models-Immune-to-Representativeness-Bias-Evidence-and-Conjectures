To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the given information:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
    - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(\text{Hum})\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**: Since the description provided is not specific to a particular field, Jasonâ€™s description is assumed to be equally likely for both sets of professors. Therefore:
    - Probability that Jason matches the description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS})\)): \(1\)
    - Probability that Jason matches the description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum})\)): \(1\)

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})} \]

Since \(P(\text{Desc})\) can be calculated as:
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Putting everything together:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
