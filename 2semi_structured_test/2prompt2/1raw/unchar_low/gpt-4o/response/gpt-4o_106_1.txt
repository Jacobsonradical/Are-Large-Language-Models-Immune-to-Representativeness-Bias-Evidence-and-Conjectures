To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem gives us: 

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we need to find the terms on the right-hand side:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   
2. **Probability of the Description** \( P(D) \):

   \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \) across both groups:
   
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)
   \]
   
   Since the description \( D \) is given, and without specific information favoring either group,
   we can assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). In this case, simplification happens, but realistically we should assume equal likelihood unless more detail is offered.
   
3. Substituting equal likelihood:

   If we assume \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), then they effectively cancel each other out in the ratio since they are equal:
   
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
   \]
   
   Therefore:

   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, based on the given probability (equal weights to default):

\[
P(C|D) \approx 0.25
\]

The final probability is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
