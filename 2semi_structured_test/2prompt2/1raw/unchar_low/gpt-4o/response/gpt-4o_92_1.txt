To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's first define the necessary probabilities and counts:

1. The number of computer science professors (CS) in the sample: \( \text{Count(CS)} = 25 \)
2. The number of humanities professors (H) in the sample: \( \text{Count(H)} = 75 \)
3. The total number of professors: \( \text{Total} = 100 \)

We are given the following:

- Prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{\text{Count(CS)}}{\text{Total}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{\text{Count(H)}}{\text{Total}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We are provided with the personality description of Jason. While the problem does not directly provide likelihoods, we need to consider that this description might be equally probable for both groups unless specific traits strongly distinguish computer science and humanities professors, which is not indicated by the description.

Thus, assuming the description is equally likely across both groups:

- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(Description | CS) \)): \( k \)
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(Description | H) \)): \( k \)

Where \( k \) is a constant representing the equal likelihood for both groups.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Since \( P(Description) \) is a normalizing constant and will be equal for both:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
