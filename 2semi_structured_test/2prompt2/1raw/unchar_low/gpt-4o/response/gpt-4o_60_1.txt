To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let us define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a tenured and successful computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided fits Jason.

Given:
- Number of tenured and successful computer science professors (\(N_{CS}\)) = 25
- Number of tenured and successful humanities professors (\(N_{H}\)) = 75

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{N_{CS}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{N_{H}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{75}{25 + 75} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To proceed, we make an assumption that the description fits computer science professors (\( P(B|A) \)) and humanities professors (\( P(B|\neg A) \)) equally well, since no specific information in the description pertains to a particular field. Thus, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

In this case:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
