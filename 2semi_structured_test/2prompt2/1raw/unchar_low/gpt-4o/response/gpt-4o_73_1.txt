To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let’s identify the key numbers:
- Total number of professors = 100
  - Computer science professors (CS) = 25
  - Humanities professors (H) = 75

Prior probabilities:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

The description given for Jason does not provide specific traits that are unique to either computer science or humanities professors. So, we can assume that the description of Jason being well-liked, high ability, and strong motivation apply equally to both groups.

Let’s assume that the likelihood (\(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\)) of receiving such a description is equal for both computer science professors and humanities professors. For simplicity, we can assume:
- \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1\)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\) and they are equal, we can simplify:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
