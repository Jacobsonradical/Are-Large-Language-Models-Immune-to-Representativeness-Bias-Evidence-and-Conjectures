To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(H) \): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(D \mid CS) \): Since we have no information suggesting that the description is more or less likely for either group, we will assume it is equally likely. Thus \( P(D \mid CS) = 1 \).
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(D \mid H) \): Similarly, we will assume \( P(D \mid H) = 1 \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - We need to calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
\[ P(D \mid CS) = 1, \quad P(CS) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(D \mid H) = 1, \quad P(H) = 0.75 \]

So,
\[ P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.25) + (1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Now,
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
