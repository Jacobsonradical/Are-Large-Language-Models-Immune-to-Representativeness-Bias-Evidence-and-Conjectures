To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting Jason's description.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**
   The prior probability that Jason is from the computer science group:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   
2. **Complement Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**
   The probability that Jason is from the humanities (complement of being from computer science):
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**
   Since we donâ€™t have specific detailed distributions of the descriptions among computer science and humanities professors, we can assume that the description "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked" is equally likely for both groups. Hence:
   
   \[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]
   
   Note: Because we were not given specific probabilities or distributions of characteristics for the two groups, and many such attributes (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are reasonably expected to be common to successful professors in both fields, we assume they are equally likely. However, this simplification is an assumption due to lack of specific data.
   
4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**
   The probability of a professor having Jason's description can be estimated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]
   As \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are considered equal and denoted as k.

Given these assumptions and without a more specific distribution of traits, the posterior probability does not change from the prior and remains:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
