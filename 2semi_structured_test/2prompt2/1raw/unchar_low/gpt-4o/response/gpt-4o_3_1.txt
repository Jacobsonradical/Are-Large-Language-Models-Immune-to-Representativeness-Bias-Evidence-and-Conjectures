To make an informed estimate of the posterior probability, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new information. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_2 \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): The description given about Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

We can break this down into the following steps:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(H_1) \): The probability that the randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors, this probability is:
     \[ P(H_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

   - \( P(H_2) \): The probability that the randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. Since there are 75 humanities professors, this probability is:
     \[ P(H_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(E \mid H_1) \): The probability of the given description for a computer science professor.
   - \( P(E \mid H_2) \): The probability of the given description for a humanities professor.

   Given the description, it seems relatively neutral and does not provide specific clues that would heavily favor one group over the other. Without additional information, we might reasonably assume that any such description could be equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, let's assume:
   \[ P(E \mid H_1) = P(E \mid H_2) \]

3. **Total Probability**:
   - \( P(E) \): The total probability of getting the description irrespective of the group. It can be computed as:
     \[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Since we assumed \( P(E \mid H_1) = P(E \mid H_2) \), let's denote this common likelihood as \( P(E \mid H) \).

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot (P(H_1) + P(H_2)) \]
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \]

Now, substituting in Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E \mid H)} \]

Since \( P(E \mid H) \) cancels out,

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = P(H_1) \]

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.25"}
