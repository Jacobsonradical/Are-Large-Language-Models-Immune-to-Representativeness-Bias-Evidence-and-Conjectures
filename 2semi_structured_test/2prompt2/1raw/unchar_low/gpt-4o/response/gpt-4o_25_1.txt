To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description.

First, let's define the relevant variables:
- \( A \): Event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \): Event that Jason fits the given description.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to find and understand each component of this equation:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   Since there are 25 tenured computer science professors and 75 tenured humanities professors, the probability \( P(A) \) is:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
   Assuming, given no specific distinguishing traits in the description favoring one group over the other (this is an assumption due to the lack of detailed distinguishing features), we consider this probability as being equal for the members of each group. 

3. \( P(B) \): The probability of the given description for any professor in the sample.
   Since we're assuming the description doesn't favor one group over another, \( P(B) \) is simply the probability of picking any one professor (which can be considered 1, since a description must exist for each professor).

Considering the symmetry and no distinguishing features present:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not-}A) \)

Hence:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
