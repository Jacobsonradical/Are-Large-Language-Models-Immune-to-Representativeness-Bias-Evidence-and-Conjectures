To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason matches the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to estimate each term in this formula:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of the description.

Let's find these probabilities step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Probability of the Description \( P(B) \)**:
   - Jason can be either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 
   - To simplify, assume the likelihood of having the description does not largely differ between computer science and humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \).
   - Let \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) be assumed equal and represented as \( k \).
   - So, \( P(B) \approx k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), we simplify:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
