To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the observed evidence to come up with a posterior probability.

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS and Humanities))**:
   - Probability that someone from the sample is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that someone from the sample is a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   
2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description does not give clear indicators that would make Jason more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor specifically. Hence, the likelihood can be seen as equal for both groups, given the provided description.

Thus, based on the absence of specific differential evidence (since the description does not favor either group), the posterior probability will largely align with the prior probability. 

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
