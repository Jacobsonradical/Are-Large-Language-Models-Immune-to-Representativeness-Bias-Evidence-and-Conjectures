To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the data from the study:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75

Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Based solely on the description, without additional specific probabilistic information about how likely the description fits within each group, we may assume that the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either group. This assumption simplifies \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\) to be roughly equal, canceling each other out. Therefore, the final determination relies mainly on the prior probabilities.

So:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Under the assumption of equal likelihood given the lack of specific differentiating factors in the provided description, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
