To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science (CS): \( P(CS) \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Humanities (H): \( P(H) \)

   From the numbers given:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: 

   The likelihood provided by Jason's description is challenging to differentiate between CS and Humanities due to the general nature of the description. So, let's make an assumption that Jason's traits are equally likely to be exhibited by professors in both fields (which is often a simplifying but necessary assumption in the absence of specific likelihood data).

   Thus:
   - \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \)

Given that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields, these likelihoods cancel out. The posterior probability therefore heavily relies on the prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Notice that \( P(description) \) can be broken down using the law of total probability:

\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(description | CS) \) is equal to \( P(description | H) \), they cancel each other out and we're left with:

\[ P(CS | description) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
