To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

We have:
- A prior probability based on the proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the study.
- A likelihood based on how representative the description of Jason is for computer science professors versus humanities professors.

The study included 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, which leads to:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, assume any specific personality description among successful professors in either domain is equally likely. In this simplistic case where we assume no additional information about differences in personality traits between fields (which the description doesn't provide), we proceed with using the base rates provided by the composition of the sample.

So, let’s denote the event:

- \( E \): The description fits Jason.

We are interested in \( P(\text{CS} | E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Because we assume the description does not differentiate between fields:
\[ P(E | \text{CS}) = P(E | \text{Humanities}) \]

Using the law of total probability, we get:
\[ P(E) = P(E | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(E | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Since \( P(E | \text{CS}) = P(E | \text{Humanities}) \), let’s set \( P(E | \text{CS}) = P(E | \text{Humanities}) = k \):

\[ P(E) = k \cdot P(\text{CS}) + k \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(E) = k ( P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities}) ) \]
\[ P(E) = k \] (since \( P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities}) = 1 \))

Thus:

\[ P(\text{CS} | E) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability remains the same as the prior probability due to the equal likelihood assumption of personality descriptions. So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
