To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the necessary probabilities:

1. P(CS) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. P(H) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:

P(CS) = 25 / 100 = 0.25
P(H) = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Next, we need to consider the description we are given about Jason and how likely it is for professors in computer science and the humanities to match that description.

Since the description is quite general and non-specific, we might assume that the description "high ability and strong motivation," and being "well-liked," etc., could apply equally to professors in either field. Thus, we assume:

P(description | CS) = P(description | H) = 1 (since it's non-discriminative in this instance)

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

P(CS | description) = (P(description | CS) * P(CS)) / (P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | H) * P(H))

Substituting the values:

P(CS | description) = (1 * 0.25) / (1 * 0.25 + 1 * 0.75) = 0.25 / (0.25 + 0.75) = 0.25 / 1 = 0.25

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
