To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Let's assume that personality descriptions are equally likely for professors in both groups since no evidence suggests otherwise.

First, calculate the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)):

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(\neg A) \)):

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we assume that Jason's description could apply equally to professors in both disciplines, the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal and do not differentiate between the groups.

Thus, we can summarize the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A|B) \)) without modifying our prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}} \]
