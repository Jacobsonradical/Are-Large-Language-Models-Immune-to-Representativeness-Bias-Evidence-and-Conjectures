To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25 out of 100 professors, so \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \).
   - Probability Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)): 75 out of 100 professors, so \( P(\text{Hum}) = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor (P(Desc | CS)) and the likelihood that Jason fits the description given that he is a humanities professor (P(Desc | Hum)) are not explicitly provided in the description. Without further specifics about how personality traits like high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked differ between the fields, we assume they don’t bias towards one field.
   - Let's assume these traits are just as likely in both groups. So \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \).

3. **Posterior probability**:
   - Using Bayes’ Theorem:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})}
     \]
   - Since \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \) and \( P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \times P(\text{Hum}) \), these likelihood terms cancel out.

Thus:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25
\]

Given the lack of specific distinguishing information in the description, we rely solely on the prior probabilities.

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
