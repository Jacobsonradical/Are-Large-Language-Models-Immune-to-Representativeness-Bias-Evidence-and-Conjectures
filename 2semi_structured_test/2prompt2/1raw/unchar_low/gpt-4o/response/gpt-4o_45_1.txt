To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break down the calculation step by step.

1. **Prior probability ( \( P(A) \)):**
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, for a total of 100 professors. So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary prior probability ( \( P(A') \)):**
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Humanities}) \)) is:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood ( \( P(B|A) \)):**
   \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Since we do not have specific data to distinguish differences in the description probabilities between the groups, we must assume the probability of receiving Jason's description given he is a computer science professor is the same as receiving it given he is a humanities professor. Without additional information, we assume this probability is equal for both groups.

4. **Total probability ( \( P(B) \)):**
   The total probability of the description is a weighted average:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   Given equal likelihoods:
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot 25 + \frac{1}{100} \cdot 75 = \frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100} = 1
   \]

Since each description is assumed equally likely among the groups, the likelihood ratio does not affect the posterior calculation, leaving us with the base rate as our best estimate:

5. **Bayes' theorem update:**
   Since \( P(B|\text{CS}) = P(B|\text{Humanities}) \), the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = P(\text{CS})
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]

This matches our prior belief since we have no additional distinguishing information in the description to update our probability.
