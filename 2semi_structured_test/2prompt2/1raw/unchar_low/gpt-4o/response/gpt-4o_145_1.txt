To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(\text{C}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \) be the probability of observing a given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{D}|\text{H}) \) be the probability of observing a given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{D}) \) be the overall probability of observing the description.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(\text{C}) =  \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{C}|\text{D}) = \frac{P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(\text{D})} \]

Since there is no specific indication that the description is more or less likely for computer science or humanities professors (i.e., we assume \( P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \approx P(\text{D}|\text{H}) \)), we can treat these as equal probabilities. This simplifies our calculation because the \( P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \) and \( P(\text{D}|\text{H}) \) terms cancel out.

\[ P(\text{D}) = P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C}) + P(\text{D}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
Again, since \( P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \approx P(\text{D}|\text{H}) \), this simplifies to:
\[ P(\text{D}) \approx P(\text{D}|\text{C}) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{C}|\text{D}) \approx \frac{P(\text{C})}{P(\text{C}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
