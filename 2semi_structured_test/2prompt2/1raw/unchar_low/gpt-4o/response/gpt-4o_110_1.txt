To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \) â€” the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Let's break this down:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \)**:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
Given that we don't have any specific information indicating that Jason's description is more likely for one group over the other, we can assume (for simplicity) that the descriptions are equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \), and \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k (0.25 + 0.75) = k \]
Where \( k \) is a common factor representing \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Now we can calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
