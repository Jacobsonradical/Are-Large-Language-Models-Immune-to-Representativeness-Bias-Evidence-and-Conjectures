To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities group, \( P(H) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   Although the problem does not give explicit likelihoods, we assume the descriptions don't differ significantly in distinguishing between the two groups given no additional distinguishing traits are mentioned. Therefore, we will assume:

   - \( P(D | CS) \), the probability of the description being as it is if Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | H) \), the probability of the description being as it is if Jason is a humanities professor.

   Since we don't have enough information to differentiate the likelihoods, we'll assume these probabilities are the same and cancel each other out in Bayes' Theorem.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   The denominator \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
   \]

   Given our assumption that \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Since the likelihoods were assumed to be the same, the prior probabilities dominate the calculation in this simplified model.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
