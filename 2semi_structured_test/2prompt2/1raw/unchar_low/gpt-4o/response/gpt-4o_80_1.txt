Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's remember the base rates:  
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Next, given the base rates, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that clearly discriminates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we assume that the probability of obtaining a description like Jason's is roughly equal for both groups, i.e., \( P(description | CS) \approx P(description | H) \).

Given that, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

However, if we assume \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | H) \) are about equal, then:

\[ P(description) \approx P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | H) * P(H) \]

Since \( P(description | CS) \approx P(description | H) \),
  
\[ P(description) \approx k * (P(CS) + P(H)) = k * 1 \]

where \( k \) is a proportionality constant that cancels out in the equation.

Thus, \( P(CS | description) \) simplifies back to the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | description) \approx P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
