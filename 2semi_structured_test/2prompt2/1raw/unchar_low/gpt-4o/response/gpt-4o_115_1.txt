To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it would look step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors (CS).
   - There are 75 humanities professors (H).
   - Prior probability of a professor being in computer science, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Prior probability of a professor being in humanities, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description of Jason does not provide specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. For simplicity, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) = 1 \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability can be computed as:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups and the description is equally likely under both hypotheses:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25
     \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
