To address the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' theorem formula in this context is as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Secondly, we need the probabilities of the description given the types of professors:
Since there's no specific information in the description that would make it more likely to be about one field over the other, we assume the descriptions are equally likely for both groups:
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H}) = 1 \)

However, with the generic description and no specific weighting, we can also assume \( P(D) \) is simply the normalizing constant.

Since both probabilities \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(D|\text{H}) \) are equal, Bayes' theorem can be simplified under these assumptions.

Now, calculate:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Because \( P(D) \) is generally the summation of all weighted priors:
\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Now apply:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
