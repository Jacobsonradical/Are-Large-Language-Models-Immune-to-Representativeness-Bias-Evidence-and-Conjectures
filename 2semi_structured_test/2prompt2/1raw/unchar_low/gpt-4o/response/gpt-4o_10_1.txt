To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we have Jason's given description.

We need to calculate or estimate the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \), the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description of Jason being well-liked, highly capable, and strongly motivated is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors (since no specific trait distinctly points towards either field):

- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), we can denote this common value as \( P(B|C) \).

Then:
\[ P(B|C) \cdot P(A) + P(B|C) \cdot P(\neg A) = P(B|C) (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = P(B|C) \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|C) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|C)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, when the given description is equally likely for both groups, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
