To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. 

We'll denote:
- \(H_{CS}\) as the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_{H}\) as the hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(E\) as the given evidence (description of Jason).

We want to find \(P(H_{CS} | E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E | H_{CS})\) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis \(H_{CS}\) (how likely the description fits a computer science professor).
- \(P(H_{CS})\) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \(H_{CS}\), before considering evidence.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- \(P(H_{CS}) = 25 / 100 = 0.25\)
- \(P(H_{H}) = 75 / 100 = 0.75\)

Next, without additional specific evidence favoring either discipline more likely fitting the description, we assume the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is equally likely for both groups. Thus:
- \(P(E | H_{CS}) \approx P(E | H_{H}) \approx 1\)

Now, let's find \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]
\[ P(E) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Finally, we find the posterior probability:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
