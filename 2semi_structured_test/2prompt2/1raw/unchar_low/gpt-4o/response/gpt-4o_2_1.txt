Our task is to use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   And the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   To proceed further, we'd consider the likelihood, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \). Given that the description provided is fairly generic and doesn't include specific clues that strongly indicate Jason's field, we will assume these are roughly equal for simplicity unless further context indicates otherwise.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   We utilize Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Similarly,
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since the likelihoods are considered approximately equal:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities})
   \]

   Simplifies to:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})}
   \]

   Substituting the priors:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.0} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
