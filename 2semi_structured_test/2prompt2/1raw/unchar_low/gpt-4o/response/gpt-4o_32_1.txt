To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

The prior probability, \( P(CS) \), that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the study:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability, \( P(H) \), that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the description given the professor's field. Since we don't have specific likelihood values from the data, we'll assume the description provided does not give us differential predictive information about Jasonâ€™s field of expertise (both groups are equally likely to have such descriptions). This means that \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), where \(D\) is the description provided.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups and cancels out, we simplify it to:

\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, remains:

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Hence, the posterior probability is:
