To derive the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities of Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor, based on the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

So, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D | CS) \)) and that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D | H) \)). Since we have no specific reason to believe that the description provided is more or less likely given either group, we assume these probabilities are approximately equal. Thus:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \approx 1 \)

Given all this, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups and effectively cancels out, the posterior probability is proportional to our prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS | D) \propto P(CS) \]

Hence:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
