To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

First, let's define the given probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, this can be calculated as \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A') \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we do not have specific information that differentiates the description between the two groups of professors, we will assume that the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are equal. This means that a randomly chosen professor from either group is equally likely to match the given description.

Therefore, the likelihoods are:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \)

Using these values in Bayes' theorem, \( P(B) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Given that \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are equal, they cancel out in the equation. So, the posterior probability depends solely on the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A')} = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A')} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
