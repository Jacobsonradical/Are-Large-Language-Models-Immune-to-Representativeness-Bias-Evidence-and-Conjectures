To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor given the provided description.

First, let's list what we know:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The prior probability (\(P(CS)\)) of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability (\(P(HS)\)) of Jason being a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since we're comparing two hypotheses (CS: computer science professor, HS: humanities professor), we need to consider the relative likelihoods:

\[ \frac{P(CS | D)}{P(HS | D)} = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | HS) \cdot P(HS)} \]

But we need to convert this into a probability. So let's set up the full equation for posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HS) \cdot P(HS)} \]

However, without further details on how distinctive "high ability," "strong motivation," and "well-liked by colleagues" are between the two groups, we will assume that these traits are equally likely for both groups. This is a simplifying assumption due to lack of specific data. Therefore:

\[ P(D | CS) ≈ P(D | HS) \]

Given this assumption, the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) ≈ \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HS)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the information provided, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
