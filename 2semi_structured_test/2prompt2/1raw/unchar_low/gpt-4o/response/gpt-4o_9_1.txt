To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to compute this:

1. **Identify the prior probabilities:**
   - Prior probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Determine the likelihoods and evidence:**
   Given that the description (Jason) matches traits one might expect to find in either group, assume that the personality description provided is equally likely to come from both groups (since no distinguishing information is given that would significantly skew the probability).

   - Likelihood of the description given CS professor: \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx 1 \)
   - Likelihood of the description given Humanities professor: \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \approx 1 \)

3. **Compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**
   
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is a normalization factor and equal for both groups, it can be omitted for ratio comparisons:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) \propto 1 \times 0.25
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}|\text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \propto 1 \times 0.75
   \]

   Normalize these proportions:

   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
