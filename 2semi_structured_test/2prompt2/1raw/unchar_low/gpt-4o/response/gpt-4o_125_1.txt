To evaluate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We need:
1. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \).
2. The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \).
3. The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
4. The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \).

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so the prior probability \( P(CS) \) is 0.25.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so the prior probability \( P(H) \) is 0.75.

Because we are not given any specific information that would make Jason's description more likely for computer science professors than for humanities professors (the description is fairly generic and could apply equally well to either group), we could assume that the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is just a normalization factor and \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Using the priors:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
