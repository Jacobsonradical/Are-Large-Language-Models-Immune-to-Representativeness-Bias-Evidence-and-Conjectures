To evaluate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant formulation:

\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CompSci}) \times P(\text{CompSci})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CompSci}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CompSci}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Firstly, we know the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(\text{CompSci}) \) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

If we assume that descriptions for the professors are equally likely, we can simplify our problem. However, based on the description provided, we need to evaluate how likely it is that both computer science and humanities professors would match Jason's described traits.

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate, but not particularly technical), it is more likely to match the profile of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, assuming that traits like 'not particularly technical' align less with computer science and more with humanities.

For simplicity, if we assume the likelihood \( P(\text{description}|\text{CompSci}) \) is low (let's arbitrarily assume 0.1 for the sake of example) and \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \) is high (let's assume 0.9), then:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CompSci}) \times P(\text{CompSci}) + P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Therefore,
\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ \text{Posterior Probability} \approx 0.036 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036 (rounded to three decimal places).
