To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need:

1. The prior probability of the description coming from a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)).
2. The prior probability of the description coming from a humanities professor (\(P(H))\)).
3. The likelihood of the given description assuming it belongs to a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS))\)).
4. The likelihood of the given description assuming it belongs to a humanities professor (\(P(D|H))\)).

Given data:
- Total professors: 100
- Computer science professors: 25
- Humanities professors: 75

Given the description, let's assume the probability of such a description being a humanities professor or a computer science professor.

Assumptions:
- \(P(D|H)\): Higher because the description matches common traits found in humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring).
- \(P(D|CS)\): Lower because the description does not match common traits found in computer science (not particularly technical).

Let's assume:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\)

Now, compute the priors:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
