To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods. Given Jason's description, we should consider:
- \( P(B|A) \): How likely is it that a computer science professor has Jason's traits?
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): How likely is it that a humanities professor has Jason's traits?

Given Jason's creative, imaginative, emotionally driven traits, and the fact that he is not particularly technical, it seems more consistent with the profile of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. For simplicity, letâ€™s make a rough estimate:

- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (since these traits are less common in computer science professors).
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.6 \) (since these traits are more common in humanities professors).

Using these probabilities, we can find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.475 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.475 } \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ 0.025 }{ 0.475 } \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0526.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0526"}
