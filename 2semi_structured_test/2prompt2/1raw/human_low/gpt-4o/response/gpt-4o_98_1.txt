Given the base rates provided in the problem, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making the initial probabilities 0.25 for computer science and 0.75 for humanities.

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to adjust these base rates based on the description provided for Jason.

1. **Calculate Base Rate Probabilities (Prior Probabilities):**
    - Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = 0.25 \)
    - Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(HUM) = 0.75 \)

2. **Estimate Likelihood:**
    - Consider the description of Jason: creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical. 
    - These traits seem to align more closely with common stereotypes of humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

Let's assume the following likelihoods for someone with Jason's traits:
    - Probability of being like Jason given a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (relatively low)
    - Probability of being like Jason given a humanities professor, \( P(D|HUM) = 0.9 \) (relatively high)

3. **Normalize Using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) } \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 } \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ 0.025 }{ 0.025 + 0.675 } \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ 0.025 }{ 0.7 } \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036, or 3.6%.
