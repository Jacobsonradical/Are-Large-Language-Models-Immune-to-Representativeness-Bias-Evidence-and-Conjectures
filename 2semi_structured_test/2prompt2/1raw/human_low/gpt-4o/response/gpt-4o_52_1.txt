To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we should use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem can be written as: 

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of any randomly chosen professor being from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We start with the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given that the sample sizes are different with 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, our base rates (prior probabilities) reflect these proportions. 

To proceed further, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Based on the description given:
- Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical."
- These traits might intuitively seem more aligned with a professor in the humanities than in computer science.

Let's assume, for the sake of this calculation:
- \( P(D|CS) \) = 0.1 (an arbitrary small number because the description doesn't particularly fit the stereotype of technical fields such as computer science)
- \( P(D|H) \) = 0.9 (a higher number because the description fits the stereotype of the humanities more closely)

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description is approximately 0.0357.

In the required format, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
