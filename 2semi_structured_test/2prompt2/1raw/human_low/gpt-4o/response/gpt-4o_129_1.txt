This problem involves using Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability. To solve it, we first need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)):
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood that a computer science professor matches Jason's description (P(D|CS)): Since Jason is described as not particularly technical and more creative (traits more associated with the humanities), this likelihood may be low.
   - Likelihood that a humanities professor matches Jason’s description (P(D|H)): Given the description, this likelihood might be high.

Since specific probability values for P(D|CS) and P(D|H) are not provided, we can make a qualitative inference:

Given that Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, non-technical) are more typical for humanities professors than for computer science professors, we would assume the following:

   \[
   P(D|CS) << P(D|H)
   \]

Let's assign somewhat conservative values to make the calculations (assuming Jason's traits are 4 times more likely to be found within humanities professors):
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{and} \quad P(D|H) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability (Using Bayes’ Theorem):**
   - The total probability of Jason’s description:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) 
          = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) 
          = 0.05 + 0.6 
          = 0.65
     \]

   - The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
             = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} 
             = \frac{0.05}{0.65} 
             ≈ 0.0769
     \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0769 or about 7.69%.
