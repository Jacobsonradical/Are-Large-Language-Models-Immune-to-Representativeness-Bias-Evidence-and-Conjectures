To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Given:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need the likelihood:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid C) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since we do not have explicit numerical values for these likelihoods, we need to make an informed assumption based on the description provided. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical. This description seems to align more closely with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, who might be expected to be more technical.

So, we make an assumption (though subjective):
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid C) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid H) \approx 0.9 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(H \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \(P(\text{Description})\) is the same in both cases, it can be omitted for the purpose of calculating the ratio:
\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = \frac{0.025}{0.675} \]
\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} \approx \frac{1}{27} \]

Since \(P(H \mid \text{Description}) \approx 27 \cdot P(C \mid \text{Description})\), we can write:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
