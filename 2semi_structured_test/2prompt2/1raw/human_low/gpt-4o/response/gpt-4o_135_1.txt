To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the relevant information we have:

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. We need to consider how likely it is that the description matches those typically seen for computer science professors \( P(Desc | CS) \) and humanities professors \( P(Desc | H) \).

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with the typical traits we might expect from a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Without precise numerical values for these likelihoods, we need to make a reasonable estimation based on typical stereotypes.

Letâ€™s assume the likelihoods are as follows based on the description fitting more with humanities:

\[ P(Desc | CS) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(Desc | H) \approx 0.8 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | Desc) \):

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) \) is:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
