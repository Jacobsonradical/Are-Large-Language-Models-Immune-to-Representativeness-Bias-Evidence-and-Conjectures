Given the description of Jason, we need to update our prior probability to compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.

Here's the breakdown of our prior information:
- We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen description (before knowing any details) pertains to a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen description pertains to a humanities professor is \( P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' theorem, we also need to assess how likely the given description fits each group. Let's denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|HUM) \) as the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which seems more aligned with common stereotypes of humanities professors. Thus, though it's subjective, we can assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively low because the description doesnâ€™t align much with typical computer science traits.
- \( P(D|HUM) \) is relatively high as the description aligns more with typical humanities traits.

For simplicity, let's assign:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (rather low likelihood)
- \( P(D|HUM) = 0.9 \) (rather high likelihood)

Using Bayes' theorem to update the probabilities:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.0357"}
