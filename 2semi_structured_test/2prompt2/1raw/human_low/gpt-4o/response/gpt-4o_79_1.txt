To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we will take into consideration the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood of the given description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, let's establish the priors:

- Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, let's denote:

- Probability of the description fitting a computer science professor as \( P(D|CS) \)
- Probability of the description fitting a humanities professor as \( P(D|Hum) \)

Given the description, Jason seems to fit more of a humanities professor's profile (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passions not particularly technical). Without exact probabilities, assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) and \( P(D|Hum) = 0.9 \), as the description is more aligned with a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substitute in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

So the answer is: {"probability": "0.036"}
