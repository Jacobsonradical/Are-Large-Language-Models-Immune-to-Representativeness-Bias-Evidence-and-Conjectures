To determine the posterior probability of Jason being one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem combines our prior belief with the likelihood of the new evidence to give us the updated belief.

Let's define the terms:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description being given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description being given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that the professor is in computer science given the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) \) = 25/100 = 0.25 and \( P(H) \) = 75/100 = 0.75.

From the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical. Based on these traits, it seems more likely that Jason is in the humanities rather than computer science.

To proceed with Bayes' theorem, we need:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming that:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is quite low, say 0.1 (because Jason's traits don't align well with typical computer science traits).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively high, say 0.7 (because Jason's traits align well with typical humanities traits).

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.7 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

Now calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{25}{550} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{22} \]
\[ P(CS|D) â‰ˆ 0.045 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
