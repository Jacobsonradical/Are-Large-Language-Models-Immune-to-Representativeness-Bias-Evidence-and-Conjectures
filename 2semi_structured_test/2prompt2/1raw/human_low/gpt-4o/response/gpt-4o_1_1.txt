To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

In this context:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason has the given description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science).
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Since Jason's description is more aligned with traits typically associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it is reasonable to estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \) as relatively high compared to \( P(B|A) \).
  - For the sake of calculation, let's assume: 
    - \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \)
    - \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
