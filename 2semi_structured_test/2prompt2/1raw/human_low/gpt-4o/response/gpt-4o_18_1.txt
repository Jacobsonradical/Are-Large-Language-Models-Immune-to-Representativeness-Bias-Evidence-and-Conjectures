First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- The total number of professors is 100 (25 in computer science and 75 in humanities).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is 75/100 = 0.75.

Next, we assess the likelihoods. Based on Jason's description, traits like being imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical suggest a stronger alignment with the humanities than with computer science. Therefore, the likelihood of these traits given the professor is from the humanities is higher than if the professor is from computer science.

However, without concrete numerical likelihoods, we adjust our prior probabilities based on the intuition that the description fits better with a humanities professor:

Assume the likelihoods:
- P(description | humanities) ≈ 0.9 (high likelihood that humanities professors fit this description)
- P(description | CS) ≈ 0.1 (low likelihood that computer science professors fit this description)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | humanities) * P(humanities) \]

\[ P(description) ≈ (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.75) \]

\[ P(description) ≈ 0.025 + 0.675 \]

\[ P(description) ≈ 0.7 \]

So,

\[ P(CS | description) ≈ \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | description) ≈ \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | description) ≈ 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the revised probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ \boxed{ {"probability": "0.04"} } \]
