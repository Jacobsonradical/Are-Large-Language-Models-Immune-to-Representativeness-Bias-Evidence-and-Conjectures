To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of having Jason's description given that one is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of having Jason's description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**:
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihoods**:
   Assume \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description among computer science professors, and \( P(B|A^c) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description among humanities professors. We infer these from the information given:
   Since Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate but not particularly technical, it's more likely he fits the stereotype of a humanities professor. While specific probabilities are not provided, we assume:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (a fairly low probability given the supplied background of computer science)
   \[ P(B|A^c) = 0.7 \] (a higher probability given the supplied background of humanities professors)

4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.7 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

5. **Calculating Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.045 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.045 (or 4.5%).

Therefore, the answer in the specified format is:

{"probability": "0.045"}
