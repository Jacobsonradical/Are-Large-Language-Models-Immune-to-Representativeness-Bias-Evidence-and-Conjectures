To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that any given professor is from computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The probability that any given professor is from the humanities (\(P(\text{Humanities})\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})\)).
   - We also need to estimate the likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})\)).

Given the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with humanities than computer science.

Let's assume:
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.9\)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

We need \(P(\text{Description})\):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.036"}
