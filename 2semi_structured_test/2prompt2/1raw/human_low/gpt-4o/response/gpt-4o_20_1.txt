To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let:
- \( A_{CS} \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{H} \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor)
- \( P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor)

We need to estimate:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Based on the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, but not technical), it seems more likely to align with typical traits of humanities professors than those in computer science.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assign some rough probabilities based on the described traits:
- Assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \) (since Jason's description seems less typical of a computer science professor).
- Assume \( P(B|A_{H}) \approx 0.9 \) (since Jason's description seems more typical of a humanities professor).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS})P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H})P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS})P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.0357 \).
