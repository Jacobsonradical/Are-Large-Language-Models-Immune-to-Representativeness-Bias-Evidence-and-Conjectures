To address this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is useful in updating our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description given.

We are asked to find \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

So,
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to evaluate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

Since the description indicates that Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical," it fits more closely with the stereotypical traits more likely associated with a humanities professor than with a computer science professor. Therefore:
\[ P(D|C) \ll P(D|H) \]

Let's assume some reasonable values for the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (Jason is less likely to be a computer science professor based on the description)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor based on the description)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.
