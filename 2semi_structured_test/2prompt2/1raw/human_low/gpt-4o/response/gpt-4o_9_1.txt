To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's clarify what we know:
- The description is provided for one of the 100 professors.
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the description, Jason seems emotionally driven, not particularly technical, creative, imaginative, and is interested in the humanities (reading, exploring). This description fits more closely with the traits commonly associated with humanities professors rather than with the more technically driven computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.1 \) (This is a low probability because Jason's traits are not typical of a computer science professor)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \) (This is a high probability because Jason's traits are more typical of a humanities professor)

Now, using the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
