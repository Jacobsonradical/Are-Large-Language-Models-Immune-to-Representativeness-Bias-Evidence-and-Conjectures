To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the described personality traits.

First, we need to establish:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason having the described personality traits given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The marginal likelihood of the described personality traits.

Given the sample data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(A) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(\neg A) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the personality traits given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the personality traits given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys reading and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits suggest that it is more likely Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor, since the latter typically requires a higher degree of technicality.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \), considering the traits match poorly with a typical computer science professor, could be low, say 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), considering the traits match well with a typical humanities professor, could be high, say 0.9.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357 (rounded to four decimal places).
