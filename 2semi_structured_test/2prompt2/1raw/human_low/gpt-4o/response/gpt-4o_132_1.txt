To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The proportion of computer science professors out of the total sample: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The proportion of humanities professors out of the total sample: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of a professor with Jason's description being a computer science professor: \( P(description|CS) \)
   - The likelihood of a professor with his description being a humanities professor: \( P(description|Hum) \)

Given the traits listed for Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical), it might seem more likely for him to be a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. We can represent these intuitions with hypothetical likelihood values:

- Let's assume that descriptions like Jason's are somewhat more common among humanities professors. For simplicity, we could estimate:
  - \( P(description|CS) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(description|Hum) = 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.65 \]

Then, using this \( P(description) \):
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
