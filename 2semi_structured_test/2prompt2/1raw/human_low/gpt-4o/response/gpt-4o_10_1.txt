To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's lay out the details:

- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total. 
\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors total.
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), where \(D\) is the given description of Jason. 

- The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and is passionate but not technically gifted. This combination of traits may be more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Based on typical knowledge:
* It is more likely that an emotionally driven, creative, and imaginative individual with a passion for reading and exploring belongs to the humanities field rather than computer science.

Letâ€™s assume for estimation purposes:
\[
P(D|CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{(somewhat less likely for computer science)}
\]
\[
P(D|H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(more likely for humanities)}
\]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{(0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75)}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
