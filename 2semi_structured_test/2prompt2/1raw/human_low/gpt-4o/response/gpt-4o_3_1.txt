To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the described personality traits, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our target probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

First, we have:
- 25 computer science professors (Cs)
- 75 humanities professors (Hs)

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(Cs) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(Hs) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood \( P(B|A) \), which is the probability of the given description for a computer science professor vs a humanities professor.

Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which are traits generally more associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Assuming these traits are more likely to fit humanities:

Let's denote:
- \( P(description|Cs) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming less likely that a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(description|Hs) \approx 0.8 \) (assuming more likely that a humanities professor fits this description)

The total probability, \( P(B) \), of the description occurring is:

\[ P(B) = P(description|Cs) \cdot P(Cs) + P(description|Hs) \cdot P(Hs) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Cs|description) = \frac{P(description|Cs) \cdot P(Cs)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(Cs|description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(Cs|description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(Cs|description) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
