To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the given description.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in computer science. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, \( P(A_{CS}) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A_{H}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in humanities, \( P(A_{H}) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities.

Based on the description, which suggests creativity, imagination, and being emotionally driven (traits more commonly associated with humanities rather than technical fields like computer science), we can qualitatively estimate these probabilities. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (lower due to less alignment with typical computer science traits)
- \( P(B|A_{H}) = 0.9 \) (higher due to more alignment with humanities traits)

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) the total probability of the description, can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Here is the answer:
