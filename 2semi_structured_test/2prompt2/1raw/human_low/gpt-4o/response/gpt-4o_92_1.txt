Based on the given description of Jason and considering the characteristics mentioned—that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical—it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a professor in the humanities rather than computer science. 

Let’s apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming the description implies being more emotionally driven and not particularly technical is more frequent among humanities professors, we can make reasonable guesses:

- Likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description: \( P(D|CS) \).
- Likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description: \( P(D|H) \).

Given the nature of the description, let’s estimate:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (since it is rare for computer science professors to fit this description).
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \) (since this description matches more typical traits of humanities professors).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description given:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculating \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
