To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevant information known:
- Total number of professors: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
- Prior probability of a professor being from computer science (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Prior probability of a professor being from the humanities (P(HUM)): 75/100 = 0.75

Now, we need to assess how likely Jason's description aligns with either discipline. Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, these traits are generally more associated with the humanities than with computer science.

However, let's denote:
- The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor by P(D|CS)
- The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor by P(D|HUM)

Assuming:
- P(D|CS) = 0.1 (since traits described are less common in computer science)
- P(D|HUM) = 0.9 (since traits described are more common in humanities)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability, P(CS|D):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \times P(HUM) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Here is the formatted answer:
{"probability": "0.036"}
