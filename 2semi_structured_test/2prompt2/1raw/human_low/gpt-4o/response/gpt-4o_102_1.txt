To solve this problem, we need to use Bayesian reasoning which involves updating our prior beliefs with new evidence provided by the description of Jason.

First, our prior belief about whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor is based on the sample sizes provided:

- 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
- 75 out of 100 professors are from the humanities.

This gives us the prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the given description for each type of professor. Given that Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a technical computer science professor. This is an intuitive judgment. For the purposes of this calculation, let’s assign some hypothetical plausible likelihoods based on this intuition:
- P(description | CS) = 0.2 
- P(description | Hum) = 0.8

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

P(CS | description) = [P(description | CS) * P(CS)] / [P(description | CS) * P(CS) + P(description | Hum) * P(Hum)]

Plugging in the values:
P(CS | description) = [0.2 * 0.25] / [0.2 * 0.25 + 0.8 * 0.75]
                    = [0.05] / [0.05 + 0.6]
                    = 0.05 / 0.65
                    ≈ 0.0769

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.077.
