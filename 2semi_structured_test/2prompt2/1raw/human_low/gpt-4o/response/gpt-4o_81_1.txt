To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to utilize Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:

1. The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is from computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is from the humanities:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need clues from the description to update these priors. The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted, and is passionate but not particularly technical. These traits might be considered more typical of humanities professors than computer science professors. 

Let's hypothetically assume:
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)

If we treat these likelihoods based on subjective judgment and the given description, it is reasonable to assume:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.9 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

We need to calculate the overall probability of the description:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
