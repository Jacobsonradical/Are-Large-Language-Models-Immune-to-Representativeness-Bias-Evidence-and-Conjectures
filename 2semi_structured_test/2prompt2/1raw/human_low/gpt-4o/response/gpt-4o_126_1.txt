To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the priors:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The prior probability \( P(A^C) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
\[ P(A^C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description. Due to Jason being "not particularly technical" and more emotionally driven, it might be relatively low for a computer science professor. Let's assume this probability is 0.1 as an estimate.

- \( P(B|A^C) \) is the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description. Given Jason's creative and imaginative traits, it is probably higher for a humanities professor. Let's assume this probability is 0.7 as an estimate.

Finally, we can calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^C) \cdot P(A^C) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0455 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0455.
