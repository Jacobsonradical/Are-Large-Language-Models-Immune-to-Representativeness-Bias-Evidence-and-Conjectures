To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the description.

First, let’s set up the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \))**:
   This is a bit more challenging to determine exactly without additional information, but it accounts for the probability of getting a description like Jason's out of the total sample. For now, we’ll use it in the formula abstractly.

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**:
   This probability is more qualitative but based on the description and provided characteristics, Jason appears to fit more of a humanities type (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). For the sake of the argument, let's propose that the likelihood of a computer science professor fitting Jason's description (\( P(B|CS) \)) is relatively low, say 0.1 (10%). This is a subjective estimate, as exact figures are not available.

4. **Likelihood of Being in Humanities (\( P(B|H) \))**:
   Should fit Jason’s description well, let's give it a high value, say 0.8 (80%).

Given our subjective estimates:

- \( P(B|CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|H) = 0.8 \)
- The prior \( P(A) = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability of a humanities professor \( P(H) = 0.75 \)

Using Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.6} \]

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]

\[ P(CS|B) = 0.04 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.04.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.04"}
