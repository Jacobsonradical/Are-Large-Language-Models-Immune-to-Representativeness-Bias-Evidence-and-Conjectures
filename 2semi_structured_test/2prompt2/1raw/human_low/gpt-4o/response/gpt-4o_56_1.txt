To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided fits Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

We know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring), it seems more aligned with typical humanities traits than computer science traits. However, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \): The description is less likely to fit a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \): The description is more likely to fit a humanities professor.

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
