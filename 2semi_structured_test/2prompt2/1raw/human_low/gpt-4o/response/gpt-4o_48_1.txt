To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant information:

- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \(P(CS)\), is \(25/100 = 0.25\).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \(P(H)\), is \(75/100 = 0.75\).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \(P(CS|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description.

Similarly, the probability of being in the humanities given the description is:

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \(P(H|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.
- \(P(D|H)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are interested in the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\). To find it, we need \(P(D)\), which is given by the total probability theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description, let's consider the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Jason's description seems more characteristic of humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). Let's assume:

- \(P(D|CS) \approx 0.1\): There's a low likelihood that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.9\): There's a high likelihood that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

Now we can calculate \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can find \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
