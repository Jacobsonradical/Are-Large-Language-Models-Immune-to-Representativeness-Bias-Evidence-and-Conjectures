To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to employ Bayesian reasoning. The key here is to consider both prior probabilities and the likelihood based on the description.

Here are the details we have:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(CS) \): Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(H) \): Probability Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- Likelihood based on the description:
  - Suppose \( P(Description | CS) = L(CS) \)
  - Suppose \( P(Description | H) = L(H) \)

Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical, it seems more consistent with traits typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, we assume:

  - \( L(CS) \) is lower  
  - \( L(H) \) is higher

However, for the sake of simplicity and without specific values, let's assume:
  - \( L(CS) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood of him being a computer science professor)
  - \( L(H) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood of him being a humanities professor)

We use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \(P(CS|Description)\):

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Where \(P(Description)\):

\[
P(Description) = P(Description|CS) * P(CS) + P(Description|H) * P(H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(Description) = (0.2 * 0.25) + (0.8 * 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now, calculate \(P(CS|Description)\):

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.2 * 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.077.
