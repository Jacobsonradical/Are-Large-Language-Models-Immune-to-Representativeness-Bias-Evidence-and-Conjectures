To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
     \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to consider how likely a description like Jason's is given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Jason's description includes traits like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which might be more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. However, we need specific likelihood values to proceed accurately.
   
Let's assume that professional psychologists commonly find Jason's traits more likely among humanities professors. For illustration:
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \)

3. **Normalization (Total Probability of the Description):**
   - Using the law of total probability, we calculate the total probability of getting a description like Jason's:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
     \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Finally, using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
