To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs about whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's outline the known prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to make reasonable assumptions about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which are the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

Given the description:
- "Imaginative, creative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical" seems more aligned with common stereotypes about humanities professors than computer science professors.

So, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability of description given computer science) is relatively low, say 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability of description given humanities) is relatively high, say 0.7.

Now, using the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0455 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.0455 or about 4.55%.

So, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.0455"}
