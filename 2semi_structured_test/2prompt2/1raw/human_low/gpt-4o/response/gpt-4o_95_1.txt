To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates and the description provided. The base rates indicate that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, giving us prior probabilities of 0.25 and 0.75 respectively.

Given the description, Jason seems to fit archetypal traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than those typically associated with computer science professors. The traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical align more closely with the humanities field.

We can apply Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probabilities with the likelihood derived from the description. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 0.25
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 0.75
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor 
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description

Without specific values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), but reasoning that the description fits much better with a humanities professor, we might assume \( P(D|H) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|CS) \).

Let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood as the traits match well). Assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood as the traits do not match well).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values we assumed:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
