To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want to find, i.e., the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood, i.e., the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given the numbers in the study, we can work through this step by step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
   \[
   P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**: The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: This is the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor. Since Jason’s description suggests traits more often associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), this likelihood might be low.

   - Let's assume \( P(B|\text{CS Professor}) = 0.1 \).

4. **Complement Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \)**: This is the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.
   - Given the match of Jason's traits with those of humanities professors, let's assume \( P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) = 0.7 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the overall probability of the description, and it can be found using the law of total probability.
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(B|\text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor})
   \]
   Substituting the numbers:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55
   \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**: Finally, we use Bayes’ theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
   \[
   P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.0455
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is about 0.0455.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0455"}
