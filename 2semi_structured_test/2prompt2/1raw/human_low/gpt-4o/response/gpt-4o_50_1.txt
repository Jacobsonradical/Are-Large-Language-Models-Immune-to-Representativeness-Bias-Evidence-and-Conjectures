In this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our probability. Here's the information:

- The number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- The number of humanities professors (H): 75

Prior probabilities based on the sample:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Let's denote the description provided as \(D\).

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) to find \(P(D)\), which we then use to compute \(P(CS|D)\).

Given the description of Jason, if we assume that the traits described are significantly more common among humanities professors than computer science professors, we can hypothesize:
- \(P(D|CS) = \text{a low value, indicative of a low probability that a computer science professor fits this description}\)
- \(P(D|H) = \text{a higher value, indicative of a higher probability that a humanities professor fits this description}\)

Since the description fits more typical characteristics of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, passionate but not technical), let's approximate:
- \(P(D|CS) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.9\)

Now, we calculate \(P(D)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
