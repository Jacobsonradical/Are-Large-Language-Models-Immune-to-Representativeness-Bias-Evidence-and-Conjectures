To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the prior probability and the likelihood of the observed data to the posterior probability.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- So, the prior probabilities are:
  - P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
  - P(Humanities) = 75/100 = 0.75

We need to estimate the likelihoods based on the given description of Jason. Suppose we denote the likelihood of observing a description like Jason's among computer science professors as \( P(D|CS) \) and among humanities professors as \( P(D|Humanities) \).

Without explicit data, if we assume that the detailed descriptions align more with the traits commonly associated with professors in the respective fields, it is reasonable to assume that the description provided (being imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, etc.) is more likely for humanities professors than for computer science professors. 

Let's assign some plausible likelihoods for convenience:
- P(D|CS) = 0.1 (Jason's description is not very typical for computer science professors)
- P(D|Humanities) = 0.9 (Jason's description is very typical for humanities professors)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.7
\]

Now calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.04.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.04"}
