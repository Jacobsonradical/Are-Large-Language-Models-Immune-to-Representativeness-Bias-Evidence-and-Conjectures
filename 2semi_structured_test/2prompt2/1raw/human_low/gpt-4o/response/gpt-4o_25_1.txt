To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated mathematically as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason given in the problem.

Let's break down the components required:

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(\text{{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **P(B|A)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Without specific data to quantify this, we can assume that the description fits more closely with typical humanities professors' traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). We assign a relatively low likelihood. For the sake of illustration, let's estimate:
   \[
   P(\text{{description}}|\text{{CS}}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **P(B|¬A)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor). We'll approximate this as higher due to the described traits:
   \[
   P(\text{{description}}|\text{{Hum}}) = 0.8
   \]

4. **P(B)**: The total probability of the description occurring. This can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(\text{{description}}) = P(\text{{description}}|\text{{CS}}) \cdot P(\text{{CS}}) + P(\text{{description}}|\text{{Hum}}) \cdot P(\text{{Hum}})
   \]
   Since:
   \[
   P(\text{{Hum}}) = 1 - P(\text{{CS}}) = 0.75
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   P(\text{{description}}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625
   \]

Now plugging the values back into Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(\text{{CS}}|\text{{description}}) = \frac{P(\text{{description}}|\text{{CS}}) \cdot P(\text{{CS}})}{P(\text{{description}})} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
\[
\boxed{0.04}
\]

So, the answer in the requested format is:

```json
{"probability": "0.04"}
```
