To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (likelihood).
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description (normalizing constant).

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- The number of computer science professors in the sample: 25 out of 100, so \( P(CS) = 0.25 \).
- The number of humanities professors in the sample: 75 out of 100, so \( P(H) = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assign the likelihoods based on these qualitative assessments. We can reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
