Before responding to the problem, let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. 

Let:
- \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D|C) P(C) + P(D|H) P(H)} \]

Let's assign the respective probabilities based on the sample:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group. Given that there are 25 computer science professors out of 100, we have \( P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group. Given that there are 75 humanities professors out of 100, we have \( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Next, we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Based on the description provided ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical"), it seems more aligned with common stereotypes of humanities professors compared to computer science professors. Without exact likelihood values, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.3 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.225} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.1 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
