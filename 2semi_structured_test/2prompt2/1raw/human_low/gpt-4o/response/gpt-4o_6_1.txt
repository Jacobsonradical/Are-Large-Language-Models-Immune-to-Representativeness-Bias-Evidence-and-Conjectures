To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is a mathematical method for determining conditional probability. The theorem can be written as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of B.

Let's define the terms:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description matches Jason.

We are asked for \( P(A|B) \).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \).

Since Jason's description suggests he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," and "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," these traits are likely more common among humanities professors. Therefore, we will reasonably assume that:

- The probability of such a description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A) \), is lower.
- The probability of such a description given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(B|\neg A) \), is higher.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) might be 0.1 (10% if he's a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) might be 0.9 (90% if he's a humanities professor).

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.0357"} \]
