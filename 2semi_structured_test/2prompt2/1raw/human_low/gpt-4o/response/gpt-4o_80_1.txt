To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( C \) and the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( H \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors, so \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- There are 75 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the likelihoods. Based on the description, Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) seem more aligned with humanities professors than with computer science professors. 

If we make some reasonable assumptions based on the description:
- Suppose \( P(D|C) \), the probability that a computer science professor has these traits, is 0.1.
- Suppose \( P(D|H) \), the probability that a humanities professor has these traits, is 0.9.

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately 0.036.

Here is the answer in the required format:
