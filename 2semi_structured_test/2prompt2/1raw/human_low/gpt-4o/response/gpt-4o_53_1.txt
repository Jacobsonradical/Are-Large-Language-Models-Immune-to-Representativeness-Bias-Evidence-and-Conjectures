To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we need to take into account the prior probabilities, the likelihoods of his profile fitting each group, and the evidence provided by his description.

Here are the given pieces of information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we must consider the likelihoods. Let \(D\) be the event that a professor has Jason's profile. We need to compare the likelihood of Jason's profile given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D | \text{CS})\)) and given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D | \text{H})\)).

Since Jason's characteristics ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, not particularly technical") are more stereotypically aligned with the humanities field rather than computer science, we can assume that:

- \(P(D | \text{CS})\) is relatively lower.
- \(P(D | \text{H})\) is relatively higher.

For simplicity and without specific numerical likelihoods provided, let's assume:
- \(P(D | \text{CS}) = 0.1\)
- \(P(D | \text{H}) = 0.9\)

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
