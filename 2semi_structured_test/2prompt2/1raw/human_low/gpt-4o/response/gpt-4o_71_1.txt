To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the prior probabilities and the likelihood based on the description given.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (prior) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor (prior) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Jason's description suggests that he is creative, imaginative, and passionate, but "not particularly technical." This set of traits aligns more closely with common perceptions of humanities professors than computer science professors.

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we can simplify it to consider the priors and relative likelihoods:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities} \mid \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Given the description matches what we would expect more from a humanities professor, the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \).

While exact numbers for these likelihoods are not provided, we can reasonably infer based on the description that the probability Jason is a humanities professor is quite high compared to him being a computer science professor.

Thus, the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor will be much lower than the prior probability of 0.25.

Given the strong alignment with a humanities profile, let's assume a more significant likelihood ratio favoring humanities over computer science, say 1:4. 

New posterior for CS would be:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75 \times 4} = \frac{0.25}{3.25} \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
