To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

We are given:

- Number of computer science professors (\(CS\)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

We are trying to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(CS\)) given his description (\(D\)).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(CS)\)**:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \(P(H)\)**:
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\)**:
   Based on the description provided, Jason appears to have traits that might be characteristic of someone in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.) rather than typical traits of someone in computer science. Therefore, we will assign probabilities to these likelihoods based on these qualitative judgments. 

   Let's estimate:
   \[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \] (lower probability as the description doesn't strongly indicate typical computer science traits)
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \] (higher probability as the description matches more closely with typical humanities traits)

4. **Total Probability \(P(D)\)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
