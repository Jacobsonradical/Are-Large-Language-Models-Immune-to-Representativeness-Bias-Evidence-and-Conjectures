To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability of the description, \( P(D) \), can be broken into two parts:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to make assumptions about \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) based on the description which states Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. This description aligns more closely with a humanities professor and less with a computer science professor.

Let's assume the following probabilities based on the typical nature of these traits:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability because the description does not fit the typical profile of a technical CS professor)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability because the description fits well with the profile of a humanities professor)

We can then compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
