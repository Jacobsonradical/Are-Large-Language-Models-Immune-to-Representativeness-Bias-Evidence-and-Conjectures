To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is formulated as follows:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), the probabilities of seeing the description given that the professor is in computer science or humanities. Based on Jason's description, he appears to be more aligned with characteristics typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical). Therefore, we can reasonably assume that:

- \( P(D | CS) \) would be relatively low.
- \( P(D | H) \) would be relatively high.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \)

Now, using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.04 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is 0.04.

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.04"}
