To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps in finding the posterior probability given the prior probability and the likelihood. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the problem in terms of Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   - \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(D\)).
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
   - \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description (\(D\)).

2. **Calculate the prior probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Estimate the likelihoods**:
   - Based on the given description, Jason seems to match a profile more common in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.), and less likely in computer science.

   We can reasonably estimate:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) (likelihood of such a profile being a computer science professor) to be low, say 0.1.
   - \( P(D|H) \) (likelihood of such a profile being a humanities professor) to be higher, say 0.9.

4. **Calculate the total probability \(P(D)\)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|D) = \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Therefore, our answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
