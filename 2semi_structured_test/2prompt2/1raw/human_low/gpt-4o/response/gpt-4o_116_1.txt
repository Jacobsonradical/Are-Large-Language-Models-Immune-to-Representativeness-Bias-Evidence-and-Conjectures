To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \): Posterior probability that the professor is from computer science given the description.

Here, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since Jason's characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, not particularly technical) seem more aligned with the humanities than computer science, we can assume the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). For simplicity, letâ€™s assert \( P(D|CS) \) is lower and \( P(D|H) \) is higher. 

Assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) = 0.1 (low probability because the description is less typical for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \) = 0.9 (high probability because the description is more typical for a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} 
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
