To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event characterized by the description of Jason.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- The probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description occurring given each type of professor. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:
- There's a certain probability \(P(B|CS)\) that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
- There's a certain probability \(P(B|H)\) that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

Given the description, Jason seems more closely aligned with typical characteristics we might expect more frequently in humanities professors. Therefore, we might assume \(P(B|CS)\) to be relatively low compared to \(P(B|H)\).

For the sake of a simple example, let's assume:
- \(P(B|CS) = 0.1\) (Since Jason doesn't fit the typical technical stereotype).
- \(P(B|H) = 0.4\) (Since the description fits more closely with traits valued in the humanities).

To find \(P(B)\), the probability of the description occurring, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.3 = 0.325 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(CS|B) \):
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:
