To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description is provided, and we need the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group given this description.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the given description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description being observed.

First, we will evaluate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without specific data on how likely the traits described are among computer science vs. humanities professors, we would estimate \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood of description given computer science) and \( P(B|H) \) (likelihood of description given humanities) based on typical stereotypes. Since Jason is "not particularly technical" and enjoys reading and exploring, these are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors, giving us reason to believe \( P(B|H) \) is higher.

However, since we do not have exact probabilities, we can utilize the subjective approach. Let's assume:
\[ P(B|CS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(B|H) = 0.8 \]

Now calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769.
