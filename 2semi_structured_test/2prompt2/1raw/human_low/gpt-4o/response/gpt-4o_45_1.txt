To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's outline the prior probabilities, the likelihood of the description given the field, and then use Bayes' formula to compute the posterior probability.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   Thus:
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given each discipline. A creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven individual who is not particularly technical sounds more aligned with a humanities profile than with a computer science profile. Letâ€™s set these estimated likelihoods as follows:
   - \( P(description \mid CS) = 0.2 \) (since it's less likely to match a computer scientist)
   - \( P(description \mid Hum) = 0.8 \) (since it's more likely to match a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(description) = P(description \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(description) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(description) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

   Now, calculate the posterior:
   \[
   P(CS \mid description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} = \frac{5}{65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.
