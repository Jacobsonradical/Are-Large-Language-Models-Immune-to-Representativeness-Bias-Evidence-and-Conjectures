To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

The description indicates that Jason is "not particularly technical," which seems more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Therefore, we can assume that \( P(D|H) \) is likely higher than \( P(D|C) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.077"} \]
