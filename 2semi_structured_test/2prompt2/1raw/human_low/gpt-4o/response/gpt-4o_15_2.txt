To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Number of computer science professors = 25
   - Number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total professors = 100

   Therefore,
   - Prior probability of being a computer science professor, P(CS) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Prior probability of being a humanities professor, P(HUM) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   The description of Jason suggests that he is creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

   Let's denote:
   - P(Description|CS) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - P(Description|HUM) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

   Since the description fits the profile of a humanities professor better, let's assign the following likelihoods:
   - P(Description|CS) ≈ 0.1
   - P(Description|HUM) ≈ 0.9

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D):
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where,
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0357.
