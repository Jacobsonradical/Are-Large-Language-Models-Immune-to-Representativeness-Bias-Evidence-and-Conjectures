To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description and the initial distribution of the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let’s define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of the description.

Given data:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
Based on the description elements such as "not particularly technical," "creative and imaginative," and "emotionally driven," it is reasonable to assume that these traits are more aligned with the humanities than computer science. Therefore, \( P(D | H) \) should be higher than \( P(D | CS) \).

While exact figures for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) cannot be determined without additional data, let's hypothesize estimates based on the description. Assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (as the description seems less likely for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (as the description seems more likely for a humanities professor)

Now, we use Bayes’ Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.077.

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.077"}}
\]
