To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event described by Jason's profile.

**Step 1: Calculate the Prior Probabilities**
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(HUM) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

**Step 2: Estimate the Likelihoods**
- \( P(B|CS) \): The probability that Jason has the described traits given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|HUM) \): The probability that Jason has the described traits given he is a humanities professor.

Based on Jason's description, it seems he possesses traits more commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) and is specifically described as not particularly technical, which is less common among computer science professors.

Letâ€™s assume for this problem:
- \( P(B|CS) = 0.1 \) (small likelihood as the described traits are less common for computer science professors).
- \( P(B|HUM) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood as the described traits are more common for humanities professors).

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Probability \( P(B) \)**
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

**Step 4: Apply Bayes' Theorem**
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036 (or 3.57%).

So the final result is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
