To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I'll use Bayesian reasoning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of a professor being from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of a professor being from humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in each category. Often, this is subjective or based on given data, which in this problem, we have to make an educated guess about based on the description.

   Given the description:
   - Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical.
   - These are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.
   
   For illustrative purposes, let's assume:
   - Likelihood of the description for a humanities professor \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.80 \)
   - Likelihood of the description for a computer science professor \( P(Description | CS) = 0.10 \)

3. **Posterior Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
   
   Bayes' Theorem is:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   
   Where \( P(Description) \) is calculated as:
   \[
   P(Description) = (P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)) + (P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum))
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.10 \times 0.25) + (0.80 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = 0.025 + 0.60 = 0.625
   \]
   
   Finally, the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.10 \times 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.04.

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.04"}
