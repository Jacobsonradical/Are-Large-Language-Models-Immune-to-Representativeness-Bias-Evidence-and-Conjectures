To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS|D)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability we are looking for).
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description being observed.

We start with the priors and basic probabilities from the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

So:
\[P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]
\[P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

Next, we evaluate \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), which are the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. This requires some judgment based on the description provided:

- Jason is described as "creative", "imaginative", "emotionally driven", "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring", "gifted and passionate" but "not particularly technical". This description seems to align more closely with the general characteristics often attributed to the humanities professors rather than computer science professors who are often more technical.

For the sake of calculation, let's make reasonable judgments:
- Assume \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\) (a lower probability as the description doesn't fit well with typical computer science profile).
- Assume \(P(D|H) = 0.8\) (a higher probability as the description fits well with typical humanities profile).

We need \(P(D)\), which we can find using the law of total probability:
\[P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)\]
\[P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65\]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
