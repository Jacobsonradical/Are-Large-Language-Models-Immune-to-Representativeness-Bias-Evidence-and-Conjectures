To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the personality description, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can do the calculation step by step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Suppose we let \( D \) represent the given description. We need the probability of the description given the professor is in computer science \( P(D|CS) \) and the probability of the description given the professor is in humanities \( P(D|H) \).
   - Based on the description, Jason doesn't seem particularly technical and exhibits traits that are often more associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven). Therefore, we might assign a relatively low \( P(D|CS) \) and a high \( P(D|H) \).

   Let's assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (since it matches traits less common in computer science)
   - \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (since it matches traits common in humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' Theorem: \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]

   - Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
     \]

   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
     \]

   - Now calculating the posterior probability:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
     \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Here is the answer in the required format:
