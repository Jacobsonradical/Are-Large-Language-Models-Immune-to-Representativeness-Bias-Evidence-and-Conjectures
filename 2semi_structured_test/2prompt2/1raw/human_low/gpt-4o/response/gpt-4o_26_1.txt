To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

First, let’s identify the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we have to consider the likelihood of Jason's personality description given his field of expertise. While we don't have precise numbers for these likelihoods, we can make some educated guesses:

- \( P(E|CS) \): The likelihood of Jason's traits if he is a computer science professor. Given that Jason is described as "not particularly technical" and emotionally driven, this may be relatively low. Let’s denote this as \( L_{CS} \).

- \( P(E|H) \): The likelihood of Jason's traits if he is a humanities professor. Given the more creative and imaginative description, this is probably higher. Let’s denote this as \( L_{H} \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description \( E \), which can be decomposed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the known probabilities:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{L_{CS} \cdot 0.25}{L_{CS} \cdot 0.25 + L_{H} \cdot 0.75} \]

Given that Jason’s traits seem more aligned with what we might expect from a humanities professor, let's assume \( L_{H} \) is significantly higher than \( L_{CS} \). For instance, let’s assign some hypothetical values:

Suppose \( L_{CS} = 0.2 \) and \( L_{H} = 0.8 \).

Plugging in these values:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]

\[ P(CS|E) \approx 0.0769 \]

This implies that the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science faculty is approximately 0.077.

Therefore, the answer should be:

{"probability": "0.077"}
