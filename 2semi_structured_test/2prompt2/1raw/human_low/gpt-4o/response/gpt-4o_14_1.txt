First, we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (what we're looking for).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's first define the individual probabilities:

- The prior probability \( P(A) \) of being a computer science professor, which is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors: 
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The prior probability of being a humanities professor (since there are only two possible categories, computer science or humanities): 
  \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without specific data on the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \), we make an educated assumption based on the descriptive traits provided. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical, which seems more aligned with humanities than computer science.

Assume the following heuristic likelihoods based on qualitative matching of traits:
- \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood of the description given computer science) is low, say \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(B|H) \) (likelihood of the description given humanities) is higher, say \( 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.04 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is about 0.04.

Here is the formatted answer:
