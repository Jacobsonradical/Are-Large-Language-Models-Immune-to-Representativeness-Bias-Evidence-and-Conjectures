To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the posterior probability to the prior probability and the likelihood of the observed data given different hypotheses.

Here's a summary of the relevant information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
  
Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, let's consider the description of Jason which suggests he is more inclined towards imaginative, emotional, and non-technical traits, a profile that may be more common in humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let's use:
- \( P(D | CS) \) = probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (assume to be low, say 0.1)
- \( P(D | H) \) = probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (assume to be higher, say 0.9)

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
