To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem incorporates prior probabilities and the likelihood of the given evidence.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that Jason is from computer science (CS), \( P(\text{CS}) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that Jason is from humanities (H), \( P(\text{H}) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need to estimate the likelihood that a professor from each field matches Jason's description. This part can be somewhat subjective, but typically, we might assume the following:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \): The likelihood that a computer science professor matches Jason's description
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \): The likelihood that a humanities professor matches Jason's description

Given the provided description, it's more likely that Jason's traits align with those typically associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) rather than computer science professors. Thus, we might reasonably set:

   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Posterior Probability**:

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Substitute in the values:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now, the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is approximately 0.0769 or about 7.69%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
