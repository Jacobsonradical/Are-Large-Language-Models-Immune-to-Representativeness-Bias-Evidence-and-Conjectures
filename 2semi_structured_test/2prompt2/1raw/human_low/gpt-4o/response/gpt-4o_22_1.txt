To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The equation for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description being given if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of choosing a computer science professor (before knowing the description).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's assign the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) because 25 out of the 100 professors are computer science professors.
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) for humanities professors.

Next, consider \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \).

**Given his description:**
- Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" which aligns more closely with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given the description's alignment with humanities traits:
- Assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (a rough estimate as computer science professors are less likely to have these traits).
- Assume \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \) (since these traits are more common among humanities professors).

Now, calculate the normalizing constant \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
