Given the description of Jason, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS professors). 

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( B \) is the description given (Jason is a 36-year-old, divorced man with no children who is creative and imaginative, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical).

Let's determine each component:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability of Jason being a CS professor.
    - There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
    - So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **\( P(B|A) \)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
    - We need to estimate how likely it is for a CS professor to fit the description. Given the traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it is generally less likely for a CS professor compared to a humanities professor. Suppose this probability is quite low, let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (this is an assumed probability, slightly subjective but assumed low).

3. **\( P(B|A^c) \)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
    - Given the description, it's more likely that a humanities professor fits this description. Suppose this probability is higher. Let's assume \( P(B|A^c) = 0.7 \) (again, this is an assumed probability subject to interpretation but assumed significantly higher).

4. **\( P(B) \)**: The total probability of the description. This can be obtained using the law of total probability:
    \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
    \[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.7 \cdot 0.75 \]
    \[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
    \[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0455 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0455. Rounding to two decimal places:

{"probability": "0.05"}
