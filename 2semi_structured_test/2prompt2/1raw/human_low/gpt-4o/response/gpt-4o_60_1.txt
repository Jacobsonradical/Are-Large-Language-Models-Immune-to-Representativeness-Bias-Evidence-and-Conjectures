To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, let's define the probabilities we need:
- \( P(CS) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): the overall probability of Jason's description.

From the setup of the study:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To determine \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we think about the description and how likely it is to fit computer science vs. humanities professors. Jason's description suggests he is more likely to be in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

While exact probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) aren't provided, we can reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly lower than \( P(D|H) \).

Let's assume some rough estimates:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (since it is less likely for a computer science professor to have this description)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.5 \) (since it is more likely for a humanities professor to have this description)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.0625 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.0625"}
