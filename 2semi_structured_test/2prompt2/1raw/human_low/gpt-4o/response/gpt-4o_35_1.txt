To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need the following probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability of being a Computer Science Professor (P(CS)):**
   Let's denote:
   - Number of Computer Science Professors = \( n_{CS} = 25 \)
   - Number of Humanities Professors = \( n_{H} = 75 \)
   
   Thus, the prior probability of being a Computer Science professor is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{CS} + n_{H}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   
2. **Prior Probability of being a Humanities Professor (P(H)):**
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{n_{H}}{n_{CS} + n_{H}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   
3. **Likelihood of the description given that the person is a Computer Science Professor (P(D|CS)) and given that the person is a Humanities Professor (P(D|H)):**
   Without concrete data on the distributions of traits, we rely on typical perceptions and stereotypes. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical. Based on stereotypes, these traits seem more aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors.

   Letâ€™s assume some reasonable estimations:
   - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (less likely given his description)
   - \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (more likely given his description)
   
4. **Posterior Probability (P(CS|D)):**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.0769"}}
\]
