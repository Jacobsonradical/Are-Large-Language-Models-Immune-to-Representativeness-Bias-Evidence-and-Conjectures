To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the observed evidence.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Prior probability (P(CS) for computer science): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Prior probability (P(H) for humanities): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Assess the likelihood of the description fitting each category.
   - Jason's profile (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical) aligns more strongly with humanities than with computer science.
   - Let's assign rough likelihoods based on the description given.
     - P(Description | CS) may be considered quite low; let's take it as 0.1.
     - P(Description | H) may be much higher; let's approximate it to be 0.9.

3. **Application of Bayesâ€™ Theorem:**
   - Formula: 
     \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
   - Where \( P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H) \)

   Compute \( P(Description) \):
   \[ P(Description) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(Description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

   Now, compute \( P(CS | Description) \):
   \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, given the provided description and using the reasoning from Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.036"} \]
