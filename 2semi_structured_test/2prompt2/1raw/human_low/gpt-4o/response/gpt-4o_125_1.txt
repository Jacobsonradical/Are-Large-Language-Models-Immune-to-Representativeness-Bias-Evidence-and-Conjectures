To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability in light of new evidence. Here's the theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

From the problem, we have:
- 25 computer science professors.
- 75 humanities professors.
- Total = 100 professors.

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given Jasonâ€™s description, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \). Based on the given description, Jason does not seem to exhibit traits strongly aligned with technical fields such as computer science, which might suggest a higher likelihood that he is in the humanities. For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

Now, we need to compute \( P(B) \) which is:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769. In the specified format:
