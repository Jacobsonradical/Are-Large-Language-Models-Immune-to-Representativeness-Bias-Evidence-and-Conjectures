First, we need to consider the base rates for each group: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, leading to a prior probability of being a computer science professor of \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\), and a prior probability of being a humanities professor of \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we update these priors based on the given description of Jason. We assess how likely this description fits a professor in each group. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits may be more stereotypically associated with humanities professors.

If we assume the likelihood of this description fitting a computer science professor is lower, letâ€™s say 0.1, and the likelihood of it fitting a humanities professor is higher, say 0.9, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

In this formula, \(P(\text{Description})\) is a normalizer that ensures probabilities sum to 1 and is computed as:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Plug in the numbers:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \approx \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is approximately 0.036.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
