To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason having the described personality traits if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason having the described personality traits if he is not a computer science professor (i.e., if he is a humanities professor).

Based on the description, Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) appear more aligned with typical humanities professors. Therefore, \( P(B|A) \) should be lower, and \( P(B|\neg A) \) should be higher. Let's tentatively assign:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \)

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ = 0.65 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
