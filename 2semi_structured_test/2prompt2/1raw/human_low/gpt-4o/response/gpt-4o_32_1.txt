To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The base rates and given descriptions will allow us to update our prior beliefs.

First, let’s define the known probabilities:

- Prior probability that a professor is in computer science (\(P(CS)\)):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- Prior probability that a professor is in the humanities (\(P(H)\)):

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)).
Given the description, Jason seems to align more closely with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical).

Let's assume that the likelihood of such a description is:

- Given a computer science professor, \(P(D|CS)\) might be relatively low compared to given a humanities professor. Let’s assume \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\).
- Given a humanities professor, \(P(D|H)\) might be relatively high. Let’s assume \(P(D|H) = 0.9\).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(P(D)\) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Thus:

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now, substitute the values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.036"}} \] 

Returning the result in the requested format:
