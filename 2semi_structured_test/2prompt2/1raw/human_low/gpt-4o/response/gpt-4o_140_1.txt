Given the description of Jason, you can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the posterior probability that he is a computer science professor. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The provided description fits Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need the prior probabilities:

- \(P(C)\): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H)\): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need the likelihoods:

- \(P(D|C)\): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description indicates someone who is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more in line with traits often found in humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's assume:

- \(P(D|C) = 0.1\) (less likely for computer science professors)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) (more likely for humanities professors)

Lastly, we need the total probability \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.036"} \]
