To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And the probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given Jason's description, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description seems to align more closely with traits often associated with the humanities, such as creativity and emotional drive, rather than technical skills which are stereotypically linked with computer science.

We can assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \sim 0.2 \): It's plausible but less likely for a typical computer science profile.
- \( P(D|H) \sim 0.8 \): It seems to fit the humanities profile more closely.

Now we can calculate the overall probability \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.077"} \]
