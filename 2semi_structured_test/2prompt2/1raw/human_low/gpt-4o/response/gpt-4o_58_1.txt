To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's define the initial probabilities and the necessary components:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

We have the following initial numbers:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(A') \)) is:
\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We also need \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | A') \), which are the probabilities of the description fitting a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. Since the exact values are not given and we have to make a reasonable assumption based on the description and common stereotypes, let's assume the following:

Based on the description:
- Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven. He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical."

These traits might suggest a lower probability of him being a computer science professor, but not impossible. Let's assume reasonable estimates:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B | A') = 0.8 \)

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \), which is the total probability of Jasonâ€™s description:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{1}{13} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
