To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a professor of computer science given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem involves considering both the prior probability and the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in either computer science or the humanities.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**: The initial probability of selecting a computer science professor out of the total sample.
    - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
    - Therefore, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - And \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor. Since we don't have exact data on the likelihood, we can make qualitative judgments based on the description.
    - Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and not particularly technical. These traits more strongly correspond to professors in the humanities than in computer science.
    - Let's assume for the sake of illustration:
       - \( P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
       - \( P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Bayesâ€™ Theorem Application**:
    \[
    P(\text{CS}|\text{desc}) = \frac{P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{desc})}
    \]
    Where \( P(\text{desc}) \) can be calculated as:
    \[
    P(\text{desc}) = P(\text{desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{desc}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
    \]
    Plugging in the values:
    \[
    P(\text{desc}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{desc}) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
    \]

4. Finally, the posterior probability is:
    \[
    P(\text{CS}|\text{desc}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0769.
