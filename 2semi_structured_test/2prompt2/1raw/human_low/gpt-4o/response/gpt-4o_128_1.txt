To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our probabilities:

- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \).
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \).
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \).
- Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, \( P(CS|D) \).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors = 100.

So,

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' theorem is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

The difficulty here is estimating \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) without specific data. However, given Jason's description (which is creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, passionate but not technical), it is reasonable to infer that such traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors (who might be more technical).

Therefore, we can assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = k \]
\[ P(D|H) = m \]
with \( k < m \).

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) as rough estimates based on the qualitative assessment of the description.

Now,
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036, or 3.6%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
