To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's denote:
- \( X \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( Y \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The provided description.

Given the data:
- Number of computer science professors, \( n_X = 25 \)
- Number of humanities professors, \( n_Y = 75 \)
- Total number of professors, \( n = 100 \)

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(X) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Y) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The problem requires us to estimate \( P(D|X) \) and \( P(D|Y) \). Given the nature of Jason's description, it seems to be more aligned with humanities traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, etc.) rather than traits typically associated with computer science professors (technical inclinations).

For the sake of calculation, let's assume subjective values as follows:
- \( P(D|X) \approx 0.1 \) (it's quite unlikely for the description to fit a typical computer science professor)
- \( P(D|Y) \approx 0.9 \) (it's highly likely for the description to fit a typical humanities professor)

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|X) \cdot P(X) + P(D|Y) \cdot P(Y) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(X|D) = \frac{P(D|X) \cdot P(X)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(X|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(X|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(X|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.036"}
