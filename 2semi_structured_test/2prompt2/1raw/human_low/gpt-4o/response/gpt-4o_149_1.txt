To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( C \) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's determine the values for these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   
   Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore:
   \[ P(D|C) \]
   \[ P(D|H) \]

   Since exact values are not given, we can assume that the probability of this description for a humanities professor is higher. Let's assume that:
   \[ P(D|C) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.5 \]

3. **Total Probability \(P(D)\)**:
   
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.375 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.4 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.0625 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.0625"}
