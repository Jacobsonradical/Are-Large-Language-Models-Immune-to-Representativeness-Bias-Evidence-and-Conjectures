To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( B \) be the event of receiving Jason's description.

First, we need three pieces of information:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the study data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so:
  \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Since the description mentions Jason is not particularly technical and displays interests and personality traits more commonly associated with humanities, it is reasonable to assume that \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A) \).

However, without the exact probabilities, we must estimate based on typical patterns:
- Assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low due to the non-technical description.
  Let's estimate \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \).
- Similarly, assume \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively high.
  Let's estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of receiving Jason's description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.
