To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we should use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

Let's assign:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description fits Jason.

The prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We now need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which are subjective judgments based on the description. Given the description, it seems more aligned with typical humanities traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) than technical, which is more often associated with computer science.

We can subjectively estimate:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \]

Now we need to find \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description. This can be computed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0455 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.0455"} \]
