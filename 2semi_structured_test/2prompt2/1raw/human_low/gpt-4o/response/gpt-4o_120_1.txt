To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided, we can make use of Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Given Jason's description as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," etc., which aligns more with common stereotypes about humanities professors than computer science professors, let's assume the following likelihoods:
     - Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)): Let's say, conservatively, 0.2.
     - Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)): Let's say 0.8.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation** using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring among all professors: 
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substituting our values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077. 

Answer:

{"probability": "0.077"}
