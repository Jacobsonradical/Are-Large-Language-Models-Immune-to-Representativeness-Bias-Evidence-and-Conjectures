To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we calculate the probability based on the information given and the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the study.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:

- 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science. Therefore, \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities. Therefore, \(P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we assess how likely the description of Jason is for each group of professors, although specific likelihoods (\(P(Description | CS)\) and \(P(Description | HU)\)) are not given explicitly. Based purely on common stereotypes and descriptions of typical traits, "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate but not particularly technical" seems to be more aligned with humanities than with computer science.

We'll make an assumption about these likelihoods for the sake of calculation:
- Assume \(P(Description | CS) = 0.2\): a smaller number reflecting that the described traits are less common in computer science professors.
- Assume \(P(Description | HU) = 0.8\): a larger number reflecting that the described traits are more common in humanities professors.

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Where \(P(Description)\) can be calculated as:

\[
P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | HU) \times P(HU)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(Description) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75)
\]
\[
P(Description) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
