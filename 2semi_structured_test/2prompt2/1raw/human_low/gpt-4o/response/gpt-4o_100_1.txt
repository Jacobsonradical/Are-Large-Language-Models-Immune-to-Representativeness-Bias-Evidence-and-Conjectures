To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's assign some values:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given Jason's description that emphasizes creativity, imagination, and his lack of technical focus, let’s make an educated guess about the likelihood of such a description for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

- \( P(B|A) \) (probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor) might be low. Let’s estimate this as 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) is likely higher, as creativity and imagination are traits more commonly associated with the humanities. Let’s estimate this as 0.8.

Now, we can use the law of total probability to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.625 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.04 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.04.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
