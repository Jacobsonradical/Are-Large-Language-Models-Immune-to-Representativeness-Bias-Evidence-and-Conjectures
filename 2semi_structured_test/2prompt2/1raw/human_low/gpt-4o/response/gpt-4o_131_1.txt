To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

Given the prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the probability of picking a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the probability of picking a humanities professor)

Let \( D \) be the description of Jason. We're interested in the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to assess \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are the probabilities of the description given the professor's field.

Based on the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not technical. These traits seem more aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors. While it's not impossible for a computer science professor to have these traits, we might reasonably assume:

- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively low
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively high

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
