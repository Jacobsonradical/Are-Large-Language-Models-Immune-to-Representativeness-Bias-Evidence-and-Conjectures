To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesian inference allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as new evidence is presented.

Here's how we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Number of computer science professors (\( C \)): 25
   - Number of humanities professors (\( H \)): 75
   - Total number of professors (\( T \)): 100
   
   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given each class.
   - Let \( E \) be the event that Jason has the given description.
   - \( P(E|C) \) is the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

   Based on the description, "Jason is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... though not particularly technical," it seems more aligned with the typical stereotype of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Thus, let's assume:

   \[
   P(E|C) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.9
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substituting the numbers:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]
   So, the posterior probability \( P(C|E) \) is:
   \[
   P(C|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
