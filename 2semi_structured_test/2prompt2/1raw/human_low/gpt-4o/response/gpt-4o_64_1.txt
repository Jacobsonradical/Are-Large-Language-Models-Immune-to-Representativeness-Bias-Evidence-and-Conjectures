To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Description Consistency \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):**
   - Given the description indicates creativity, emotional drive, and a lack of technical inclination, these traits are commonly associated more with humanities professors than computer science professors.
   - Therefore, we can qualitatively assume that \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively low and \( P(D | H) \) is relatively high. However, without exact values, we'll estimate these probabilities based on this intuition.

4. **Total Probability \( P(D) \):**
   - \( P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \).

Let's assume estimated probabilities:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (since the traits match less with computer science professors).
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \) (since the traits match more with humanities professors).

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (P(D | CS) * P(CS)) + (P(D | H) * P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.036"} \]
