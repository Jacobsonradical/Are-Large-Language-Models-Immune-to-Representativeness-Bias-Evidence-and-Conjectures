To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's consider the description provided. We need to assess the likelihood of this description for both computer science and humanities professors:
- Since Jason is described as non-technical, creative, and imaginative, it's likely that this description is more commonly associated with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Let's assume (to simplify the problem) the following probabilities based on the description:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid A) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Say, this is quite low, like 0.2.
- \( P(\text{description} \mid B) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. Say, this is high, like 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Where

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{description} \mid B) \cdot P(B)
\]

So,

\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now,

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
\]

So the posterior probability is:

\[
\{ "probability": "0.077" \}
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
