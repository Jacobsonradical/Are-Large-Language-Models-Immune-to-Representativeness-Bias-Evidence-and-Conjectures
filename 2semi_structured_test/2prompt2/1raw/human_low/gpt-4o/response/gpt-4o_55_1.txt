To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

The event \( C \) is that Jason is a computer science professor, and the event \( H \) is that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors, \( P(C) \), is 25 out of 100.
- The number of humanities professors, \( P(H) \), is 75 out of 100.

Let \( E \) be the evidence provided by Jason's description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (which is 25/100 = 0.25),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (which is 75/100 = 0.75).

Since we have no specific \( P(E \mid C) \) and \( P(E \mid H) \) values, we must rely on judgment based on the description.

The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, enjoyment of reading and exploring, giftedness, and a lack of technical focus. These characteristics are often more strongly associated with the humanities rather than computer science, based on stereotypes.

For the sake of argument, let's assume:
- \( P(E \mid C) = 0.1 \): The probability of observing such a description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.9 \): The probability of observing such a description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Using the law of total probability for \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \times P(C) + P(E \mid H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.

Answer: {"probability": "0.036"}
