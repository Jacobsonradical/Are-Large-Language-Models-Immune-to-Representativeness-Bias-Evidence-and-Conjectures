To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can proceed:

First, we define the following:
- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a professor is in the humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \(P(CS|D)\): The posterior probability that the professor is in computer science given the description.
- \(P(H|D)\): The posterior probability that the professor is in the humanities given the description.

We have:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), which represent the probability of the description given their fields. Since Jasonâ€™s description mentions he's creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\) (low likelihood of matching a computer science profile)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) (high likelihood of matching a humanities profile)

Now we can calculate \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.
