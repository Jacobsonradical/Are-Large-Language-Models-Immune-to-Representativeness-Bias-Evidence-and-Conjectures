To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of Jason's traits fitting either a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Let's define our events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description provided for Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical. This description seems more consistent with common stereotypes of humanities professors than computer science professors.

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \): Probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \): Probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the provided description and common stereotypes, we might intuitively assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \) is relatively low, say around 0.1.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \) is relatively high, say around 0.9.

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{25}{700} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.036" \]
