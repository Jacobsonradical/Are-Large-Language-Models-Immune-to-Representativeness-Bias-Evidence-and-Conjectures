To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states: 

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.25.

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is 0.75.

Since the description indicates that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, is gifted, and passionate but not technical, it seems more likely that this description fits better with a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Let's denote \( P(B|A) \) as the likelihood of this description for a computer science professor, and \( P(B|\neg A) \) as the likelihood of this description for a humanities professor.

Assume (for the sake of calculation) that:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (less likely that a computer science professor matches this description)
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \] (more likely that a humanities professor matches this description)

The total probability \( P(B) \), or the probability of Jason's description, is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately \(0.0357\).

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.0357"}
