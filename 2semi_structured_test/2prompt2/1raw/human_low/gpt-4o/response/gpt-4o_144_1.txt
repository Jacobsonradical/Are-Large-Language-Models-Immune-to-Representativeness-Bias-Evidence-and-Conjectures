To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of seeing this description.

We are given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To use Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \). \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description if he were a computer science professor, and \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description in the sample.

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical), it is important to assess \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\text{not } A) \).

Since Jason's description does not fit the typical technical profile of a computer science professor and more closely matches common perceptions of humanities professors, we might assign probabilities as follows:

- Assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \), suggesting it's less likely Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- Assume \( P(B| \text{humanities}) = P(B|\text{not } A) \approx 0.3 \), suggesting it's more likely Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.1) \cdot (0.25)}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.1 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.1"}
