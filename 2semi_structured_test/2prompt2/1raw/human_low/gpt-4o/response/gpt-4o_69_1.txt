Sure, let's analyze the given information using Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

We are given:
- Total number of professors: 100 (25 from computer science and 75 from humanities)
- Prior probability (before seeing the description) Jason is from computer science, \(P(CS)\): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Prior probability Jason is from humanities, \(P(H)\): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need to calculate the likelihoods:
- Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \(P(D|CS)\)
- Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \(P(D|H)\)

Given the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors.

Assuming a reasonable likelihood based on described traits:
- Suppose \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\)
- Suppose \(P(D|H) = 0.9\)

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

Calculating:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Therefore, here is the answer in the requested format:
