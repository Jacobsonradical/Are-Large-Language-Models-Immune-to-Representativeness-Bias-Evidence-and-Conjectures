To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

- Let \( H_{CS} \) represent the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H_{Hum} \) represent the hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( E \) be the evidence provided by Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(H_{CS} | E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the description.

The prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H_{Hum}) \) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample:
\[ P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we don't have explicit likelihood values \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{Hum}) \), we can estimate them based on the description. 

The description of Jason suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with the humanities than with computer science, where technical skills are typically more prominent and valued.

Let's denote the likelihoods as follows:
- Let \( P(E | H_{CS}) = x \)
- Let \( P(E | H_{Hum}) = y \)

Given the nature of the description, we can hypothesize:
- \( x \) is low (since the description is not very technical)
- \( y \) is relatively high (since the description matches traits associated with the humanities)

To simplify, let's assign:
- \( x = 0.1 \)
- \( y = 0.9 \)

Using the law of total probability, we calculate \( P(E) \) as:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Now, plugging these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
