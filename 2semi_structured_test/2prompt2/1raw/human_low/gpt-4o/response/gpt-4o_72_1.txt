To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the information:

- The prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, let's consider the likelihood of Jason's description given his profession. While we don't have exact probabilities for the likelihoods, we can make an educated guess based on the description:

- Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, passionate but not particularly technical) seem more typical of humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, let's assume:
  - \( P(description | CS) \approx 0.1 \)
  - \( P(description | H) \approx 0.9 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

To calculate \( P(description) \):
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.7 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Here's the answer in the required format:
