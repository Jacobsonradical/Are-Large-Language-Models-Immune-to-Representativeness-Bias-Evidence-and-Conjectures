To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches.

First, we establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood terms \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \):

From the description, Jason seems emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and is not particularly technical, which seems more consistent with typical traits expected in the humanities field rather than computer science (which often requires technical skills and analytical abilities). Therefore, we estimate that:

- \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) might be relatively low.
- \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \) might be relatively high.

Letâ€™s use some reasonable estimates. Assume:
- \( P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.

Here is the formatted answer:
```json
{"probability": "0.0769"}
