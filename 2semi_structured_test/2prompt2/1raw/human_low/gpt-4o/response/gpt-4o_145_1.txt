To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, use Bayes' theorem. Here is how to apply Bayes' theorem in this context:

- Let \( \text{C} \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( \text{H} \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- The description provided is the evidence \( \text{E} \).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25).
- There are 75 humanities professors (P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75).

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that no specific numerical probabilities for \( P(E|C) \) and \( P(E|H) \) are provided in this problem, one needs to make a qualitative assessment based on the description. The description suggests a profile less typical for the technical fields like computer science (e.g., "not particularly technical").

A reasonable assumption would be that the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (P(E|H)) is higher than the likelihood given he is a computer science professor (P(E|C)).

For simplicity, let's assign arbitrary but reasonable estimates:
- \( P(E|C) \approx 0.1 \) (as the description doesn't fit typical traits of computer science)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.9 \) (the description fits humanities better)

Now calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Then, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
