To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula in this context is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's estimate the priors:
- \( P(CS) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \) (H is the event that the professor is in the humanities)

To proceed, we need to make assumptions about how likely the description fits with computer science professors vs. humanities professors. Given the description of Jason, attributes such as creativity, emotional drive, passion for reading and exploring, and being not particularly technical seem to align better with humanities professors.

Letâ€™s assume probabilities based on this fit:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (low probability of this description given a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (high probability of this description given a humanities professor)

Bayes' Theorem now becomes:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0357.
