To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The relevant parts of Bayes' theorem for this problem are as follows:

1. \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \(P(D|CS)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \(P(D|H)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \(P(CS|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
- Thus, \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) and \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We can reasonably infer that the description given (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) is more likely to describe someone from the humanities than computer science. Thus:

- \(P(D|CS)\) might be relatively lower, let's assume it to be, for example, 0.1.
- \(P(D|H)\) might be relatively higher, let's assume it to be, for example, 0.9.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \).

Letâ€™s calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0357.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
