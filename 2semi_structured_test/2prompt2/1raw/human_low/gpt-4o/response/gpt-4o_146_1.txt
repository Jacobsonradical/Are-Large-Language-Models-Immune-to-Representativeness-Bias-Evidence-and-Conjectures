To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A (Jason being a computer science professor) given B (the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of B.

First, let's define the necessary probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of selecting a computer science professor from the sample, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability of selecting a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Since Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, passionate but not technical) seems more aligned with the typical characteristics of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor, we set:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of this description given Jason is a computer science professor) is low. Let’s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of this description given Jason is a humanities professor) is high. Let’s assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \).

The marginal likelihood \( P(B) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077. 

Here is the answer in the required format:
