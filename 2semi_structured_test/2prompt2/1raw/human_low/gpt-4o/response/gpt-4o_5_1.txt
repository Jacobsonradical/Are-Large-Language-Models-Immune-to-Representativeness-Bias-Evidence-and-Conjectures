To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \) as the description provided

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can break this down further.

### Prior Probabilities
First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Likelihoods
Next, we need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). These are the probabilities of the description being given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

Given the description of Jason, he seems to fit more closely with traits often associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), so we might estimate:
\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.1 \] 
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.9 \]

### Marginal Probability
The marginal probability \( P(D) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

### Posterior Probability
Now, we can substitute these back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.25)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.036"}
