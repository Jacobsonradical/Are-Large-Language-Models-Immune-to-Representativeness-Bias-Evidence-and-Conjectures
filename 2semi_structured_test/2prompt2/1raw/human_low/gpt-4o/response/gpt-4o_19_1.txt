Let's apply Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

We are given:
1. 25 computer science professors (CS)
2. 75 humanities professors (H)

Our prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

Let:
- E be the event that the given description matches Jason.
- P(E | CS) = Probability that the description matches a CS professor.
- P(E | H) = Probability that the description matches a humanities professor.

We need:
1. The probability that the description is from a computer science professor given Jason's traits, which appears more typical for a humanities professor.

Given the traits, it's reasonable to assume:
- P(E | CS) might be low. Let's assume P(E | CS) = 0.2 (This is an assumption based on the description being less technical and more humanities-oriented).
- P(E | H) might be high. Let's assume P(E | H) = 0.8 (This is also an assumption based on the humanities-oriented traits).

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.08"}
