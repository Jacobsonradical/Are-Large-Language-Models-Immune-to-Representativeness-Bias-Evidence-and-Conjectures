To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (as opposed to a humanities professor) based on the given description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here, we denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given for Jason.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to determine \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). These represent the likelihoods of the description matching a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. Given the description, it seems more aligned with a humanities professor because it emphasizes creativity, imagination, travel, and emotional drive, which are often stereotypically associated with humanities rather than technical fields like computer science.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.2 \) (the likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (the likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor)

Now, we apply these to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{(0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0769.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
