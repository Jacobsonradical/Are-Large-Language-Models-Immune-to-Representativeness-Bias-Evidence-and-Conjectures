To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A (Jason being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B (the probability of the description overall).

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Also, let’s assume for simplicity that the description fits humanities professors much better due to the contextual implications that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven (traits more commonly associated with humanities than computer science). We can hypothesize approximate values for probabilities based on this description, even though these values are somewhat subjective.

Let's say:
- \( P(description|CS) = 0.2 \) (arbitrary estimate for likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description).
- \( P(description|Hum) = 0.8 \) (arbitrary estimate for likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(description) \):
\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.65 \]

Then, using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) \approx 0.077 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.077.
