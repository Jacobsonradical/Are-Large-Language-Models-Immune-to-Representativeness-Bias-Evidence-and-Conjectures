To address the question, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case:

- Hypothesis \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- Hypothesis \( H_{Hum} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, our prior probabilities are:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We now need to consider the likelihood of the evidence (description of Jason) given each hypothesis. Jason's description fits more with a humanities professor profile (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) rather than a typical profile for a computer science professor (not particularly technical).

Let's assume an estimate for the likelihoods as follows:
- \( P(Evidence | H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood since Jason's traits are not typical for CS)
- \( P(Evidence | H_{Hum}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood since Jason's traits fit well with humanities)

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem to update our probabilities:

\[ P(H_{CS} | Evidence) = \frac{P(Evidence | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(Evidence)} \]

Where \( P(Evidence) \) is the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(Evidence | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]
\[ P(Evidence) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Evidence) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(Evidence) = 0.7 \]

Now, plug in the values:

\[ P(H_{CS} | Evidence) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | Evidence) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | Evidence) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.0357 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: {"probability": "0.036"}
