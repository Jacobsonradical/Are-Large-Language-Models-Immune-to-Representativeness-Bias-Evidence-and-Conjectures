To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description.

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's compute the priors and likelihoods:
- The prior \( P(CS) = \frac{number\ of\ computer\ science\ professors}{total\ number\ of\ professors} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior \( P(Hum) = \frac{number\ of\ humanities\ professors}{total\ number\ of\ professors} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given the description, we can use subjective judgment to assume whether the description is more likely among humanities professors or computer science professors. Since Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, these traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Without exact probabilities, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (since it's less likely for a computer science professor to fit the description).
- \( P(D | Hum) = 0.8 \) (since it's more likely for a humanities professor to fit the description).

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\( P(D) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0769.

Here is the answer:
{"probability": "0.0769"}
