To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to compare the probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - Probability of selecting a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
    - Probability of selecting a humanities professor: \(P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - Based on the description, Jason does not seem particularly technical, and he has traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring) that are more typically associated with humanities professors. Therefore, let's assume:
        - Probability that a subject with Jason's description is a computer science professor: \(P(Desc | CS) = 0.1\)
        - Probability that a subject with Jason's description is a humanities professor: \(P(Desc | Hum) = 0.9\)

3. **Posterior Probability (using Bayes' Theorem)**:
    \[
    P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
    \]

    Plugging in the numbers:
    \[
    P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.700} \approx 0.0357
    \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357. 

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.0357"}
