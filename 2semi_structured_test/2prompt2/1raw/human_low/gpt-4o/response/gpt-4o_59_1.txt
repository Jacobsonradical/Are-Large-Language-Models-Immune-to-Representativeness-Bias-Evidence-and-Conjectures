To solve for the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's Bayes' theorem in this context:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description matches Jason.

We need to find:
- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

We know:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description (e.g., creative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems he aligns more with the typical traits of humanities professors than computer science professors. We'll assume that:

- The probability that a computer science professor matches this description is low, say \( P(B|A) = 0.05 \).
- The probability that a humanities professor matches this description is higher, say \( P(B|A^c) = 0.50 \).

Now, we need \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.05 \cdot 0.25) + (0.50 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.0125 + 0.375 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3875 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05 \cdot 0.25}{0.3875} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.0125}{0.3875} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.032 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.032.

Here is the final answer:

{"probability": "0.032"}
