To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define:
- \( P(CS \mid D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), which can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 
- The prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, we need to estimate \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). 

From the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. This description aligns more with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

Thus, we can make a qualitative estimate that:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is relatively high.

Assuming \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.1 \) and \( P(D \mid H) = 0.9 \):

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
