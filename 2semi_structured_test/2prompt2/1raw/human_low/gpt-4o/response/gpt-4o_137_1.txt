To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

The theorem is as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let’s define our events:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem:
- The prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we don’t have additional information about the probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \), we use the given traits to follow reasonable judgment based on stereotypes or typical profiles:
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring - these traits might lean towards a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Thus, let's assume:
  - \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (lower because the traits don't align well with the stereotype of technical fields).
  - \( P(B|H) = 0.8 \) (higher because the traits align well with humanities).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So based on the description and the assumed likelihoods, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:
{"probability": "0.0769"}
