To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new information.

First, we need the following information:
- The prior probabilities of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) and being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)):
  - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  
- The likelihood of Jasonâ€™s description given he is a computer science professor (\( P(D | CS) \)) and given he is a humanities professor (\( P(D | H) \)).

Given the description of Jason, it seems he fits more closely with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical).

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood since the description doesn't fit the typical computer science professor stereotype)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood since the description fits well with humanities traits)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, using these assumptions, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357 or 3.57%.

The answer can be represented as follows:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
