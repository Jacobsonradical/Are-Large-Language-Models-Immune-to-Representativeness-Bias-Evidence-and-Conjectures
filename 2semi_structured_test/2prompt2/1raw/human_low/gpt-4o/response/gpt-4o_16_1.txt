To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): The description given for Jason

From the problem statement, we have:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. With 25 computer science professors out of 100, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. With 75 humanities professors out of 100, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description being given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description being given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with the traits stereotypically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is low, say 0.1, reflecting that a computer science professor is less likely to have this description.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is high, say 0.9, reflecting that a humanities professor is more likely to have this description.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.
