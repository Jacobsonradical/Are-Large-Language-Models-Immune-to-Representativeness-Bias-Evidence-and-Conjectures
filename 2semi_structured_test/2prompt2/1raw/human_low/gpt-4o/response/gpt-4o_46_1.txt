Based on the description provided and taking into account the details of the study, we need to calculate the posterior probability. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's start by defining the variables and initial probabilities:

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now let's examine Jason's description to estimate the likelihoods. The description of Jason emphasizes creativity, imagination, and passion, which may be more typically associated with the humanities than with computer science. Let's denote:

- \(P(desc|CS)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(desc|Hum)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Without concrete data, we can intuitively estimate these probabilities. Based on the typical characteristics of the fields:

- Assume \(P(desc|CS) \approx 0.1\) (not particularly technical could imply a lower chance given computer science's technical nature).
- Assume \(P(desc|Hum) \approx 0.9\) (humanities professors are more often described as creative, imaginative, and passionate).

We are looking for \(P(CS|desc)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(desc)}\]

We need \(P(desc)\), the total probability of the description appearing, which is:

\[ P(desc) = P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(desc) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(desc) = 0.7 \]

Now calculate \(P(CS|desc)\):

\[ P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|desc) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
