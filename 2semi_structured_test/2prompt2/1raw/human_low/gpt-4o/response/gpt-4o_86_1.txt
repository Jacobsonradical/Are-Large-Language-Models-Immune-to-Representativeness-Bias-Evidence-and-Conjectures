To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities, \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability that Jason has his described traits given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(Desc | CS) \).
   - Probability that Jason has his described traits given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(Desc | Hum) \).

   Without explicit data on these probabilities, we can rely on general stereotypes or patterns. Given the description of Jason as an emotionally driven, creative, and non-technical individual, it is reasonable (based on stereotypes) to assume that these traits might be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. Thus:
   
   \[
   P(Desc | CS) < P(Desc | Hum)
   \]

   For example, letâ€™s assume:
   \[
   P(Desc | CS) = 0.1 \quad \text{and} \quad P(Desc | Hum) = 0.4
   \]

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   
   Calculating \( P(Desc) \):
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.3 = 0.325
   \]

   Now calculating \( P(CS | Desc) \):
   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \approx 0.077
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:
