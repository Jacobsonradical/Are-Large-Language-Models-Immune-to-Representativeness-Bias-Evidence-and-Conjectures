To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our desired posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let’s consider the prior probability \( P(A) \).

There are:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

So, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the complementary probability \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let’s consider \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. 

Based on the description provided:
- Jason is described with characteristics that are more aligned with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring), and he is "not particularly technical." Therefore, it seems more likely that he is a humanities professor.

If we roughly estimate the likelihoods as follows, given that this is based on subjective assessment:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (low probability because the description does not fit the typical profile of a computer science professor well)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \) (higher probability because the description fits the profile of a humanities professor better)

Now we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
