To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(H)\) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Let’s denote the description's characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, not technical) as \(D\).
   - We need an estimate of the likelihoods: \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\).
     - Since the description is more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors:
       - Assume \(P(D | CS) = 0.1\) (intuitively lower likelihood for computer science)
       - Assume \(P(D | H) = 0.9\) (intuitively higher likelihood for humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes’ Theorem:
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \)

4. **Normalizing Factor \(P(D)\)**:
   - \(P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)\)
   - \(P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)\)
   - \(P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675\)
   - \(P(D) = 0.7\)

5. **Calculating the Posterior**:
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.1 \times 0.25)}{0.7}\)
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357\)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:
