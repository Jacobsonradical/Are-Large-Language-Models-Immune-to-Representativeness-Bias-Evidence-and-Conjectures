To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define our hypothesis and evidence:

- Hypothesis \(\text{C}\): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- Hypothesis \(\text{H}\): Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- Evidence \(E\): The description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and not particularly technical.

We begin by considering the prior probabilities, which are the probabilities of picking a professor from each group without any additional information:
- \(P(\text{C}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we incorporate the evidence by determining how likely it is that a professor from each group would fit the given description. This requires some estimation based on the characteristics described. Let's make the reasonable assumption that the description is more likely to fit humanities professors than computer science professors:

- Let \(P(E|\text{C})\) be the probability that a computer science professor matches Jason’s description. Suppose this is relatively low as the description emphasizes non-technical and emotionally driven traits. We can estimate this as \(0.2\).
- Let \(P(E|\text{H})\) be the probability that a humanities professor matches Jason’s description. Given their field, such characteristics might be more common. We can estimate this as \(0.8\).

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(E|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C}) + P(E|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}\]

Plugging in the values:
\[P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75}\]
\[P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6}\]
\[P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769\]

Therefore, your posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.

In the requested format, the response would be:

{"probability": "0.077"}
