To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is Jason's description.

First, we must calculate each component of Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probability, \(P(A)\)**
   \[ P(A) = \text{Probability of being a computer science professor} \]
   Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability is:
   \[
   P(A\text{ being a computer science professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Similarly,
   \[
   P(A\text{ being a humanities professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood, \(P(B|A)\)**
   This is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. This is a subjective judgment based on the description provided and typical personality traits of computer science professors vs. humanities professors. Given that Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical," it seems less likely to be a typical computer science professor.

   Let's assume \(P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.1\) and \(P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.9\).

3. **Overall Evidence, \(P(B)\)**
   This is the total probability of Jason's description appearing.

   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability, \(P(A|B)\)**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

So, the answer format will be:
```json
{"probability": "0.0357"}
```
