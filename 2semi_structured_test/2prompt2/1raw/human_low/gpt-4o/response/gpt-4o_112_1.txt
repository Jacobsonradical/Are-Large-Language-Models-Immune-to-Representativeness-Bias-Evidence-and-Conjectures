To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's define these probabilities based on the problem:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we do not have specific probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we can make an informed judgment based on the description provided.

From Jason's description, which includes characteristics such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying travel, reading, and exploring, and not being particularly technical, it seems more likely that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Therefore, let's assign probabilities based on what is often seen in the humanities vs. computer science:

- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. It is likely to be lower since the description does not fit the stereotypical technical nature of computer science professionals. Let's estimate it at \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. It is likely higher since the description fits the humanities profile better. Let's estimate it at \( 0.8 \).

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65}
\]

\[
P(A|B) \approx 0.0769
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.
