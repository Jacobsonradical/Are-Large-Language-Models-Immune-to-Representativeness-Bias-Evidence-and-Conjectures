To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the base rates and the likelihood of the description given each group (computer science professors and humanities professors).

### Step 1: Base Rates

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
Thus, the base rate (prior probabilities) for each group are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

### Step 2: Likelihoods

We next need to consider how likely it is that a professor with Jason's description comes from each group. Given the information that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical, and interested in activities like traveling and reading, this profile seems to align more closely with typical perceptions of humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let’s assign the likelihood:
- \( P(description|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming lower likelihood due to less fitting technical profile).
- \( P(description|HUM) \approx 0.8 \) (higher likelihood due to fitting profile).

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem

To find the posterior probability \( P(CS|description) \), we apply Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where:
\[ P(description) = P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

So,
\[ P(description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.65 \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|description) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077.
