To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We start with the base rates and then adjust based on the given description.

First, let us define the relevant events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Description: Jason's description fits the profile given.

The base rates (prior probabilities) from the study are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to tweak these base rates with the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is in either group. Let's denote:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Without more specific data about the likelihoods, we might rely on reasonable assumptions:
- Jason exhibits traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) that seem to align more with typical humanities professors rather than with computer science professors.

For argumentâ€™s sake, if we assign these likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, plug into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:
\[ \boxed{\{\text{"probability"}: "0.077"\}} \]
