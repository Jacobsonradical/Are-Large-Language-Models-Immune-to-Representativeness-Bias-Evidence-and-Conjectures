To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason matching the given description.

We can break down the components of Bayes' theorem as follows:

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \):

This is the initial probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering his description. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability of the Complement** \( P(\neg A) \):

This is the initial probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Thus,

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood** \( P(B | A) \):

This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. The description indicates traits such as creativity, imagination, and being emotionally driven, which are considered less typical for computer science professors compared to humanities professors. Without precise numerical data, we can generally say these traits have a lower likelihood for computer science professors compared to humanities professors. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:

\[ P(B | A) = 0.1 \]

4. **Likelihood of the Complement** \( P(B | \neg A) \):

This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Since the description fits humanities professors better, we can assume a relatively higher likelihood. Let's set:

\[ P(B | \neg A) = 0.7 \]

5. **Marginal Likelihood** \( P(B) \):

This is the total probability of Jasonâ€™s description, encompassing both groups of professors. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = (P(B | A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.55 \]

Finally, applying these values to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.045 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.045, or 4.5%.
