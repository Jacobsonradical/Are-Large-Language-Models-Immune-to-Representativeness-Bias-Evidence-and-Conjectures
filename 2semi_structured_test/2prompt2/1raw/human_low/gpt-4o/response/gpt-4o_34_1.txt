To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the study, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we seek (the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description among all professors.

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor ( \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) ) and given that Jason is a humanities professor ( \( P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \) ). Since the description suggests that Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical - traits that might be more common among humanities professors - we might reasonably guess the likelihoods as follows (these are guesses in the absence of exact data):

\[ P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) = 0.9 \]

Now, we calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = 0.0357 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
