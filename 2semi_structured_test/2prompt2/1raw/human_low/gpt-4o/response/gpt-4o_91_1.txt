First, let's establish the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:

- Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the given description for each group. The description of Jason suggests characteristics commonly associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical). Given this, we assume:
- The likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|Hum) \)) is high, let's approximate it to 0.9.
- The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) is low, let's approximate it to 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probabilities:

\( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
\( P(Hum|D) = \frac{P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(D)} \)

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both equations and we only need the ratio, let's compare:

\( \text{Ratio for CS} = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \)
\( \text{Ratio for Hum} = P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675 \)

The sum for normalization:

\( \text{Sum} = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \)

Finally, the posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor is:

\( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
