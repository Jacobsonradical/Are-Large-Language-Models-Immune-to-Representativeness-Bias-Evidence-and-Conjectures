To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we should use Bayes' theorem which enables one to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. 

Firstly, let's denote the following:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{HU} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): The given description of Jason.

We aim to find \( P(H_{CS} | E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayesâ€™ theorem states:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description.

The prior probability \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H_{HU}) \), the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, is:

\[ P(H_{HU}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, for the likelihoods, intuitively judging from Jason's description:
- Jason being "not particularly technical" and "creative and imaginative" seems less typical for a computer science professor and more aligned with humanities professors.
- Therefore, we assume \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) is relatively low and \( P(E | H_{HU}) \) is relatively high given the description aligns better with humanities.

For simplicity (though these values would ideally be derived from statistical data), let's set:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(E | H_{HU}) = 0.9 \)

Now, calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{HU}) \cdot P(H_{HU}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.036" \} \]
