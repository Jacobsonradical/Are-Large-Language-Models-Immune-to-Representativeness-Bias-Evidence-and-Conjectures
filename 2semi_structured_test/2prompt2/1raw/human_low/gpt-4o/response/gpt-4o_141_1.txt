To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need to define the probabilities involved:

1. **Prior probability of a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\))**: There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Prior probability of a humanities professor (\(P(H)\))**: There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- **Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))**: This is the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- **Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))**: This is the probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description (normalizing constant):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

Given that:
- Jason's description seems to fit better with common traits that might be associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and exploring), rather than technical traits often associated with computer science.

However, without exact numerical values for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), a reasonable assumption could be made based on the descriptive fit provided.

For demonstration, let's assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\) (likelihood of the description, given Jason is a computer science professor) is lower, say, 0.1.
- \(P(D|H)\) (likelihood of the description, given Jason is a humanities professor) is higher, say, 0.9.

Now, calculate:

1. \( P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \)
   \[ P(D) =  0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

2. Using Bayes' formula:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036 (or 3.57%).

So according to the given conditions and assumptions, the answer would be:

{"probability": "0.036"}
