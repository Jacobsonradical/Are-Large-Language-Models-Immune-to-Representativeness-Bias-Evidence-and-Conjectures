The setup of the problem and the description provided suggest that Jason possesses traits that are more frequently associated with humanities professors, as he is described as imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical.

To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Let's break down the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability of choosing a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \[P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]
   - Probability of choosing a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)): \[P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let \(P(D|\text{CS})\) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \(P(D|\text{H})\) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
  
   Given that Jason's description fits the stereotype of a humanities professor more closely, we'll assume the following rough estimates:
   - \(P(D|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2\)
   - \(P(D|\text{H}) \approx 0.8\)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

   Now, compute the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.0769\).

Thus, the formatted answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.077"}
