To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), which can be computed as:
  \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the data:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we need to update our prior beliefs based on the description, an intuitive approach would be to consider the traits described and evaluate how likely they are to apply to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Since Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate though not particularly technical," these traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Assuming this, we might estimate:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is much lower than \( P(D|H) \). 

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Then we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Here's the formatted answer:
