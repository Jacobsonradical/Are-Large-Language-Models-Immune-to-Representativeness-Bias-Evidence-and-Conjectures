To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason's described personality and characteristics.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need to determine \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (the probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor).

Given the description, let's assume that the characteristics described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring) are more aligned with humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is relatively low, say 0.2 (20% chance that a computer science professor would fit the description).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is relatively higher, say 0.8 (80% chance that a humanities professor would fit the description).

Now, calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
