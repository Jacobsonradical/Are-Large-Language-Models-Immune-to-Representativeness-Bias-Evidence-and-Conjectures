To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (P(CS|D)), we can apply Bayes' Theorem. In Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Given the priors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \), we can evaluate the match between the description and typical personality traits of individuals in each field. Based on the description:

- "Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven": These traits are generally more strongly associated with humanities professors.
- "Not particularly technical": This trait is more likely to describe a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is low and \( P(D|Hum) \) is high.

For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|Hum) = 0.8 \]

Now we find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Next, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor. The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
