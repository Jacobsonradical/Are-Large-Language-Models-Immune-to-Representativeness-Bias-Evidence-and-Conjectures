To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The prior probabilities are based on the initial sample proportions, and the likelihood terms reflect how well the description fits the traits typically expected in each field.

1. Prior probability of being a computer science professor (CS):
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Prior probability of being a humanities professor (H):
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, we need to estimate:

- The likelihood Jason fits the description if he is a CS professor, \( P(D|A_{CS}) \)
- The likelihood Jason fits the description if he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|A_{H}) \)

From the description, Jason seems more fitting to the humanities profile, given the emphasis on creativity, imagination, emotional drive, passion, and lack of technical inclination.

Let's assume:

- \( P(D|A_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (low, as CS might emphasize technical skills)
- \( P(D|A_{H}) = 0.9 \) (high, matching attributes of a humanities professor)

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(D|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(D|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H})} \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A_{CS}|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Hence:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
