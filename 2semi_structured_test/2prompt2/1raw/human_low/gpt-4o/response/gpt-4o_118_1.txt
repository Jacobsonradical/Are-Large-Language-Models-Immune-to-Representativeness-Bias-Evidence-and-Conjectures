To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason being described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical.

First, we need to determine:
1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description across both groups.

First, calculate \( P(A) \):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):
- While it's challenging to know these exact probabilities without specific data, we can infer based on common stereotypes and job requirements:
  - Computer science professors may generally be perceived as more technical than humanities professors.
  - Humanities professors may more frequently match descriptors such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven.
  
For the sake of this example, let's assume \( P(B|A) \) = 0.1 (i.e., 10% of computer science professors fit this description) and \( P(B|A') \) = 0.9 (i.e., 90% of humanities professors fit this description).

Finally, calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description \( B \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.036.
