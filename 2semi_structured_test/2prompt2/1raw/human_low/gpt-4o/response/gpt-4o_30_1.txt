To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s how we can calculate it step-by-step:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): Description of Jason.

2. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(A) \): Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(B) \): Probability Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. Estimate the likelihoods:
   - \( P(D|A) \): Probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|B) \): Probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor.

Given the description, it seems more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, into reading, exploring, and not particularly technical). Therefore, we might estimate:
   - \( P(D|A) \) is lower (since these traits are less common in computer science).
   - \( P(D|B) \) is higher (since these traits are more common in the humanities).

For the sake of calculation, let’s use rough estimations:
   - \( P(D|A) \approx 0.2 \)
   - \( P(D|B) \approx 0.8 \)

4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.077 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
