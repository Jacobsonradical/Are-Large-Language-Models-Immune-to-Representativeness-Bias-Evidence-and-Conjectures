To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (B).
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description (B).

First, let's define our terms:
- Prior probability \( P(A) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, this is \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The complement probability \( P(A^c) \): the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of someone with Jason's characteristics being a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason does not seem to fit the stereotypical technical profile of a computer science professor but does fit more creative and imaginative traits often associated with the humanities.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the likelihood of someone with Jason's characteristics being a humanities professor. Given the description, this seems higher.

Given the descriptive nature of Jason's traits, let's reasonably assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood for computer science)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \) (higher likelihood for humanities)

Now we can calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{13} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.077.
