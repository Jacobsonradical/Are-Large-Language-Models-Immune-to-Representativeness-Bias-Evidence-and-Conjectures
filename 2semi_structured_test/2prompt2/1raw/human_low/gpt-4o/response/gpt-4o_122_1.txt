To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): the overall probability of the description.

From the problem statement, we know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability that a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability that a humanities professor fits this description)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0357.

Answer:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
