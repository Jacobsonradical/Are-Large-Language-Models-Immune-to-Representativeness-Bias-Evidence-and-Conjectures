To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process to follow:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of a professor being from computer science, \( P(\text{CS}) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of a professor being from the humanities, \( P(\text{H}) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \): This is subjective and estimated based on the description.
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \): This is also subjective and estimated based on the description.

Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical), it's more likely to align with the general traits often associated with humanities professors. Therefore, we might estimate:

   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) = 0.1 (low because the traits listed aren't typically associated with computer science professors)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \) = 0.9 (high because the traits listed are more commonly associated with humanities professors)

3. **Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem):**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Where,
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Converting this to a simple format:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: \text{"0.036"}
\]

So the solution is:
```json
{"probability": "0.036"}
```
