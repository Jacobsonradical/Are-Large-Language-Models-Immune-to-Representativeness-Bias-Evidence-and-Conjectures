To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- A description of Jason who does not appear particularly technical but is creative and imaginative.

Bayes' theorem informs us that the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

First, we establish prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) \: = \: P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) \: = \: \frac{25}{100} \: = \: 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) \: = \: P(\text{Jason is a humanities professor}) \: = \: \frac{75}{100} \: = \: 0.75 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason being described as creative and imaginative if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason being described this way if he is a humanities professor.

Given that the description fits more closely with the stereotypical traits of humanities professors, we might assume \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A) \). However, for simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) \: = \: \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(B) \: = \: P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Calculating \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) \: = \: 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) \: = \: 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) \: = \: 0.65 \]

Finally:
\[ P(A|B) \: = \: \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \: = \: \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \: \approx \: 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
