To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let's break these down:

1. **Prior probability \( P(CS) \)**:
   The study includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(D | CS) \)** and \( P(D | H) \)**:
   Based on the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is emotionally driven rather than technical. These traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. For simplicity, let's approximate that:
   \[ P(D | CS) = 0.10 \]
   \[ P(D | H) = 0.90 \]

3. **Total probability \( P(D) \)**:
   The total probability of the description \( P(D) \) is a weighted sum of the likelihoods over all professors:
   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(H) = 0.75 \] (since \( P(H) = 1 - P(CS) \))
   \[ P(D) = (0.10 \cdot 0.25) + (0.90 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.70 \]

Now, plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.10) \cdot (0.25)}{0.70} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.70} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.036 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
