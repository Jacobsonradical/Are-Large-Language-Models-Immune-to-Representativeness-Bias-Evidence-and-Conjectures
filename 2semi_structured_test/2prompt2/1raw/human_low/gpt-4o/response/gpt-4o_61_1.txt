To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

Let's define our events:
- \( A_c \) : Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( A_h \) : Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( B \) : The description provided (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.)

We are interested in \( P(A_c | B) \).

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - \( P(A_c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - \( P(A_h) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    
2. **Likelihoods:**
    - \( P(B|A_c) \): probability that someone fitting Jason's description is a computer science professor.
    - \( P(B|A_h) \): probability that someone fitting Jason's description is a humanities professor.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(A_c|B) = \frac{P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c)}{P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c) + P(B|A_h) \cdot P(A_h)} \]

Given the qualitative traits mentioned (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical), Jason's profile is more characteristic of humanities professors than computer science professors. If we assume these traits align roughly as follows:
- \( P(B|A_c) = 0.1 \) (since these traits are less common among computer science professors)
- \( P(B|A_h) = 0.9 \) (since these traits are more common among humanities professors)

4. **Calculating \( P(B) \):**

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c) + P(B|A_h) \cdot P(A_h) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

5. **Calculating the posterior probability \( P(A_c|B) \):**

\[ P(A_c|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_c|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_c|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
