To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we find the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \). Since the description mentions that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and is not particularly technical, it seems to align more with common stereotypes of humanities professors.

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.8 \) (since the description matches our stereotype of a humanities professor).
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.2 \) (the description contradicts our typical stereotype of a computer science professor).

Now, we calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|\text{description}) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|\text{description}) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769.
