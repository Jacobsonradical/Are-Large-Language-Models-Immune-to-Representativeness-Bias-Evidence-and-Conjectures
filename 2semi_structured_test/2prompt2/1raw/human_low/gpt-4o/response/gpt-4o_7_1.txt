To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS | Description)), we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's assign the values we know:
- The prior probability \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) since there are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
- The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) since there are 75 humanities professors.

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Hum) \). Given Jason's profile, he seems more aligned with the characteristics typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, we can make an educated guess:

- Let's assume \( P(Description | CS) \) is low, say 0.1.
- Let's assume \( P(Description | Hum) \) is relatively high, say 0.9.

To find \( P(Description) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036 or 3.57%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.036"}
