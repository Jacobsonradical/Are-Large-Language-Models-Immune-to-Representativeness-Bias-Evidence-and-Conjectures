To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a Humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a Humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be expanded as \( P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \).

First, the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to fit the profile of a Humanities professor because he is described as "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical," which are attributes that might be less common in the computer science field. However, without exact data, let’s make reasonable estimates:

- Suppose \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \) (assuming a lower likelihood given the description doesn't fit the common stereotype of CS professors).
- Suppose \( P(D|H) \approx 0.6 \) (assuming a higher likelihood given the description fits more common traits of Humanities professors).

Now applying Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{(0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.6 \times 0.75)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.45} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.0526 \).

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.0526"}
