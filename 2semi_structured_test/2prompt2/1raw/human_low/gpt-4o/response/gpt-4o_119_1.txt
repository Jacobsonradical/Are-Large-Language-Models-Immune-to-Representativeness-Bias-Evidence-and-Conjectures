The description given for Jason fits more closely with the typical personality traits associated with the humanities rather than computer science, especially considering that he is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our probabilities based on this new information.

First, we should start with the prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(Humanities)\), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Given the description, we need to consider how likely these traits are for each group. Let's assume hypothetically:
- The likelihood of such a description being for a computer science professor, \(P(description | CS)\), is 0.1 considering they are generally less described as creative and imaginative but more technical.
- The likelihood of such a description being for a humanities professor, \(P(description | Humanities)\), is 0.9 considering they are often described as creative and imaginative.

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor \(P(CS | description)\):
\[P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)}\]

Substituting the values:
\[P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
