To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how to approach the problem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \): \( 25\% \) or \( 0.25 \) (since 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \): \( 75\% \) or \( 0.75 \) (since 75 out of 100 professors are from the humanities).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Assuming that the description fits certain personality traits more commonly found in humanities professors than in computer science professors, we will assign probabilities to the likelihoods based on typical traits observed in those fields. Let's assume:
     - Probability of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \): Given the description's emphasis on creativity, imagination, and non-technical aspects, let's assume a lower likelihood of \( 0.2 \).
     - Probability of observing the description if Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D|Hum) \): Given the description's alignment with traits often found in the humanities, let's assume a higher likelihood of \( 0.8 \).

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   
   Substituting in the values:
   
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]
   
   Now calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately \( 0.0769 \).

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.0769"}}
\]
