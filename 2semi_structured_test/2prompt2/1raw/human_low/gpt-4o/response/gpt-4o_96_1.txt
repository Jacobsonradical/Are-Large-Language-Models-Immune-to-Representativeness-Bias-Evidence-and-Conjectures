To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A' \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description fits Jason.

From the problem:
- Number of computer science professors (\(N_{CS}\)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\(N_{H}\)): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The prior probability \( P(A) \) is the proportion of computer science professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{N_{CS}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A') \) is the proportion of humanities professors:
\[ P(A') = \frac{N_{H}}{N_{CS} + N_{H}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \). The description suggests characteristics more typical of someone in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

For simplicity, let's assume some estimations:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \): Low likelihood that a computer science professor fits this description.
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.9 \): High likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description.

The total probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A') \times P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036. Here's the answer in the required format:
