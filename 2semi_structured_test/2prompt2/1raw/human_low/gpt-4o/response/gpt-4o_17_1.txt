To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. This will allow us to update our initial belief (the prior probability) about the category Jason belongs to based on the description provided.

The relevant information is as follows:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- We are given Jason's description, which seemingly matches traits more common in humanities than in computer science.

Given the numbers:
- Prior probability (P(CS)) that Jason is a computer science professor = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- Prior probability (P(Hum)) that Jason is a humanities professor = 75 / 100 = 0.75

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given each category. Generally, creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and non-technical traits are more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- P(D | CS) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science. This is likely low; let's hypothetically set it at 0.2.
- P(D | Hum) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities. This is likely higher; let's hypothetically set it at 0.8.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(Hum | D) = \frac{P(D | Hum) * P(Hum)}{P(D)} \]

Where P(D) is the total probability of the description D, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | Hum) * P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 * 0.25) + (0.8 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Let's present the answer properly:

{\"probability\": \"0.0769\"}
