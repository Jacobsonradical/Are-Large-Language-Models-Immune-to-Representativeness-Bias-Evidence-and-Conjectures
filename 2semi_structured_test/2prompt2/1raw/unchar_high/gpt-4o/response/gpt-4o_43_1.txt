To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we start with the prior probabilities and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, note the sizes of the groups:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, we need to consider how likely such a description fits a professor in computer science compared to humanities. However, without specific likelihood information differentiating the two groups based on the given description, we typically start by assuming the description is equally likely in either group, i.e., 
\[ P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(H | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) remains the same for both,
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
