To determine the posterior probability, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Using the given numbers:

- The prior probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \), is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Hum}) \), is 25/100 = 0.25.

Given that the description doesn't provide specific data about traits distinctive to either group, we assume the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \), is the same. 

Therefore, we need to calculate:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be considered the sum of the probabilities of the description under both possible categories:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \times P(\text{Hum}) \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \), they cancel each other out, leading to:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Hum})} \]

\[ = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75 or 75%.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
