To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \( C \) be the event that the professor is in computer science, and \( H \) be the event that the professor is in the humanities.

First, we need to define the following probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that the professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the posterior probability that the professor is in computer science given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description and is given by:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that the sample sizes for computer science and humanities professors are 75 and 25, respectively:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description of Jason is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors (i.e., \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)), we have:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = K \cdot 0.75 + K \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = K (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = K \]

The constant \( K \) cancels out in Bayes' Theorem, so we get:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
