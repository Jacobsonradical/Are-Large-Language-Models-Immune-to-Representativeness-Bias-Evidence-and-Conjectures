To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event described in the profile of Jason.

First, we identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample.
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is the proportion of humanities professors in the total sample.
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we'd need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), but since the descriptions are uniformly chosen, we'll assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are roughly equal (assuming high ability, strong motivation, and good reputation are equally likely traits among both groups of academics).

Thus:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Therefore, the denominator \( P(B) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), we can simplify the equation to:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) can be approximated using the prior probabilities alone:

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Hence:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]

Note: This solution assumes equal likelihood of the described traits among both groups of professors. If further differentiation between \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) is available, more precise posterior probabilities can be calculated.
