To compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we assume that the probability of the description (\( P(B) \)) for both computer science professors and humanities professors is equal since we have no information otherwise.

Then, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given our assumption, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \) are both the same.

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

Because \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) = \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \), both sides of the equation that involve the description cancel out, just leaving the priors.

Therefore:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
