To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) based on new evidence (the given description).

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( H \) (prior probability that he is a computer science professor).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( E \).

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS Professors).
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total = 100 professors.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To proceed with Bayes' theorem, we need to make an assumption about the likelihoods \( P(E | \text{CS Professor}) \) and \( P(E | \text{Humanities Professor}) \). Since no specific information has been provided to differentiate the likelihoods given their disciplines, we will assume that the likelihood of meeting the description is reasonably similar for both groups.

If \( P(E | \text{CS Professor}) \) and \( P(E | \text{Humanities Professor}) \) are approximately equivalent, then:

\[ P(E | \text{CS Professor}) \approx P(E | \text{Humanities Professor}) \]

And thus, the posterior probability is driven mostly by the prior probabilities.

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor} | E) \approx P(\text{CS Professor}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
