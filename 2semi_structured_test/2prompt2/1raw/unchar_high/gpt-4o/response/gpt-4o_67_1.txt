To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the given description matches Jason.

We need to find the probability \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define the terms:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 in total, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor. But this likelihood is not explicitly provided, so we will have to assume it is equally likely within each group.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the likelihood of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a humanities professor. Similar to above, we assume it is equally likely within each group.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description \( B \). This can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ 
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) 
\]

Assuming that the description is equally likely \( B \) among both groups, we can treat \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = k \). Thus,

\[ 
P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) = k(0.75) + k(0.25) = k 
\]

This implies that the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) effectively cancel out in calculating the posterior probability.

So Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:

\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
