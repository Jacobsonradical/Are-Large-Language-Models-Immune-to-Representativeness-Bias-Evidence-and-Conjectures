To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

To compute the posterior probability, let's start by considering the prior probabilities:

1. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \):
    - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
    - So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \):
    - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
    - So, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. For \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), without specific data comparing personality traits of computer science to humanities professors, we have to assume that the description given for Jason is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal, they cancel each other out in Bayesâ€™ theorem, making the posterior probability dependent only on the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given that:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
