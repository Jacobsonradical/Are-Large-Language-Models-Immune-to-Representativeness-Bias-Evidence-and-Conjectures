To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's outline the basic components:

1. **Prior Probability of being a Computer Science Professor (\(P(CS)\))**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Prior Probability of being a Humanities Professor (\(P(H)\))**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

3. **Likelihood of Jason's Description given he is a Computer Science Professor (\(P(D|CS)\))**:
   - Assuming the description matches both fields equally well, we'd expect \(P(D|CS)\) to be similar. However, no specific distributions or significant indicators exclusively favor one field over the other.

4. **Likelihood of Jason's Description given he is a Humanities Professor (\(P(D|H)\))**:
   - As before, assuming a similar match, \(P(D|H)\) is similar to \(P(D|CS)\).

Since the description seems generic and does not favor either field distinctively upon the conditions provided, we assume \(P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H)\). This simplifies Bayes' Theorem as these likelihoods will cancel out in our ratio form.

Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given the likelihoods are roughly equal, they cancel out, simplifying to:
\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
