To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): Probability of the description, given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): Probability of the description, given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS \mid D) \): Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.

We can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where \( P(D) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Assume an equal likelihood for the description, meaning \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \).

So:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are equal (since we have no specific information about how likely the description fits either group):
\[ P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \]

Let's simplify:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
