To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. We start with the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes: there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving prior probabilities of 0.75 and 0.25, respectively.

Given that the description applies to Jason being part of either group, we assume the description provided is equally likely to describe a computer science or humanities professor if no other distinguishing information is provided.

Since there is no information in the description that strongly indicates Jason's field, we can use the prior probabilities directly as the posterior probabilities. Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Given that \(P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities})\), they cancel out, making our calculation rest on the priors:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75 or 75%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
