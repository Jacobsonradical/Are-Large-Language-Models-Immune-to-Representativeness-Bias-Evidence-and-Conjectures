To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

Let's define the terms:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring.

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need the following formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's calculate each term:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he's a computer science professor, is assumed to be uniform across the descriptions in both groups (since we don't have a reason to think otherwise based on the description provided).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of getting the description. Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the total probability can be broken down into the weighted average:
  \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
  Here, \( \neg A \) represents the event that Jason is a humanities professor, so:
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we assume uniform distribution of descriptions, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) would be the same for both groups. However, this often simplifies out with equal likelihoods:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.25 = P(B) \text{(assuming equal P(B|A) and P(B|\neg A))} \]

Since the number of descriptions is proportionally larger for computer scientists, the proportional term does make a difference. Thus:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.25 \]

Assuming equal descriptive probability:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Now we can finally plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B) \approx P(B|A) \), we retain \( P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75\).

Thus:

\[
\boxed{ 
    {"probability": "0.75"}
}
\]
