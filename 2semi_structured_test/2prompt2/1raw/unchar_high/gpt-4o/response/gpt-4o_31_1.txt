To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting this description for any professor.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is therefore \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Let's denote:
- \( A_{\text{CS}} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{\text{Hum}} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Jason has the given description.

Next, we assume that the description provided does not give any specific preference towards either group (as being highly able, motivated, and well-liked can be common in both fields). For simplicity, let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \approx P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \approx 1 \) since there's no detailed information suggesting otherwise.

Thus, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \approx 1 \) and \( P(B) \approx 1 \):

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
