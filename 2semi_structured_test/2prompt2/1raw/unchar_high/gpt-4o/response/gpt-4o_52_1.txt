To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We aim to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(D\)).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need the following components:
1. \(P(C)\): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \(P(H)\): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
3. \(P(D|C)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
4. \(P(D|H)\): The likelihood of the description given that the professor is in humanities.

First, we calculate the priors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description is equally likely for both groups (since the description does not strongly favor one group over the other and given no specific evidence to weigh otherwise), we have:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H)\]

Given this, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|C) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \]

So Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Substituting our values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{1.00} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\boxed{0.75}\).
