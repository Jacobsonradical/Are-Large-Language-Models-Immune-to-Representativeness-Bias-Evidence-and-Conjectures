To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is in computer science given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of receiving the description if Jason is in computer science.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is in computer science.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of receiving the description overall.

First, let's identify these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**: 
   The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science. 
   - Number of computer science professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 100
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \(P(\neg A)\)**: 
   The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
   - Number of humanities professors = 25
   - Total number of professors = 100
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)** and \(P(B|\neg A)\)**:
   The likelihood of the description given whether Jason is in computer science or humanities. Since we do not have specific information indicating that such descriptions are more likely in one group over another, we assume these are equally likely.
   - \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

4. **Overall Probability \(P(B)\)**: 
   The overall probability of receiving the description. By the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   
Since \( P(B|A) \) is equal to \( P(B|\neg A) \), the specific value is irrelevant because it will cancel out in the calculations.

So, we calculate the posterior as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \),
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
