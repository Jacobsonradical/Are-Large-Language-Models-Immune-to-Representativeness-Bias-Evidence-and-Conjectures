To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors and any other relevant information provided in the description, although in this case, the description does not provide information strongly favoring one discipline over another. 

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (H): P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - There's no strong evidence in Jason's description to suggest he is more likely to be a CS professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, we will assume equal likelihood given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Since P(description | CS) and P(description | H) are assumed equal for argument's sake and cancel each other out:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given this description is:
