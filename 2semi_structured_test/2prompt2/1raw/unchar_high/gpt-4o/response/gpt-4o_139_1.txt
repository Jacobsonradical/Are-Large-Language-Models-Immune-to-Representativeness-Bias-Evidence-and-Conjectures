To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

In this context:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that we receive Jason's description.

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(A') \)) would be:

\[ P(A') = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):

Assuming that the personality traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) are equally likely for professors in both fields (since no specific differentiating factor is provided based on the description alone), we have:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A') \approx 1 \]

Finally, the total probability \( P(B) \) is:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
