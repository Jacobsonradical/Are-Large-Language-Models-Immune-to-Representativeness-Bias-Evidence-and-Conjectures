To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{Hum} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): The description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(H_{CS} | E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly:
\[ P(H_{Hum} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum})}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{Hum}) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The denominator, \( P(E) \), can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]

We can make an assumption that the description \( E \) is equally likely to describe a computer science professor and a humanities professor given the high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation traits detailed in the description. Therefore:
\[ P(E | H_{CS}) \approx P(E | H_{Hum}) \]

Letâ€™s denote the equal likelihood of the description \( E \) for both groups as \( P(E | H_{CS}) = P(E | H_{Hum}) = k \).

Thus:
\[ P(E) = k \cdot P(H_{CS}) + k \cdot P(H_{Hum}) = k (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Now we can rewrite Bayes' Theorem for \( P(H_{CS} | E) \):
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
