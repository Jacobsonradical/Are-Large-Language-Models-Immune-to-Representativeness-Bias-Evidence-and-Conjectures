To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the description provided.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- We need to find \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \).

If we assume that the description of Jason being known for his high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors (i.e., no specific bias in the description towards either profession), then \( P(B | A) \approx P(B | \neg A) \).

However, under the assumption of equal likelihood:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

If \( P(B | A) \approx P(B | \neg A) \approx k \) (same for both):
\[ P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

Thus,
\[ P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \]

Finally, using Bayes' formula, if the description does not favor either group:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the given information and assumption of equal likelihood:
