To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine each component:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D|CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

First, let's compute the priors:

- \( P(CS) \): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(H) \): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods. In the absence of additional detailed information about how likely the description is for each group, we can assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields. Thus, we have \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Because \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are assumed equal, the prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) are sufficient to determine the posterior.

Finally, since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
