To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

Let's define the probabilities needed:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor:**

   We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.

   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   
2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:**

   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)** - the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|\neg A) \) - the probability of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a humanities professor:
   
   Given that the description does not give specific traits strongly associated with one field over the other, we'll assume it is equally likely for a computer science professor or a humanities professor to have such a description. Therefore:

   \[
   P(B|\text{CS}) = P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 1
   \]

4. **Marginal likelihood \( P(B) \)** - the probability of the description regardless of the field:

   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   
   Since both P(B|CS) and P(B|Humanities) are assumed to be 1, it simplifies to:

   \[
   P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1
   \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
