To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem provides a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The given description of Jason.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since 25 out of 100 professors are from humanities)

The probability of the description \( B \) is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the description given each type of professor:
 
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, without specific data about how likely each description is for each type of professor, we typically assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|H) \). This assumption is called the principle of insufficient reason or the principle of indifference.

With this assumption:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|H) \cdot 0.25 \]

If \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|H) \), the equation simplifies, and \( P(B) \approx P(B|A) \).

Now, substituting into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \times 0.75}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \times 0.75}{P(B|A)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
