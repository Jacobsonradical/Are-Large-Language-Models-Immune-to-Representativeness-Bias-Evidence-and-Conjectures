To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor from the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's establish the prior probabilities and the likelihood based on the given description.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Number of computer science professors: 75
   - Number of humanities professors: 25
   - Total number of professors: 100

   Therefore:
   - Prior probability (P(CS)): 75/100 = 0.75
   - Prior probability (P(Hum)): 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   Based on the description alone, there's no information suggesting a different likelihood of this description being more likely for computer science professors versus humanities professors. Hence, we assume the likelihood to be equal for both groups (i.e., P(Description | CS) = P(Description | Hum)).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   According to Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Given that the likelihoods are equal, the denominator P(Description) will cancel out:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
   \]
   Since P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | Hum):
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
