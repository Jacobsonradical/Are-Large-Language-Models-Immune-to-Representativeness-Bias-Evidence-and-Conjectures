To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that a professor is from computer science.
- \( H \) as the event that a professor is from the humanities.
- \( D \) as the description matching Jason.

We are interested in finding \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find each component:
1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability of the professor being from computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability of the professor being from the humanities.
3. \( P(D | C) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
4. \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we assume the description is equally likely to match any professor given similar traits were used in the personality tests and descriptions, if no prior knowledge biases against disciplines, we assume:
- \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \)

Thus, \( P(D) \) (the total probability of description) is expressed by the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D | C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Given \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), this means \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \) (let it be \( p \)):
\[ P(D) \approx p \cdot 0.75 + p \cdot 0.25 \] 
\[ P(D) \approx p (0.75 + 0.25) = p \]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(C | D) \):
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]
\[ = \frac{p \cdot 0.75}{p} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is given by:
{"probability": "0.75"}
