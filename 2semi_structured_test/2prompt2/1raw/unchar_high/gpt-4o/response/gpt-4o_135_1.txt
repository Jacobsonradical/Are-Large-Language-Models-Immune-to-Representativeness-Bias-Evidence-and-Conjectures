To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence provided by the description.

First, we need to determine the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We can start by setting up the prior probabilities based on the number of professors in each group:
- \( P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A_{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the description does not provide any specific information that strongly differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{Hum}) \) are approximately equal (i.e., the description is equally likely for both groups).

Therefore, Bayes' theorem simplifies to comparing the prior probabilities because \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{Hum}) \), making \( P(B) \) cancel out:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{Hum}) \cdot P(A_{Hum})} \]
\[ = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_{Hum})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
