To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given matches Jason.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Overall probability of the description given.

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( \neg A \)):

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We have no information suggesting if the description is more or less likely if Jason is a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor. Therefore, we can assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \).

Since we don't have specific values, we assume that the probability of getting Jason's description is equally likely whether he is from computer science or the humanities. Hence, any specific description is equally likely among the total sample of 100 professors.

Thus:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \) and since these probabilities would sum to 1:

\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Now compute the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 \cdot P(B|A) + 0.25 \cdot P(B|\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{P(B|A)} = 0.75 \]

However, since the description is equally likely among all professors:

\[ \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
