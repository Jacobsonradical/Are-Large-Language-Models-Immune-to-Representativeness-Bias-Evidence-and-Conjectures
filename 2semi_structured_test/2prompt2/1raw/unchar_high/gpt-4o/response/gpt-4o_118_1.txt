To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's outline the key elements:

- Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
  
- Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to consider the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D|\text{CS}) \), and the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D|\text{H}) \). However, since the description does not provide specific information that would clearly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors (such as field-specific activities or knowledge), we can assume \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{H}) \).

Bayes' theorem formula for posterior probability is as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|\text{CS}) \approx P(D|\text{H}) \approx P(D) \) (the description doesn't strongly favor one group over the other), we simplify this situation:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1.00} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
