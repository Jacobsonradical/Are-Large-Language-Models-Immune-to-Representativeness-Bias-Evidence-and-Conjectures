To determine the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, we need to consider the base rate of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)  (Probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)  (Probability of being a humanities professor)

Next, we must consider whether the description of Jason affects these probabilities. Since the description is quite general and does not contain specific traits that favor one group over another, we can assume it doesn't change the relative probabilities too much.

Thus, we use the prior probabilities as our posteriors because there's no strong reason to adjust them based on the description alone.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
