To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the problem, we don't have specific probabilities for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \) (where \( Hum \) stands for humanities). Therefore, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. 

First, letâ€™s calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we assume the description is equally likely for both groups:
- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \)

We can simplify the equation for Bayes' theorem as:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Given \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = 0.25 \), if the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
