To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

First, we start with the base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Therefore, before knowing anything about Jason, the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities (H) is:
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, we now need to update our beliefs using additional information. However, without specific details that distinguish CS professors from humanities professors based on the description provided (age, marital status, absence of children, ability, motivation, and professional reputation), we treat the description as having equal likelihood for both groups.

Therefore, the likelihood ratios for both groups given the description are considered equal, meaning they don't affect probabilities significantly. In this case, the posterior probabilities remain proportional to the base rates.

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science remains the same as the prior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Answer:
{"probability": "0.75"}
