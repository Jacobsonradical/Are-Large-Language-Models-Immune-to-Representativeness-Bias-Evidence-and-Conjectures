To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's the formula for Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting such a description from either group of professors.

First, let's define the terms more clearly:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors in the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (not a computer science professor).
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we don't have specific data differentiating personality traits between the two groups, we assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal. Thus:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \) as follows:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Given this, the formula simplifies:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the given information, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
