To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's define our events as follows:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(C|D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the probability of the description.

Given the problem, we are not provided with explicit likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Therefore, we need to rely on the base rates (priors).

The prior probabilities are based on the proportion of professors in each field:
\[P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

\[P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

Assuming that the description \(D\) is equally likely for both groups (i.e., \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\)) since no additional distinguishing information is provided:
\[P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]

Given that \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are unknown but equal:
\[P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k(0.75 + 0.25) = k\]

Where \(k\) is a constant representing the likelihood of the description.

Since \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), we can simplify:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
