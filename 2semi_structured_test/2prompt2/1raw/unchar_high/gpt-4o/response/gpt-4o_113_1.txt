To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we have to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

Given data:
- 75 successful computer science professors
- 25 successful humanities professors
- Total professors = 100

Assumption: 
- The description given does not imply a special likelihood for either computer science or humanities. Therefore, we will treat \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) as equal since there's no reason to believe that the descriptive qualities of Jason are biased towards either group.

Let's calculate each probability:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
  \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor (assumed equal).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description fitting a humanities professor (assumed equal).

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are assumed to be equal and do not influence our calculation, we only need to consider the priors \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \).

By using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
