Let's use Bayesian reasoning to determine the posterior probability. We need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of computer science (CS) and humanities professors in the sample:

- Number of CS professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) of a professor being from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) of a professor being from the humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the likelihood of observing the given description under each category. The description provided does not distinctly parse differences between computer science and humanities professors based on the traits listed. Therefore, for simplicity, we will assume the likelihoods are equal:

\[ P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid H) \]

Given equal likelihoods, the posterior probability essentially depends on the prior probabilities, as the description does not provide additional distinguishing information.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid H) \) and \( P(\text{Description}) \) normalizes the probabilities across both categories, we have:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \approx P(CS) \]

Thus,
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
