To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll consider the following:

1. \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(Hum)\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \(P(Desc|CS)\): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \(P(Desc|Hum)\): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given the problem details:

- \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Notice we lack specific data regarding the likelihoods \(P(Desc|CS)\) and \(P(Desc|Hum)\). However, considering there's no reason to believe that the description of high ability and strong motivation is significantly more probable in one group over the other, we'll assume for simplicity:

- \(P(Desc|CS)\) \(\approx\) \(P(Desc|Hum) \approx 1\)

Then:

\[ P(Desc) \approx P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Desc) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(Desc) \approx 1 \]

Thus applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

In conclusion:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
