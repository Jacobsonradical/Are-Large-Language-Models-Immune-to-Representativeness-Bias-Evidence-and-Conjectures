To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is represented as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason being a high-ability, highly motivated, and well-liked professor.

We need the following probabilities to calculate the posterior probability:
1. \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): the overall probability of getting the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( N_{CS} = 75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( N_{H} = 25 \)).
- A total of 100 professors (\( N = 100 \)).

Hence, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{N_{CS}}{N} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{N_{H}}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Under the assumption that the description of being high-ability, highly motivated, and well-liked is equally likely among both groups, the probability of the description \( B \) would be similar for both groups. Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \):

Let \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = p \), then:
\[ P(B) = p \cdot P(A) + p \cdot P(A^c) = p \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = p \cdot 1 = p \]

Thus, Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{p \cdot 0.75}{p} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
