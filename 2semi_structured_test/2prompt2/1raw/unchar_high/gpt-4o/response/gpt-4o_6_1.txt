To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem involves the prior probabilities, the likelihoods, and the evidence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**: This is the initial probability before considering the specific description of Jason.

    - The prior probability of a professor being in computer science (P(CS)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - The prior probability of a professor being in humanities (P(Hum)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of the description given the professor's field. For simplicity and because the description does not suggest any particular indicators unique to either field (computer science or humanities), we assume that the description is equally likely for both fields.

    - The likelihood of the description given the professor is in computer science (P(Description|CS)): This is assumed to be 1 (we have no additional information that makes it more likely to be in one field over the other).
    - The likelihood of the description given the professor is in humanities (P(Description|Hum)): This is also assumed to be 1.

3. **Posterior Probability**: This is the probability we are looking to find, updated based on the evidence provided (the description).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

Given our assumption that the description is equally likely in both fields, \( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|Hum) = 1 \), the evidence probability P(Description) can be calculated as:
\[ 
P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \times P(Hum) 
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 
P(Description) = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 1 
\]

Therefore:
\[ 
P(CS|Description) = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{1} = 0.75 
\]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75, or 75%.
