To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's a breakdown of the necessary components and computations:

- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)):
  Since the sample consists of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
  \[
  P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)):
  \[
  P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

- Likelihood of observing the description given someone is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)):
  Without further information differentiating the likelihood of such a description between computer science and humanities professors, we assume both groups are equally likely to be described in this way. Thus,
  \[
  P(\text{D|CS}) = P(\text{D|H})
  \]

Because the likelihoods are equal, they will cancel each other out in Bayes' formula. Thus, we only need to consider the priors:
  \[
  P(\text{CS|D}) = \frac{P(\text{D|CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{D})}
  \]
Since \( P(\text{D}) \) is constant for both groups and \( P(\text{D|CS}) = P(\text{D|H}) \), this reduces to:
  \[
  P(\text{CS|D}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
  \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
