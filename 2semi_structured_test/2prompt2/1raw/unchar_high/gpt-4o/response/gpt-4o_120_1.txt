To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Firstly, let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We are looking for \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We also have:

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To find \( P(D) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific personality traits, letâ€™s assume \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are uniform and equal, given that Jason's characteristics are not strongly indicative of either field.

So:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot P(CS) + 1 \cdot P(H) = P(CS) + P(H) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus, \( P(CS|D) \) becomes:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
