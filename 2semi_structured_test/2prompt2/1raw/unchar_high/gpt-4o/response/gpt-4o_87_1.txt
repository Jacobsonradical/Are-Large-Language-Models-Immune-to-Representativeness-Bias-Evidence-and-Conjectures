To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is mathematically formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, which is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(A_h) \)) is:

\[ P(A_h) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A_h) \), which represent the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a professor in computer science or humanities, respectively. However, we don't have direct information about these likelihoods without more subjective judgment. Since no distinguishing information between domains is provided in the description, we can assume that the likelihoods are approximately equal for both disciplines:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A_h) \approx 1 \]

Given \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring which is:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A_h) \cdot P(A_h) \]

\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{ 1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( 0.75 \) or 75%.

Thus, the answer is:
