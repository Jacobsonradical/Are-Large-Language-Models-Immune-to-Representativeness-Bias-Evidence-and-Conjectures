To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use Bayes' Theorem, which incorporates prior probability and the likelihood of the observed evidence given the respective groups.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The number of computer science professors is 75.
   - The number of humanities professors is 25.
   - The total number of professors is 100.
   - The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   
2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description does not provide specific evidence that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we do not have any direct likelihoods, and we might assume equal likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \).

Given the assumptions above, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be calculated using the following relationship from Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|Hum) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
  \[
  P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
  \]

Since we assume the description is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \)

Thus,
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
\]

Plugging in the prior probabilities:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
