To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem statement, we have:

- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(C) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we are not given any specific information about how personality traits are distributed between the two groups, we'll assume that the description provided is equally likely for a professor in either group:

- The likelihood of the observation given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{description} | C) \), is 1.
- The likelihood of the observation given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{description} | H) \), is 1.

Bayes' Theorem tells us that the posterior probability is given by:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

To find \( P(\text{description}) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
