To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( 75 \) be the number of computer science professors.
- \( 25 \) be the number of humanities professors.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
\( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, given that the information provided in the description (let's call this evidence \( E \)), does not strongly favor one group over the other, we can assume that the likelihoods \( P(E|C) \) and \( P(E|H) \) are similar. For simplicity, let's assume that \( P(E|C) = P(E|H) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Since we assume \( P(E|C) = P(E|H) \), we know:
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) = P(E|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(E|H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Given that \( P(E|C) = P(E|H) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(E|C) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability simplifies to:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(E|C)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.75" \]
