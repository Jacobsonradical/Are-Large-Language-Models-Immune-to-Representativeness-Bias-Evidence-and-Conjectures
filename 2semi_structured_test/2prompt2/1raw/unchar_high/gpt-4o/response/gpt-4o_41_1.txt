To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H), making a total of 100 professors.
- Prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We are asked to find \( P(CS|B) \), the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description.

Assuming the description does not provide specific information that distinctly differentiates between CS and humanities professors (i.e. Jason's description seems typical for professors in both fields), the probabilities \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \) are considered equal, making \( P(B) \) unnecessary for our calculation since it's the same in both numerator and denominator. Hence, we only need to compare the priors:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
