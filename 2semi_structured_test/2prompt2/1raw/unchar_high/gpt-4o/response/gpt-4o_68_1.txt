To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

In this scenario:

- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- P(CS) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.

Since the description of Jason does not provide any specific information that distinctly differentiates between computer science professors and humanities professors, we rely on the base rates.

Bayes' Theorem can be set up as follows for this question:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D) } \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science, which, without additional differentiating information, we assume is equal to \( P(D|H) \) for humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from computer science, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description, which can be split into:
  \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

If we assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), these terms cancel out in the Bayes' Theorem calculation. The normalized fraction simplifies to just the base rates:

Thus, \( P(CS|D) = P(CS) \).

Given the base rates:

- \( P(CS) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.25 \)

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply:
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

The answer can be given as:
{"probability": "0.75"}
