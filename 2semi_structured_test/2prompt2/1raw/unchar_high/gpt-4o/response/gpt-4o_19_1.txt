To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - The description matches Jason's personality traits.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) \), the prior probability of being a computer science professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

3. **Likelihood:**
   - Since we do not have specific evidence that distinguishes the likelihood of Jason's traits given he is in either field, we assume the likelihood of the description matching a professor in either field to be the same.
   - \( P(\text{Description} \,|\, C) = P(\text{Description} \,|\, H) \).

4. **Normalizing constant:**
   - The total probability of the description matching either type of professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \,|\, C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Description} \,|\, H) \cdot P(H) \).
   - Since \( P(\text{Description} \,|\, C) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \,|\, H) \) are the same and can be factored out, they cancel out in the formula:

5. **Posterior probability:**
   - We want \( P(C \,|\, \text{Description}) \):

   By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(C \,|\, \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \,|\, C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Given that \( P(\text{Description} \,|\, C) \) cancels out, this simplifies to:
   \[
   P(C \,|\, \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
