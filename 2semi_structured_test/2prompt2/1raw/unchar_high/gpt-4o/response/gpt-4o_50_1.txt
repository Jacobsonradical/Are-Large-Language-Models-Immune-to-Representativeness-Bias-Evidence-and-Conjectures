First, let's use Bayes' Theorem to update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given information.

Bayes' Theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: These probabilities represent the likelihood of seeing the given description based on being a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given only the description provided and without additional data to distinguish between how descriptions might differ between fields, it may be reasonable to assume that Jason's description is equally likely across both groups. Hence:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

In this case, we assume these are equal. For simplicity, let's say both probabilities are the same (this implies that Jason's description does not specifically favor either group).

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Given this setup:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Now, since we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let's call this common value \( P(B|A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 = P(B|A) \]

Therefore:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) \]

As a result, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability in this particular scenario:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
