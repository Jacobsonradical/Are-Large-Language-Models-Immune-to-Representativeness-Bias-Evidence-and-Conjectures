To solve this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update prior beliefs with new evidence. Here, we want to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description.

### Bayesian Update Steps

1. **Define the prior probabilities:**

   - \( P(\text{CS}) \) = Probability that a professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) = Probability that a professor is from the humanities.

   Given 75 CS professors and 25 Humanities professors:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Evaluate the likelihood term:**

   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

   Here, we need to estimate \( P(D| \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D| \text{Humanities}) \). Given no specific information differentiating between CS and Humanities based on the description alone, we might assume:
   \[
   P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{Humanities}) = \text{some constant}
   \]

   As these probabilities are equal, they will cancel each other out in Bayes' Theorem.

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

   Bayes' Theorem for our scenario:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   Since \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) are equal and will cancel out, the posterior probability simplifies to just the prior probability because the description \( D \) provides no additional distinguishing information.

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75
   \]

## Final Answer
\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}
\]
