To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description given each category (computer science or humanities).

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, consider the likelihoods. Since we don't have specific likelihood values from the description, and assuming the description doesn't provide additional information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume the likelihoods are similar or equal for both groups:
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \)
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \)

If we consider both likelihoods as roughly equal (as the description does not heavily favor one group over the other), this simplifies the calculations. Let's denote the likelihood equivalence as \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = x \).

Then by Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \), and our assumption on equal likelihoods (effectively canceling out \( x \)), we get:
\[
P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + x \cdot 0.25 = x
\]

Thus:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75
\]

Here, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{"probability": "0.75"}
