To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will employ Bayes' Theorem. In this context, Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting the description.

Initially, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of the 100 professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without any distinct information in the description that skews towards either computer science or humanities, we assume the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equal, meaning the description is equally probable for both computer science and humanities professors. Hence,

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

Since the likelihoods are equal and the priors differ, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is proportional to the prior probability alone. Therefore, the posterior probability is equal to the prior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
