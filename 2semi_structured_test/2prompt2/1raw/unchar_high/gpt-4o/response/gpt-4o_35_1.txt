To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to calculate the likelihoods:

- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of getting Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of getting Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have concrete data on how likely this description is for computer science professors versus humanities professors, we can make an assumption based on the context provided. Assuming the description is equally likely among computer science and humanities professors (i.e., non-discriminatory), then:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, the likelihood ratio \( \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B|\neg A)} \) equals 1.

Now, Bayes' theorem simplifies:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \):

\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k(0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Therefore:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
