To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here are the relevant numbers:

- The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:
  - There are 75 computer science professors.
  - There are 25 humanities professors.
  - The total number of professors is 100.

So the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Based on the description provided, there are no details that strongly favor either group (computer science or humanities), so the likelihoods \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | Hum) \) can be considered equal. 

When the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probabilities are the same as the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(CS | Desc) \) that Jason is a computer science professor remains:
\[ P(CS | Desc) \approx P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
