To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

Let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

In this problem, there isn't specific information to differentiate between computer science professors and humanities professors based on the description alone (other than their population sizes and the fact they're tenured professors):

1. Prior Probability:
   \( P(A_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   Given 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   Similarly, \( P(A_{H}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
   \[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Likelihood:
   Assuming the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor:
   \[ P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \]

3. Marginal Likelihood:
   The marginal likelihood \( P(B) \) can be thought of as the total probability of the description, combining both computer science and humanities:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]

Since we assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \), the marginal likelihood simplifies to \( P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \) because \( P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot 0.25 = P(B|A_{CS}) \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
Given \( P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \) and canceling out \( P(B) \) as they are the same, the formula reduces to the prior probability:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = P(A_{CS}) \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
