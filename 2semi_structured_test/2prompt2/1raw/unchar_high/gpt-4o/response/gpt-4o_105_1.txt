To update our prior beliefs based on the provided description, we'll employ Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly selected professor is from Computer Science: 
     \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly selected professor is from the Humanities:
     \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate how likely it is for a randomly selected professor from each group (CS or Humanities) to fit Jason's description:
     For simplicity, and without further specific data, we can initially assume that Jason's description is equally likely to appear in both groups since nothing in his description strongly suggests a preference for one field over the other. Hence, let:
     \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \).

     Given these equal likelihoods, \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - The probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description can be computed using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
     \]

   Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \):

     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
     = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
     \]

Hence,

{"probability": "0.75"}
