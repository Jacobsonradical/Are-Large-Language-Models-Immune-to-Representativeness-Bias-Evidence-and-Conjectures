To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across all professors.

First, let's calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

- There are 75 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we calculate the prior probability \( P(B) \):

Since we are given no specific information to distinguish between CS and humanities professors in personality, we'll assume that the described traits (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) are equally likely for both groups. So,

\[ P(B) = 1 \]

Assuming that \( P(B|A) \) is the same for both CS and humanities professors due to the lack of differentiating information in the description, the probability \( P(B|A) \)  for both sets of professors would be the same. In this case, Bayes' Theorem reduces to the prior probabilities because the description doesn't provide additional distinguishing information.

Since both groups share equal likelihood for the given traits and population,

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ 
\boxed{ {"probability": "0.75"} }
\]
