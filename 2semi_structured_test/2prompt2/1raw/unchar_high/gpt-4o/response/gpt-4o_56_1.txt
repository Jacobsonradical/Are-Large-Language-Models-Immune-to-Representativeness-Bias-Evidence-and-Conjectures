To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can start by applying Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we should consider the information we have:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason is one of the 100 professors from this sample.

We need to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(HU) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|HU) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the given data:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description does not contain any specific traits strongly associated with either computer science or humanities professors, we would assume that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|HU) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|HU) * P(HU) \]

Given our assumption \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|HU) \):

\[ P(D) \approx P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|CS) * P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|CS) * (P(CS) + P(HU)) \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|CS) * 1 \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|CS) \]

So, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx P(CS) \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
