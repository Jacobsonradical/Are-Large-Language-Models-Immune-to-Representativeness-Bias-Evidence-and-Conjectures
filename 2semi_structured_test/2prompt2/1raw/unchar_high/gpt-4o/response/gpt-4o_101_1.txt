To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

We define the events as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

From the problem, we have:
- The prior probability \( P(C) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we consider:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
where
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, the description given is rather general and doesn't strongly distinguish between computer science professors and humanities professors; thus, for this calculation, we can assume that the likelihood \( P(D|C) \) is approximately equal to the likelihood \( P(D|H) \). This simplification means:

\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

Given this simplification:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
