To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to calculating that probability:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
   - Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - To proceed, we need to consider the likelihood of observing the given description if the professor is from computer science versus humanities.
   - However, because the description does not provide specific indicators that would differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the probability of Jason fitting the description is roughly equal in both groups. 
   - Let's denote the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor as \(P(D|CS)\) and given that Jason is a humanities professor as \(P(D|H)\). Since we don't have any specific distinguishing information, we assume these are equal: \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\).

3. **Posterior probability:**
   - According to Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
     \]
     Given \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), this simplifies to:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
     \]

4. **Substitute the values:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
