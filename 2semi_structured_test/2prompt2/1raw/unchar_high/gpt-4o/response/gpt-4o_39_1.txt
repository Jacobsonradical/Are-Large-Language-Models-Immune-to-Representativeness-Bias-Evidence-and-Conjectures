To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's establish our prior probability:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's calculate the prior probability for a humanities professor:
- \( P(\text{not A}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given that we don't have specific information differentiating the descriptions for computer science professors and humanities professors, we'll assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\text{not A}) \).

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\text{not A}) \) are roughly equal, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) will primarily depend on the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately equal to the prior probability \( P(A) \), which is 0.75.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
