Before we proceed with the calculation, it's essential to apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   This step requires estimating the likelihood of the given description based on whether the professor is in CS or humanities. Since the description provided ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation yet married without children") does not show a clear distinction between computer scientists and humanities professors, we can assume the likelihoods are the same for simplicityâ€™s sake.

   - Probability of the description given the professor is from CS: \( P(D|CS) \)
   - Probability of the description given the professor is from humanities: \( P(D|H) \)

   Assuming no bias:
   \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Given that the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability.

Hence,
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\{
"probability": "0.75"
\}
