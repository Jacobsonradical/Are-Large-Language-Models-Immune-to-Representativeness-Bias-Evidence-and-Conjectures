To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) is the event of observing Jason's description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complementary Prior \( P(A') \)**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total.
   - Therefore, \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \)**:
   - This is the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. However, since the problem does not give us a reason to believe that the description provided is more likely to describe either group (based on the provided information), we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \).
   - Without additional information, let's assume the likelihood of the description occurring within either group is the same, hence \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \).

4. **Calculate \( P(B) \)**:
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \)
   - Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \), we can simplify it to using the priors:
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A') \cdot 0.25 \)

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are equal, their exact value cancels out in the computations.

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Simplifying the constant likelihood assumption, the posterior probability is proportional to the priors:
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.25} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \)

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
