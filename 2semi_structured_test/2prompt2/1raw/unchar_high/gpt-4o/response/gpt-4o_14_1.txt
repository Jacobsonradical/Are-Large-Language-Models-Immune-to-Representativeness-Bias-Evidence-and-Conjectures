To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given this description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the terms:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = prior probability that the chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) = prior probability that the chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) = probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \) = probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) = total probability of the description occurring. 

The prior probabilities can be determined based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description given doesn't strongly favor one group over the other, we might assume \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(\text{H} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \), we can simplify the equation to:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} \]

\[ = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]

\[ = \frac{0.75}{1} \]

\[ = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
