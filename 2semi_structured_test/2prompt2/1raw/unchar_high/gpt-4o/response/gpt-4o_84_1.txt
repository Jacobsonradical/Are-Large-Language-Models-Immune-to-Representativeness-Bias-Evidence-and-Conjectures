To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem for this problem can be formulated as:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason's Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's Description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of Jason's description being given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Jason's Description}) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

The prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The total probability \( P(\text{Jason's Description}) \) can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities of Jason's description being given he is a computer science or humanities professor, weighted by the prior probabilities of each discipline:
\[ P(\text{Jason's Description}) = P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Assuming that the description of Jason being a high-ability and motivated individual is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, we can simplify:
\[ P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \]

Thus, let's denote \( P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Jason's Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = K \):

\[ P(\text{Jason's Description}) = K \times 0.75 + K \times 0.25 = K \]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{K \times 0.75}{K} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
