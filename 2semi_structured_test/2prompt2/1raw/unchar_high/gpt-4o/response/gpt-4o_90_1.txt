Let's apply Bayesian reasoning to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

We need to compare the base rates and the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus fitting a humanities professor. 

1. **Base Rates (Prior Probabilities):**
   - Probability of being a Computer Science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability of being a Humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Since we don't have specific likelihoods provided for the description fitting one type of professor versus the other, we traditionally assume that the description could fit either type of professor equally well unless otherwise specified.

Assuming the likelihood of the given description (Jason's attributes) is equally likely for both groups:

\(\text{Likelihood (Description | CS)} = \text{Likelihood (Description | H)}\)

Therefore, the posterior probability relies completely on the base rates:

\[
\text{Posterior Probability (CS | Description)} = P(CS) = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
