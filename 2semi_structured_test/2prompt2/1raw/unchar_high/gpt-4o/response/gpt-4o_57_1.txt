To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, I will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting this description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting this description.

First, let's break down the information into the components needed:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
    - Number of computer science professors: 75
    - Total number of professors: 100
    \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability, \( P(\neg A) \)**:
    - Number of humanities professors: 25
    - Total number of professors: 100
    \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we don't have specific information indicating whether the traits described in Jason are more common in one field over the other, we will assume the probability of getting this description \((P(B|A) \text{ or } P(B|\neg A))\) is equal for both fields. Therefore:

3. **Proportional Likelihoods**:
    \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal, their values will cancel out in Bayes' formula, leaving us with just the priors.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.25 \]

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore, Bayes' formula simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
