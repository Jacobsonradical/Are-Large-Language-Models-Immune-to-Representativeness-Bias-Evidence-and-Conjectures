To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. Before doing so, let's define our events and their associated probabilities:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D | Hum) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

We start with the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

So:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The description given (D) is equally likely to apply to professors in both fields because it does not provide specific information that strongly discriminates between the disciplines. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of the description being given in each category is the same. This assumption simplifies our analysis and becomes a key factor in absence of further discriminating data.

Thus:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \]

Since these probabilities are equal, the posterior probability depends only on the prior probability. Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Since:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum)) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]

So:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot 1} = P(CS) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
