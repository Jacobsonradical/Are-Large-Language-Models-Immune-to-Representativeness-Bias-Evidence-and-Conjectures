To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an individual randomly chosen from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A' \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
- \( P(A') \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, let's consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \). Given no specific details that differentiate personality traits significantly between the disciplines based on the provided description:
- It is reasonable to assume that the description provided doesn't significantly favor one discipline over the other.

Therefore, assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \):
- The description matches a computer science professor with the same likelihood as it does a humanities professor.

Hence, \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \).

Now calculate \( P(B) \), which is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \):
Let \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') = k \).

So,
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

The k terms will cancel out. So:

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
