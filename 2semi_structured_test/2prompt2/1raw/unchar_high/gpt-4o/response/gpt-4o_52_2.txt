To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the given description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\(P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75\)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 25/100 = 0.25\)).

Since the description is chosen at random, we assume that the probability of the description matching a computer science professor or a humanities professor is equal. Thus, \(P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = 1\).

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description matching any professor:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (1 * 0.75) + (1 * 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

So, Bayesian update simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 * 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.75"}
