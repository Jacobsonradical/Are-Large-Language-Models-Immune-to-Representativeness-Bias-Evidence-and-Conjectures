To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, letâ€™s establish the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since the description (D) of Jason doesn't give us specific information that makes the likelihood more probable for either group (it states he is well-liked, highly capable, and motivated, which could apply equally to professors in both fields), we might initially consider a simplifying assumption where:
- P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1.

This simplifies the equation as follows:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the information given and the simplifying assumption that the description is equally likely for both fields:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
