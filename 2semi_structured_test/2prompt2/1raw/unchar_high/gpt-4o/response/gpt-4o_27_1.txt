To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided fits Jason.

We assume that the likelihood of the description \( P(B|A) = P(B|\text{CS Professor}) \) is the same for computer science professors and humanities professors, i.e., it doesn't favor one group over the other. Therefore, \( P(B|A) \) would cancel out. 

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of Non-CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
