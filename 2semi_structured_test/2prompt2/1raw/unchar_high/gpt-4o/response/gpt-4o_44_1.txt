To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that the professor is in Computer Science (P(CS)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that the professor is in Humanities (P(H)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Since we only have one description and no additional information specifically distinguishing between the Computer Science and Humanities professors, we'll assume the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either field. Therefore:
     - P(Jason's description | CS) ≈ 1
     - P(Jason's description | H) ≈ 1

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[
P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Jason's description})}
\]

\[
P(\text{Jason's description}) = P(\text{Jason's description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Jason's description} | H) \times P(H)
\]

Given that P(Jason's description | CS) ≈ P(Jason's description | H) ≈ 1,

\[
P(\text{Jason's description}) = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
\]

So the posterior probability is:

\[
P(CS | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
