To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event of observing Jason's description.

First, we need to identify the relevant probabilities:
1. \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(B|A)\): The likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(B)\): The total probability of observing Jason's description (regardless of his field).

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that Jason's description is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors (since we don't have specific details suggesting otherwise):
\[ P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \]

Let's denote this common probability as \(P(B|A_{\text{common}})\).

The total probability \(P(B)\) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]

Since \(P(B|A_{\text{CS}})\) and \(P(B|A_{\text{Hum}})\) are the same, we can factor them out:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{common}}) \cdot (P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(A_{\text{Hum}})) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{common}}) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{common}}) \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A_{\text{common}})} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
