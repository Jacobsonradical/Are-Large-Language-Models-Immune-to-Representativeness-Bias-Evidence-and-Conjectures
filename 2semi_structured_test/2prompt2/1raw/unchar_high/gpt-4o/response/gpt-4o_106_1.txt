To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should employ Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making the base rates:
  \[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are choosing a description at random from among all the descriptions, and assuming no additional information indicates that the description is more typical of one group over the other, we can initially assume that \( P(B|A) \) is roughly equal for both groups.

Thus, the calculation simplifies because \( P(B|A) \) cancels out when considering relative ratios of priors.

\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given the lack of additional detail favoring either group, 
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS professor}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities professor}) \]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS professor}|\text{Description}) \) depends largely on the base rates:

\[ P(\text{CS professor}|\text{Description}) \approx \frac{P(\text{CS professor})}{P(\text{CS professor}) + P(\text{Humanities professor})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
