To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Number of successful computer science professors (C): 75
- Number of successful humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

We need \(P(\text{C}|\text{Jason})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(\text{C}|\text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(\text{Jason})} \]

In this scenario:
- \(P(\text{Jason}|\text{C})\) is the probability of getting Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Jason}|\text{H})\) is the probability of getting Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(C) = 75/100 = 0.75\) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
- \(P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25\) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities)

Now, we assume that the personality description does not particularly favor one field over the other, meaning \(P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \approx P(\text{Jason}|\text{H})\).

Given that assumption,

\[ P(\text{Jason}) = P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Jason}|\text{H}) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \approx P(\text{Jason}|\text{H}) \):

\[ P(\text{Jason}) = P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \cdot 0.75 + P(\text{Jason}|\text{H}) \cdot 0.25 \approx P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \]

That leads to:

\[ P(\text{C}|\text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason}|\text{C}) \cdot 0.75}{P(\text{Jason}|\text{C})} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
