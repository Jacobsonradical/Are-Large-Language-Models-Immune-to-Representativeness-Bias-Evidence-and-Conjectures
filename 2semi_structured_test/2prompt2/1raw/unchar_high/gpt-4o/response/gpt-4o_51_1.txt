To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) as the event of observing Jason's description.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Since we are given no additional specific information that differentiates Jason's description between computer science and humanities professors, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \). This means Jason's description does not provide additional weight to one field over the other.

Under these circumstances:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, \( P(B) \), the total probability of Jason's description, can be considered using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(B|any) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|any) \cdot P(A) + P(B|any) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|any) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|any) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|any) \cdot 1 \]

Therefore, \( P(B|any) \) cancels out in Bayes' formula:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

In conclusion:
