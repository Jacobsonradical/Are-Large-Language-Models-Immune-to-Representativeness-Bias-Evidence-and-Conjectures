To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

- Total number of professors in the sample: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description under any circumstances.

First, we determine \( P(A) \) and \( P(A') \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, since we don't have any specific bias or details in the description that would differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) to be the same. This assumption means that the description Jason has an equal likelihood regardless of his academic field.

Thus, \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \), and due to this symmetry, the \( P(B) \) can be disregarded, leaving us with:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]

Given that \( P(A) \) = 0.75, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
