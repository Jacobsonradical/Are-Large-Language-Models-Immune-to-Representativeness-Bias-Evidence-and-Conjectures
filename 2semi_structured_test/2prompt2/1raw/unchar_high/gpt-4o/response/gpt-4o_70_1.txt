To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We have the following:
- Prior probability \( P(A) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability \( P(A^c) \), the probability Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

For simplicity, assuming descriptions do not significantly differ based on field:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given Jason is in computer science, is approximately 1 (or very high, but not exact).
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description given Jason is in humanities, is approximately 1 (or very high, but not exact).

The total probability of the description \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Given \( P(B|A) \approx 1 \) and \( P(B|A^c) \approx 1 \):

\[ P(B) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
