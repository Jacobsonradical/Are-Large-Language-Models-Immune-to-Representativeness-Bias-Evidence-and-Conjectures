To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason is one of the humanities professors.

We are given:
1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. The description of Jason, which we use as evidence \( E \).

From the problem, we have:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- And, \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need the posterior probability \( P(A|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( E \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

We already know \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \), but \( P(E|A) \) and \( P(E|B) \) (the probabilities of the description given Jason is in either group) are not explicitly stated in the problem, hence we must assume that the description "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation" is equally likely for both groups unless any specific information indicates otherwise.

Assuming \( P(E|A) \approx P(E|B) \), the combined probability \( P(E) \) can be written as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Since we are assuming \( P(E|A) \approx P(E|B) \):
\[ P(E|A) = P(E|B)  \]

Therefore, the formula simplifies to:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Finally, given the above assumptions leading to the simplifying assumption "probabilities of description are equal":
\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.75"}}}
\]

Given no additional specific information to discriminate between the two groups based solely on the description, our best estimate remains the prior probability.
