Let's break down the problem using Bayesian reasoning.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from computer science is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from humanities is \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description of Jason does not provide explicit information that can help in calculating the likelihood for either category. Descriptions are fairly general traits that could apply to both groups. Since no specific evidence tilts the likelihood in favor of either category strongly, we might treat the likelihoods as being approximately equal.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem, we update our belief based on the prior probability and the likelihood.

Since there's no strong evidence from the description to favor one discipline over the other, and we assume the likelihoods (P(description|CS) and P(description|H)) are equal or very close, the posterior probability will essentially be proportional to the prior probabilities.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately the same as the prior probability.

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is about 0.75.
