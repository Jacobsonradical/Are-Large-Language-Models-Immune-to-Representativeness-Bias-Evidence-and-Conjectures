To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We'll combine prior probabilities with the likelihood based on the description. Here are the key steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities**

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the study:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood**

We are given a description without specific traits known to differentiate computer science and humanities professors significantly. Thus, we assume the likelihood of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) \)) is equal to the likelihood given he is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities Professor}) \)). We denote both as \(L\).

3. **Normalization (total probability)**

The total probability of the description is the sum of the probabilities for both professions:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = L \cdot 0.75 + L \cdot 0.25 = L \]

4. **Posterior Probability**

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS Professor} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
Given \( P(\text{Description}) = L \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) = L \):
\[ P(\text{CS Professor} | \text{Description}) = \frac{L \cdot 0.75}{L} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
