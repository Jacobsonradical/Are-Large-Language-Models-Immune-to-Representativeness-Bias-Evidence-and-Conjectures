To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the following:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(HUM) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | HUM) \): The likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of observing Jason's description.

We start with the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HUM) \). Without specific details about how the likelihoods differ between computer science and humanities professors, we make a simplifying assumption that the description provided is equally likely (non-discriminatory) for both groups. This implies:
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | HUM) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(HUM | D) = \frac{P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM)}{P(D)} \]

Given that \( P(D | CS) = P(D | HUM) \), we have:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | HUM) \), we can represent this common likelihood as \( P(D | X) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | X) \cdot ( P(CS) + P(HUM) ) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | X) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D | X) \]

Simplifying Bayes' theorem for \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]
Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D) \), we have:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the described traits is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
