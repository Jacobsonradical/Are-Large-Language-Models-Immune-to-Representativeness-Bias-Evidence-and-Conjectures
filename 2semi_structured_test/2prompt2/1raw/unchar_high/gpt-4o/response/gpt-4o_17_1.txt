To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the Prior Probabilities:**

    The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

    \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

    \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Evaluate the Likelihood:**

    Since the description provided (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation) does not provide specific distinguishing information pertinent only to computer science or humanities professors, we will assume that the probability of receiving such a description is equally likely in both groups.

    \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 1 \)

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

    Bayes' theorem states that:

    \[
    P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
    \]

    Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be treated as a normalizing constant:

    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
    \]

    Given our likelihoods:

    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1
    \]

    Therefore, our posterior probability calculation simplifies to:

    \[
    P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
    \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{
   "probability": "0.75"
