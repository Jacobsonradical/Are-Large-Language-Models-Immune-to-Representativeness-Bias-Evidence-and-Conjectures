The prior probability of Jason being in either of the two groups depends on the proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors in the sample. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is from the computer science group:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) that Jason is from the humanities group:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not provide any specific characteristic that clearly differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume, based on the given information, that the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in either group is the same.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability because the description does not provide additional discriminative information. 

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
