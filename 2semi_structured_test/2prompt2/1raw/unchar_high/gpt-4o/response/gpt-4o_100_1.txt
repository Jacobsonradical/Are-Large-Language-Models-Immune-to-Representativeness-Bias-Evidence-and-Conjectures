To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CSP) rather than one of the humanities professors (HP), we'll apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CSP \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \cdot P(CSP)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given that it's a randomly chosen description, we're interested in the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CSP) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(HP) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the probability of the description fitting both CSP and HP to be equally likely (for simplicity, due to lack of specific distinguishing features given in the description), \( P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid HP) \) would be considered equal. Thus,

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \cdot P(CSP) + P(\text{Description} \mid HP) \cdot P(HP) \]

Given that the probabilities are equal, we can simplify:

\[ P(\text{Description}) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \cdot 0.75 + P(\text{Description} \mid HP) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid HP) \) are assumed equal and normalized, they cancel out when calculating the posterior probability:

\[ P(CSP \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \cdot 0.75}{P(\text{Description} \mid CSP) \cdot 0.75 + P(\text{Description} \mid HP) \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.75\).
