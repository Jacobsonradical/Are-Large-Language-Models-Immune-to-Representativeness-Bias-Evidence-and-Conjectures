To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

To simplify, let's denote:
- \( A_1 \) as the event that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( A_2 \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) as Jason's description.

Given the problem states:
- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors.
- These descriptions are chosen randomly from these groups.

Firstly, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_1) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now assume the likelihood of Jason's description being the same for both groups (both CS and humanities professors have an equally likely chance of having such a description). Since there's no specific information differentiating the probabilities given the description:

\[ P(B|A_1) \approx P(B|A_2) \]

Since we are given no specific evidence that this description differentiates between CS and humanities professors, it's reasonable to assume:
\[ P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) \]

Given these equal likelihoods, we now consider Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1)P(A_1)}{P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2)} \]

Since \( P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) \), they cancel out in the denominator and numerator:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(A_1)}{P(A_1) + P(A_2)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
