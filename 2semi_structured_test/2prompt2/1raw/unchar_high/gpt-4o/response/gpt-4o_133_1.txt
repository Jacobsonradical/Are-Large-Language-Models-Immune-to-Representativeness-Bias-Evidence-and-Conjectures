To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's attributes include high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked by colleagues.

We'll denote:
- \(P(CS)\) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(H)\) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\) as the probability of Jason's description given a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\) as the probability of Jason's description given a humanities professor.
- \(P(CS|D)\) as the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(D)\) as the probability of Jason's description.

The calculation follows Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

The priors are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we don't have specific likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we'll assume that Jason's description is equally probable among computer science and humanities professors for simplicity:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times 0.75 + P(D|CS) \times 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times 0.75}{P(D)} \]
Since \(P(D) = P(D|CS)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times 0.75}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
