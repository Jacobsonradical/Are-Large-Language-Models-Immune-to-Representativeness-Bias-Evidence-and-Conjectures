To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Probability of Description (P(B))**:
   - This is the total combined probability of the description being given for any professor (both computer science and humanities).
   - We do not have specific data indicating how likely this description is for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. In absence of differential likelihoods, one common approach is to assume equal likelihood for simplicity.

3. **No Information on Differential Likelihood (P(B|A) and P(B|¬A))**:
   - Given no specifics to indicate otherwise, we assume equal likelihood.
   - Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B|¬A).

Given this equal likelihood, the posterior probability Jason is a computer science professor is proportional solely to the priors:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(¬A)} \quad \text{(as } P(B|A) \approx P(B|¬A) \text{)}
\]
\[
P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
