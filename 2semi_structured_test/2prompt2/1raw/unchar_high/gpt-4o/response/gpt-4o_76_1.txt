To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. First, we need to establish our prior probabilities and then update these with the likelihood of observing the given description among computer science professors versus humanities professors.

Here are the essential steps:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates):**
   - Number of computer science professors (C): 75
   - Number of humanities professors (H): 25
   - P(C) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need the probabilities of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Since the description provided doesn't specify traits exclusive to either field, we'll assume these probabilities (likelihoods), let's denote them P(D|C) and P(D|H), are roughly equal. Let's assume P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1, for simplicity's sake (indicating neutral information).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Apply Bayes' Theorem: 

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Given P(D|C) and P(D|H) are equal:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\]

Substituting the prior probabilities:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
