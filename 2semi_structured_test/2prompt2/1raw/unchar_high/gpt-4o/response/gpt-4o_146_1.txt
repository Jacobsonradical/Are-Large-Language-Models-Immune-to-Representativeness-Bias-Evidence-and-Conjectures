To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis (in this case, that Jason is a computer science professor) given new evidence (the description of Jason).

First, letâ€™s define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is in humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given the sample, the base rates for the professors are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, we need the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Since we are not given specific details that differentiate the probabilities of this description occurring for professors in each field, we will assume they are equally likely. Thus:
- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \) and we assumed \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), we can cancel out \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Plugging in the probabilities:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
