Given that there are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities, we can calculate the prior probabilities:

- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H):
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we don't have any specific evidence that makes Jason more or less likely to be from either group based on his described traits (which are common traits and do not heavily favor either group), we use the prior probabilities as our posteriors.

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
