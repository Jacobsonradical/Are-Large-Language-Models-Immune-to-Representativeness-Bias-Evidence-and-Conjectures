First, let's consider the prior probabilities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability (before considering the description) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we evaluate whether the description contains any information that differentiates between computer science professors and humanities professors. The description states that Jason is a 30-year-old man, married without children, with high ability, strong motivation, and well-liked by colleagues. There is no specific evidence in the description suggesting any significant difference in likelihood between being a computer science professor or a humanities professor, based solely on this description. Thus, the description seems to be equally likely for both groups.

Therefore, the likelihood of the description being true for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor does not change our initial (prior) probabilities. In other words, the description does not provide enough evidence to change our belief about whether Jason belongs to the computer science or humanities group.

Thus, the posterior probability, which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, remains:

\[ P(\text{CS professor} \mid \text{description}) = P(\text{CS professor}) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
