To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{H}) \)):
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Since the problem does not state that having high ability, strong motivation, being well-liked, and having a positive reputation is more common in computer science than in the humanities, we assume these traits are equally likely in both groups.
   - Therefore, the likelihood ratio is 1, (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \)).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]

     Since \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \), we don't need to calculate the exact likelihoods because they are equivalent and thus will cancel out in the normalization. We only need the priors:

     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
     \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
