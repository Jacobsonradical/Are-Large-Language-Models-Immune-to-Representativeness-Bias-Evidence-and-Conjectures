To solve this problem, we use Bayesian reasoning. We are given the prior probabilities and the data to update our beliefs.

The prior probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the sample:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is the ratio of humanities professors to the total number of professors in the sample:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to compute the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since we are not given direct information about the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we assume that the description \( D \) applies equally well to both groups of professors due to lack of further details. Hence:
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

In this case,
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
But since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are equal, say \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = x \).

Then,
\[ P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + x \cdot 0.25 = x \]

Therefore,
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is simply the prior probability:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: \text{{0.75}} \]

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
