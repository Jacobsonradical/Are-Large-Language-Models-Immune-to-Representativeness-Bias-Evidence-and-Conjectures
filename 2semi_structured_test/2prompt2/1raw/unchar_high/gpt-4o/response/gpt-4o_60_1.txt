To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's define our events:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor,
- B: Jason's description.

First, we find \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total.
- So, \( P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Next, we find \( P(\neg A) \), where \(\neg A\) means Jason is a humanities professor:
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors total.
- So, \( P(\neg A) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).

Assuming the description `B` (Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children, high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) does not provide any significant additional information to distinguish between computer science and humanities professors, we consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are approximately equal.

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), their ratio is 1. So, we have:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), we simplify:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
