Let's begin by calculating the base rates from the given sample. There are 75 professors from computer science and 25 professors from the humanities.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can find the posterior probability. Bayes' Theorem can be formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we want to find (probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood (probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability (base rate probability of Jason being a CS professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood (overall probability of the description, considering both groups).

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   Since 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(A') \):**
   25 out of 100 professors are in humanities:
   \[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):**
   These represent the probabilities of the description fitting either a computer science or humanities professor. Without specific data favoring one field over the other in the given description, we'll assume equal likelihood (this assumption might change with detailed context). Thus:
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|A') \approx 1 \]

4. **Marginal Likelihood \( P(B) \):**
   Since \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description among all professors:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   Assuming the likelihoods are approximately equal and using the prior probabilities:
   \[ P(B) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
