To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to find the posterior probability:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let’s assume the likelihood of getting the description of Jason, given he is a computer science professor, and given he is a humanities professor, are equal. That is, \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are the same.
   
3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since we assumed \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\) and their individual likelihoods \(P(D)\) are both included, simplifying this does not change the probabilities because it will cancel out in the calculation:

So, 

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
