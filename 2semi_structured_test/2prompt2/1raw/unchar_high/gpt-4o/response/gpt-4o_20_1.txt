To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. We need to find:
\[ P(CS|D) \]
where \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( D \) is the description provided.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, we need to make some educated guesses to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Base Rate** (\( P(CS) \) and \( P(Humanities) \)):
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor:
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor:
     \[ P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood** (\( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Humanities) \)):
   We don't have specific information about Jason that strongly differentiates a computer science professor from a humanities professor beyond common academic success traits which are likely shared similarly among both groups. Therefore, we might assume:
   \[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Humanities) \]
   And since those are equal, their effect cancels out in Bayes' Theorem.

3. **Overall Probability** (\( P(D) \)):
   The description \( D \) is neutral and applies similarly to both groups based on the personalities of successful academics.

Given the above factors:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|CS) \times 0.75}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Humanities) \), they won't change the calculation, and we are left primarily with the base rates:
\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
