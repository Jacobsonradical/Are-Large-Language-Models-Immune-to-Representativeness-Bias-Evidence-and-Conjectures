To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the professor is a computer science professor as \( C \) and a humanities professor as \( H \). 

The prior probabilities, based on the sample sizes, are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We are given a description of Jason, but there is no specific information indicating whether he is more likely to be a computer science or humanities professor. Therefore, we will assume that the likelihood of this description is equally probable for both computer science and humanities professors, i.e., \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \approx P(\text{description} \mid H) \).

Since the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability. Hence, 

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given that \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \):

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
