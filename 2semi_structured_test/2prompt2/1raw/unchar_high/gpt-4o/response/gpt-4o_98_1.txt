Let's denote:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor

We are given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without additional information that specifically distinguishes between the two groups, we rely on the fact that this is a random draw from the overall sample. Since "high ability," "strong motivation," and being "well-liked by colleagues" are traits we would expect to see similarly in descriptions from both groups due to their success, we assume these characteristics don't provide significant distinguishing information.

Thus, the likelihoods of observing such a description given \(C\) or \(H\) are roughly equal. Under this assumption:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid C) \approx P(\text{Description} \mid H) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we get:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given the assumption that the description has equal likelihood under either group, we simplify:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = P(C) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.75" \]
