To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate each term:

### 1. Prior Probability \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \)
The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### 2. Likelihood \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \)
Given only the description provided, there's no specific information indicating a difference in the likelihood of this description between the two fields. Thus, we assume that:

\[ P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \]

### 3. Marginal Likelihood \( P(D) \)
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), let's denote this common value by \( P(D_k) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D_k) \cdot P(C) + P(D_k) \cdot P(H) \]

Factoring out \( P(D_k) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D_k) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]

Since \( P(C) + P(H) = 1 \):

\[ P(D) = P(D_k) \]

### Posterior Probability Calculation

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), and substituting \( P(D) \):

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D_k) \cdot P(C)}{P(D_k)} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = P(C) \]

Thus, the posterior probability is equal to the prior probability since there's no distinguishing information in \( D \):

\[ P(C \mid D) = P(C) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
