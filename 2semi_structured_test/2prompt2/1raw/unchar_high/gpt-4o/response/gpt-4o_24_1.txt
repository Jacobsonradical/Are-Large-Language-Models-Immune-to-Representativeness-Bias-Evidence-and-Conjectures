To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's designate:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(\neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( N_{CS} \)) is 75.
- The number of humanities professors (\( N_{H} \)) is 25.
- Total number of professors is \( N_{CS} + N_{H} = 100 \).

Our prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description being provided given he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, since the problem does not provide specific evidence that distinguishes between the two groups based on Jason's description, we have to assume the description given is equally likely for both groups (i.e., it does not significantly change our belief).

Therefore, in the absence of distinguishing characteristics and given equal likelihood, the posterior probability \( P(A \mid \text{description}) \) that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains proportional to the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A \mid \text{description}) \) is:

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = P(A) = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

```
{"probability": "0.75"}
