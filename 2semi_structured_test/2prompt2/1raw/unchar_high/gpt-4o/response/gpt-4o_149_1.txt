To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The prior probabilities and the given description will guide our calculation.

First, letâ€™s outline the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider how likely it is that Jason fits this description if he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Since we do not have explicit probabilities for how likely each group is to fit the description provided, we will assume that the likelihood of fitting the general description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) is equally probable for both groups. This gives us:

- \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | H) \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) will be the same whether considering \( CS \) or \( H \) and can be factored out, we focus on:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) \]
\[ P(H | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Because we assumed:
\[ P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | H) \]

The ratio \( \frac{P(CS | \text{Description})}{P(H | \text{Description})} \) will thus simplify to:
\[ \frac{P(CS)}{P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \]

This implies that it is three times more likely that Jason is from computer science compared to humanities based solely on the prior probabilities.

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{3+1} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
