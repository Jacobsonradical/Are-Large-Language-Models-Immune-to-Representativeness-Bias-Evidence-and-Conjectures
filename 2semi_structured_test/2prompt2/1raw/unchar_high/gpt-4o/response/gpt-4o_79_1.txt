To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Hereâ€™s the provided data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

We assume the description \( B \) is not biased toward either field, implying \( P(B|A) \) is approximately the same for both fields.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Let's assume the probability of receiving the description \( B \) given Jason's belonging to either field is the same:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), the likelihood ratio does not favor either field.

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is effectively the same as the prior probability, given our assumptions:
\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
