To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here's the given information:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- Jason's description: 30-year-old man, married, no children, high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need the priors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the description of Jason fits equally well with both computer science professors and humanities professors (since we have no reason to believe otherwise), we get:
- \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \approx 1 \)

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
