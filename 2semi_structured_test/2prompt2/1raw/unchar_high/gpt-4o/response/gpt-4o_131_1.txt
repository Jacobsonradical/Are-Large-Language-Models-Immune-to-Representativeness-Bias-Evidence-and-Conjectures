To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- Priors: 
  - The probability that a random description is from a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
  - The probability that a random description is from a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of observing the description given each category. Without specific data differentiating computer science and humanities professors based on the given description, we might assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

Thus:
- \( P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}. \]

Since \( P(description) \) can be broken down into \( P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \) and the likelihoods are equal, the probability simplifies to be proportional to the priors.

Therefore:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \cdot \frac{1}{1} \].

Given the priors:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75. \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:
