To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. In this context, Bayes' Theorem can be used to update the probability based on the given description and the initial proportions of computer science and humanities professors.

Here's a breakdown of how we can compute this:

1. **Initial Proportions:**
   - Number of computer science professors (\( CS \)): 75
   - Number of humanities professors (\( H \)): 25
   - Total number of professors (\( T \)): 100

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\( P(H) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   Since we lack specific diagnosticity from the description (i.e., how well being high-ability, strongly motivated, well-liked, and having a positive reputation discriminate between computer science and humanities professors), let's assume that the description is equally likely for professors from both fields. Thus:
   - Probability of the description given the professor is from computer science (\( P(D | CS) \)): 1
   - Probability of the description given the professor is from humanities (\( P(D | H) \)): 1

4. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**

   \(
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \)

   Since \( P(D) \) is the same regardless of whether the professor is in CS or humanities, it simplifies out when calculating the ratio. Thus:

   \(
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS) \cdot P(D | CS)}{P(CS) \cdot P(D | CS) + P(H) \cdot P(D | H)}
   \)

   Substituting in our values:

   \(
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75 \cdot 1}{0.75 \cdot 1 + 0.25 \cdot 1} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \)

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
