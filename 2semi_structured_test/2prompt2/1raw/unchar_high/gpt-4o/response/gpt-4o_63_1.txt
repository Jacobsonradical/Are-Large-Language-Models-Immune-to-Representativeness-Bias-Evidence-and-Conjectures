To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define our problem in terms of probability:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description doesn't specify characteristics or details that are unique to either computer science or humanities professors, we can assume that the likelihood of the description is somewhat uniform across both groups. Thus, \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

This assumption simplifies our final probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), we can cancel them out in the formula:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Now, substitute the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
