To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we will apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem is typically stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

In this context:
- A is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- B is the event of Jason's description.

### Step 1: Define Prior Probabilities
Jason could be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Define Likelihood
While we may not have specific likelihoods (\( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|Hum) \)), we assume Jason's description is equally likely among both groups because the description provided does not contain information that strongly indicates one group over the other. Thus:
\[ P(B|CS) \approx P(B|Hum) \]

### Step 3: Marginal Probability, \( P(B) \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given \( P(B|CS) \approx P(B|Hum) \), we can simplify the marginal \( P(B) \) assuming equal likelihood:
\[ P(B|CS) = P(B|Hum) = k \]
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

### Step 4: Calculate Posterior Probability
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
