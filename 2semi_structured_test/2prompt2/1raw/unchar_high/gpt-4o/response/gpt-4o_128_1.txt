To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   Assuming the description of Jason (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and a positive reputation) is somewhat equally likely to fit both computer science and humanities professors, we denote:
   - \(P(\text{Description} | CS)\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \(P(\text{Description} | H)\) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

   If we assume that these probabilities are roughly the same for both fields (since there's no specific information suggesting otherwise), then:
   - \(P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | H) \approx 1\).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since \(P(\text{Description})\) is the same for both fields and would cancel out in this proportional reasoning, we get:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)
   \]
   With our probabilities and assumptions:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
