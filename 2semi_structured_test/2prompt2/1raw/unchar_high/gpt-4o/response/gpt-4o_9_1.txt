To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we should apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the information we have:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
2. No specific personality trait information that discriminates between the fields is given in Jason's description.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description provided does not contain any specific indicators that distinguish between computer science and humanities professors—both groups can equally plausibly fit this description—we assume equal likelihood:

- Probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \)
- Probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \)

Without any additional differentiating information, it is reasonable to assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \) and both are equal to 1 since the description doesn't suggest anything specific to one field over the other.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \) and the total probability \( P(D) \) can be written as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \):

\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot P(CS) + 1 \cdot P(H) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
