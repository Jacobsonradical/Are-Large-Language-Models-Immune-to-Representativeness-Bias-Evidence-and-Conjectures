To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

1. **Prior Probability**: 
   - Probability that the description is of a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
     \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that the description is of a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
     \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - \( P(D | CS) \): The probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | Hum) \): The probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Since the specific likelihood values \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \) are not given, and there's no explicit information suggesting that this description is more likely for one group over the other, we'll assume these descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Therefore:

   \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \( P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)

Since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D) \) are not changing the ratio due to our assumption (they cancel each other out because they are equally likely), we can simplify this to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} \]

Given that prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = 0.25 \),

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
