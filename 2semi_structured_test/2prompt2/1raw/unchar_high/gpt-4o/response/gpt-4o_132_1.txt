To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Before considering the description, the prior probability (base rate) that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

and the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Here, the description mentions traits that are not necessarily specific to either group (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, good reputation). However, it does not provide specific evidence that distinctly favors one group over the other.

Therefore, in the absence of further distinguishing information, we can assume the likelihood of the description applying to a computer science professor is the same as that of it applying to a humanities professor.

Given that the description is equally likely for either group, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains proportional to the prior probabilities.

So, the posterior probability \( P(CS|Description) \) is:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
