To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

We assume the description provided doesn't change based on the field (as the information is generic and doesn't strongly favor one field over the other). This means \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal.

Let's calculate:

1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor.
There are 75 computer science professors and 100 professors in total, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor.
There are 25 humanities professors and 100 professors in total, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Because \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), simplifying Bayes' Theorem gives us:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
