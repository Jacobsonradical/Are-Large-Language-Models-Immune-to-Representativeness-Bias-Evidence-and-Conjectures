{"probability": "0.75"}

Explanation: Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, without any additional information (a priori probability), the base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75/100 = 0.75. The description provided does not contain specific characteristics that are strongly indicative of either field, so it doesn't change the base rate assumption. Therefore, the posterior probability remains 0.75.
