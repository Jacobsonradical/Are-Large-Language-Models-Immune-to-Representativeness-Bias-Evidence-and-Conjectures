To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the observed evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We'll use the following data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- The description provided is equally likely to describe a professor in either field of study.

Using Bayesian logic, we start with the prior probabilities, which are simply the proportions of each group in the sample:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Because there is no additional information in Jason's description that would make it more likely for him to be in one group over the other, the likelihood of the description given Jason's group (computer science or humanities) can be assumed to be equal:

\[ P(\text{description}|C) = P(\text{description}|H) \]

Since these likelihoods are equal, we don't need to adjust the priors based on the description. Hence, the posterior probability is the same as the prior probability for the computer science group.

So, the posterior probability \( P(C|\text{description}) \) is:

\[ P(C|\text{description}) = P(C) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
