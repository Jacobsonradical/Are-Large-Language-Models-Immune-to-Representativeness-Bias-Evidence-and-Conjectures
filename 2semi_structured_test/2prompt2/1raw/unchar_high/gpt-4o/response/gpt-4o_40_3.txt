To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, we need to define:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description for Jason being picked regardless of his field.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors in the sample (75/100).
- 25 humanities professors in the sample (25/100).

Thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are not given any specific information about how likely the description fits each group (i.e., \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)), we assume that the description is equally likely for either group. Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

This implies:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \mathbf{ {"probability": "0.75"} } \]
