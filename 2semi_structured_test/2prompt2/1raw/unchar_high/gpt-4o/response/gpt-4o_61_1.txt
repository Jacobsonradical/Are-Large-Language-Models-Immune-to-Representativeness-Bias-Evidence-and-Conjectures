To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our goal).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

First, let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Description matches Jason.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
- Prior probability \( P(A) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description "high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation" is equally probable for both professions, the conditional probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) can be considered equal.

Thus, \( P(B) \) is simply a weighted average of \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = c \) (a constant probability), and substituting the known priors:
\[ P(B) = c \cdot 0.75 + c \cdot 0.25 = c(0.75 + 0.25) = c \]

This essentially means that \( P(B) \) is simply \( c \), but we should realize that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{c \cdot 0.75}{c} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, since we assume the description fits both groups equally:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
