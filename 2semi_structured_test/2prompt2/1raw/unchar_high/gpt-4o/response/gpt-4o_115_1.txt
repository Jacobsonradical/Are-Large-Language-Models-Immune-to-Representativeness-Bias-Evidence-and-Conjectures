In order to estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem takes into account the prior probabilities as well as the likelihood of observing the given description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we assume that the likelihood of Jason having the described traits (such as being a high-ability, highly motivated, well-liked, married man without children) is similar for both groups, since no specific trait here is strongly indicative of belonging to one group over the other.

Given the absence of specific data to suggest a higher likelihood of this description fitting one group over the other, we assume:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \).

Since there is no information to alter these likelihoods, they essentially cancel out in Bayes' theorem.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}. \]

But since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups, we simplify to:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \propto P(\text{CS}) = 0.75. \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\{\text{"probability"}: \text{"0.75"}\}}. \] 

Therefore, the posterior probability is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
