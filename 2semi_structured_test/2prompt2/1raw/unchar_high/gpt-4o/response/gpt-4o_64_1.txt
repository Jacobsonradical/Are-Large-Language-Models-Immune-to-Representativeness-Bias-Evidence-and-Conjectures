To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypotheses are:

- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors in the sample (\( N_{CS} \)) = 75
- Number of humanities professors in the sample (\( N_{H} \)) = 25

We assume that Jason was chosen randomly out of the 100 professors, so each professor has an equal probability of being selected.

The prior probabilities for each hypothesis are:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description provided ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues") does not offer specific distinguishing characteristics that would significantly alter the likelihood of being a computer science versus a humanities professor, we can assume that the description applies equally to both groups.

Given that the description does not favor either group, the likelihoods \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{H}) \) are approximately equal. Therefore, the posterior probabilities remain proportional to the prior probabilities.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H})} \]

Since \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{H}) \) are the same, they cancel out, and we get:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(H_{CS})}{P(H_{CS}) + P(H_{H})} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
