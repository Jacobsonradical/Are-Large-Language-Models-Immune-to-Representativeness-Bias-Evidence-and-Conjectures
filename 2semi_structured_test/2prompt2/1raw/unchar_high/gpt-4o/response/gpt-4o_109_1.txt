To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. The theorem can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason provided.

First, we assign the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A') = P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \), which are the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. Assuming that the description is equally likely for professors of both fields (which is a simplifying assumption because the description does not give specific cues distinguishing the two fields), these probabilities can be considered equal.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \)

This leads us to consider the base rates predominantly, as the descriptive information \( B \) does not heavily favor one group over the other.

Lastly, calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \), the marginal likelihood \( P(B) \) simplifies primarily due to the base rates.

Let's assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') = x \) (where \( x \) is a constant probability of observing such a description for either group). This simplifies to:
\[ P(B) = x \cdot (P(A) + P(A')) = x \]

Now we find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

As \( P(B|A) = x \) and \( P(B) = x \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
