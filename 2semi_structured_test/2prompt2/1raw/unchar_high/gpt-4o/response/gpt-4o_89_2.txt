To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayesian reasoning. We start with prior probabilities and update them based on the information provided in the description.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that Jason is from the computer science (CS) group is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - The probability that Jason is from the humanities (H) group is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   The description provided for Jason doesn't include specific traits or behaviors that are obviously more likely for CS or humanities professors. Therefore, we will assume that the likelihoods are equal for both groups based on the given information.

3. **Applying Bayes' theorem**:

   The probability that Jason is a CS professor, given the description, is proportional to the prior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|D) \propto P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)
   \]
   Similarly, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, given the description, is:
   \[
   P(H|D) \propto P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Since we are assuming \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), which means the description is equally likely to come from either group, the posterior probabilities will be directly proportional to the prior probabilities.

4. **Normalization**:
   Since we have no additional specific information to change the balance, the posterior probability proportion should be normalized:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.25}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.25
   \]

Given this, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
