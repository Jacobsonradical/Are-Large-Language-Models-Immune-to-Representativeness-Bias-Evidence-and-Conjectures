To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, I'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability (P(A))**:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Prior Probability (P(~A))**:
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Therefore, \( P(~A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood (P(B|A)) and (P(B|~A))**:
   - The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. 

Since the description reflects traits that seem fairly general and do not provide clear distinctions between computer science and humanities professors, let's assume that the description has an equal probability for individuals in either group. This implies:
   - Therefore, \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|~A) \).

4. **Marginal Likelihood (P(B))**:
   - The overall probability of the description. This is given by:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|~A) \cdot P(~A) \]
Since we assumed the description has the same likelihood for both groups:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|~A) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = k \]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
