To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description \( D \).

First, letâ€™s establish the priors based on the proportion of professors in each group:

- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- And \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming that the description \( D \) of Jason being "a 30-year-old man, married and without children, known for his high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by his colleagues and enjoys a positive reputation" does not provide strong evidence to differentiate between CS professors and humanities professors, we can assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Since we are given no reason to believe one is more likely than the other, we consider them equally likely, so:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem for equally likely descriptions:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
