To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since we are given no specific differences in the descriptions, we assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). The prior probabilities are based on the sample sizes:

- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(C) = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

The overall probability \( P(D) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are assumed equal, we can simplify \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \]

Thus, we have \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is 0.75.
