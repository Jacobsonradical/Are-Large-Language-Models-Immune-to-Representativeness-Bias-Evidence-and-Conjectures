To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): the likelihood of the given description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): the marginal probability of the given description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 100 professors in total.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - There are 100 professors in total.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   We assume that the description "high ability and strong motivation" is equally likely among both computer science and humanities professors (since the description does not specify any discipline-specific traits).
   - So, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \).

4. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \) of the given description**:
   Since we assumed the likelihoods to be equal:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
