To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total of 100 professors

We are asked to calculate the probability given some characteristics, but since the description provided does not contain any specific information that would differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor (e.g., specific traits or habits characteristic of one field over the other), we need to rely on the prior probabilities.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that any random professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability \( P(B) \) that any random professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since no additional distinguishing information is provided in the description:
\[ P(\text{description} | A) = P(\text{description} | B) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given that the description does not differentiate between the two fields, we consider the descriptions equally likely for both fields:
\[ P(\text{description} | A) = P(\text{description} | B) \]

Then:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{description} | B) \cdot P(B) \]
Since \( P(\text{description} | A) = P(\text{description} | B) \), the calculation simplifies to:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | A) \cdot (P(A) + P(B)) \]
\[ P(\text{description} | A) = P(\text{description} | B) = k \]

So:
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Hence, the posterior probability:
\[ P(A | \text{description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
