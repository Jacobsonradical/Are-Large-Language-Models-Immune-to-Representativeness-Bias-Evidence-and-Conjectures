To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use Bayes' theorem.

First, we define our events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
  
Next, we identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we don't have specific information suggesting that the likelihood of the description provided is more probable under one group than the other, we will assume that the likelihood of the description is the same for both groups:
- \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), we can simplify:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
