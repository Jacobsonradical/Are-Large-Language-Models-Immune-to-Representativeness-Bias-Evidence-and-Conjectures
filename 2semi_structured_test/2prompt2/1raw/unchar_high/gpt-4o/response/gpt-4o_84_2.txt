To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \(A_{CS}\): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(A_{H}\): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(B\): The event of Jason's description.

Prior probabilities:
- \(P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Since the psychologists' descriptions do not provide any specific distinguishing features between computer science professors and humanities professors:

- \(P(B|A_{CS})\): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Suppose this is 1 because the description does not lean towards either category.
- \(P(B|A_{H})\): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor. Suppose this is also 1 for the same reason.

Then, the overall probability of the description \(B\):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
