Based on the information given, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let:
- \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We're looking to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

### Initial Probabilities (Prior)

From the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Description Likelihood

Without additional specific information distinguishing the description probability between computer science and humanities professors, we assume the descriptions are equally likely given the groups. Thus:
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

### Updating the Posterior Probability

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), the terms will cancel out:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \approx P(D|C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|C) \]

So:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
