To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The goal is to calculate \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

Given:
- Total number of professors = 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- Prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Given that the description does not provide explicit information that differentiates between CS and humanities professors, we might reasonably assume that Jason's description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \]

Letâ€™s assume \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) = k \) as they cancel each other out.

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = k \cdot P(\text{CS}) + k \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = k \cdot (P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
