To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. First, we need to define the relevant probabilities:

1. \(P(CS)\) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(H)\) = Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \(P(D|CS)\) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
4. \(P(D|H)\) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
5. \(P(D)\) = Overall probability of Jason's description.

The goal is to find \(P(CS|D)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]

Similarly,
\[P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}\]

Assume we have no specific bias towards the description fitting either group more likely than the other, meaning \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\).

Thus,
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}\]

Given there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]
\[P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

Therefore,
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75\]

Let's return the result in the requested format:
