To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the problem:
- The sample contains 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- This makes the prior probability \( P(A) \) of Jason being a computer science professor \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Similarly, the prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) of Jason being a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming the description is equally likely to describe both computer science and humanities professors, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal and thus cancel each other out in the equation. Therefore, the posterior probability depends only on the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75, or:

{"probability": "0.75"}
