To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, weâ€™ll need to apply Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the given description if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the given description if the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75 \)
- And \( P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25 \)

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

But we still need to break this down further:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Without specific probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) for the description, we'll assume the description is equally likely for both types of professors. This makes \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

If \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), it simplifies calculating \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 = P(D|CS) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|CS) \]

Thus, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | CS)} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
