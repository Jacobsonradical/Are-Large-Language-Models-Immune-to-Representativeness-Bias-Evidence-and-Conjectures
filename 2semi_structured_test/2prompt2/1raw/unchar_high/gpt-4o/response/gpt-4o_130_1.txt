To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that the description fits Jason.

To compute this, we need the following probabilities:
1. \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(B|A)\): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(B)\): The total probability of the description.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

First, let's find \(P(A)\):
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let's denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \(C\):
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we assume that the likelihood \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|C)\) are the same because no specific trait favors one group over the other in the provided description. Thus:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|C) \]

Since they are the same and will cancel out in the final computation, they do not impact the posterior probability calculation.

The total probability \(P(B)\) is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|C) \cdot P(C) \]

Given that:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|C) \]

\[ P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(C) \]
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = k \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.75\).
