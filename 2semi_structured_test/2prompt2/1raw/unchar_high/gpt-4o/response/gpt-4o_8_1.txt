To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be formulaically expressed as follows:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description occurring if he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

Given the problem, we have the following information:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\(N_{CS} = 75\)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\(N_{H} = 25\)).
- Therefore, the prior probability \(P(A)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- Similarly, the prior probability \(P(\neg A)\) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

However, we assume that the description provided is equally likely for both groups in the absence of additional specific information, meaning \(P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A)\). This simplifies Bayes' theorem because the likelihood term does not favor one group over another.

Thus:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75 \cdot P(B|A)}{0.75 \cdot P(B|A) + 0.25 \cdot P(B|\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Accordingly, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
