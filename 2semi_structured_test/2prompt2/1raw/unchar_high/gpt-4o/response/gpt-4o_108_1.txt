To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Similarly, the probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, without additional information about how likely this specific description (Jason being a 30-year-old man, married, and without children, with high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues) is to be among computer science professors versus humanities professors, we have to assume that the descriptions are equally likely across both groups. Thus, in this scenario, \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | H) \) are considered equal.

In this case, the posterior probability simplifies to the ratio of the priors:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
