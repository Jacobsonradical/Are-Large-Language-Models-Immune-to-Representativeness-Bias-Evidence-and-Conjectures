To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description matches the personality traits of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to calculate each component:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of being a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors and 100 total professors, so:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Since we are given no additional specific information distinguishing descriptions based on the field, we will assume no bias in the description provided, so:
   \[ P(B|A) = 1 \]

3. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor). Similarly, assuming no bias, this would also be:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

4. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability of being a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors and 100 total professors, so:
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are both assumed to be 1, \( P(B) \) simplifies to being the total probability of getting this description among all professors. Given this scenario and the uniformity assumption:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, we can plug everything back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
