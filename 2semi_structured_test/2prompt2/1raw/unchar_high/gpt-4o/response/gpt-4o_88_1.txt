To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the terms.
- Let \( CS \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) represent the descriptive information about Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break down the components:

1. \( P(CS) \):
There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(H) \):
There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
We need to assume that the description \( D \) is equally likely for both types of professors due to no specific distinguishing features between the disciplines being presented. So:
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

4. \( P(D) \):
Since \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description and given that we don't have any reason to believe the description disproportionately fits one group over the other, it can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), these would cancel out in the numerator and denominator.

By applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So the answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
