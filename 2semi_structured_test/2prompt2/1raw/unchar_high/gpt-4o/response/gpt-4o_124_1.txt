To answer the question of the posterior probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates both the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypotheses.

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): The evidence, which is the description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(A \mid E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \).

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
    - \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are \( 75 \) computer science professors.
- There are \( 25 \) humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  \[
  P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - \( P(E \mid A) \): Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
    - \( P(E \mid B) \): Probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the evidence does not strongly discriminate between being in computer science or humanities and we have no additional information to suggest that the likelihoods differ, we assume:
  \[
  P(E \mid A) = P(E \mid B)
  \]

Thus, we can conclude that the likelihoods are equal.

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem**:
  \[
  P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} 
  \]
Since \( P(E) \) is the same for both groups and they are equally likely given the observed evidence, it simplifies to:
  \[
  P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
  \]

Given that \( P(E \mid A) \) and \( P(E \mid B) \) are the same, they cancel out in the ratio:

Therefore:
  \[
  P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
  \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
