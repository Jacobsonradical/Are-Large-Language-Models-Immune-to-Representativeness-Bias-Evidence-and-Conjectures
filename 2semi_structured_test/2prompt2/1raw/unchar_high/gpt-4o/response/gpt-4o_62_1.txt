To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving Jason’s description.

Let's identify each component needed for Bayes' Theorem:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(A') \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(A') = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
\[ P(B|A) \text{ (not directly given, but we assume no bias in the description process, so let's assume it's equally likely for both disciplines)} = 1 \]

4. \( P(B|A') \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
\[ P(B|A') = 1 \]

5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason’s description. We can compute this using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
