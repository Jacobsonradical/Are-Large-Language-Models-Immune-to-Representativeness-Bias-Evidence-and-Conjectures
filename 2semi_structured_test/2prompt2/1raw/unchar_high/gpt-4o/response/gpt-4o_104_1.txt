To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of A given B,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of B given A,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A,
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of B.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given fits Jason.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we do not have specific details indicating whether the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) or \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher for computer science professors versus humanities professors, we can reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \). This, however, implies that without specific data favoring one over the other, the likelihoods do not impact the posterior probability and will be simplified in our computation.

Bayes' formula simplifies to just the ratio of the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \cdot (P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A)) \]

Since:
\[ \frac{(0.75 \cdot P(B|A))}{(0.75 \cdot P(B|A) + 0.25 \cdot P(B|\neg A))} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, assuming the description parameters do not particularly favor one discipline over another:
\[ P(\text{Jason is a computer science professor}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description given is:
