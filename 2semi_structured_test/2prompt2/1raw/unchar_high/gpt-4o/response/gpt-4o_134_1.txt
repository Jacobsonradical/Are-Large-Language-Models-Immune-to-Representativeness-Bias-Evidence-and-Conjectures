To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let:
\( A \) = Jason is one of the computer science professors.
\( B \) = The given description of Jason.

First, we need to determine the prior probability, \( P(A) \), that Jason is a computer science professor.

The total number of professors is 100:
- 75 are computer science professors.
- 25 are humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \), is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihood \( P(B|A) \). This is the probability of the description "high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation" given that Jason is a computer science professor.

In absence of specific data about how common the description is among each group of professors, we will make a simplifying assumption that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Since Jason's description does not appear to provide specific evidence favoring one group over the other, we can assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \]

The overall probability of the description \( P(B) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Given \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), we can simplify this to:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Since the description does not give us specific evidence distinguishing the groups, we can reasonably assume:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = k \]
For simplicity, we normalize this likelihood \( P(B) \) considering equal commonality and don't change the relative proportions.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, we get:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
