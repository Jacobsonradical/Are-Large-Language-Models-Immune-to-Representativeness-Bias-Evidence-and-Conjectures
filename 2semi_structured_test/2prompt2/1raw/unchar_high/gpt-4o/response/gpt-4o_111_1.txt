To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define these probabilities:

1. Prior Probability, \( P(\text{CS}) \):
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   
2. Complement Prior Probability, \( P(\text{Hum}) \) (Humanities professors):
   \[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. Probability of Description, \( P(D) \):
   \[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

Since we don't have specific probabilities for \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D | \text{Hum}) \), we'll assume that the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups (because nothing specifically favors one group over the other). Thus, these conditional probabilities can be considered equal:

\[ P(D | \text{CS}) = P(D | \text{Hum}) \]

So,

\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | \text{Hum}) \cdot 0.25 = P(D | \text{CS}) \]

Thus,

\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | \text{CS})} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
