To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (computer science professor),
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To apply Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{H}) = 0.25 \)

2. **Assume the description (evidence) "high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues" is roughly equally likely for both groups since no discriminatory information is given favoring one over the other.** Therefore, we can assume \( P(E | \text{CS}) = P(E | \text{H}) \).

3. Since \( P(E | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(E | \text{H}) \) are assumed to be equal, these probabilities will cancel each other out when applying Bayes' Theorem. Therefore, the posterior probability will reflect the prior distribution, meaning it will rely on the known proportion of computer science to humanities professors.

\[ \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{0.75 \cdot P(E | \text{CS})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.75 \cdot k}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
