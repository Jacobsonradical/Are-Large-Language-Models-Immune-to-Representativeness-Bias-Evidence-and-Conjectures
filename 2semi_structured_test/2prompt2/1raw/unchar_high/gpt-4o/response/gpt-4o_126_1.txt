To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \ ): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Given description of Jason.

From the problem statement, we know:

- There are 75 computer science professors (prior probability \( P(C) \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (prior probability \( P(H) \)).
- The total number of professors is 100.

Our prior probabilities are:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

For the description of Jason, we assume that it does not provide specific discriminative information about whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor (i.e., itâ€™s equally likely for both disciplines). Therefore, the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) are the same (though exact likelihoods are not needed due to them canceling out in this scenario).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(C | \text{Description}) \):

\[
P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given the likelihoods are equal, we can simplify it to:

\[
P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So the posterior probability is:
