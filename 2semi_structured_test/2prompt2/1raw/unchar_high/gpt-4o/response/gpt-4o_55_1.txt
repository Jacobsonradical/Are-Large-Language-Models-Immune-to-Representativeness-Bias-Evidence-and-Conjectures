To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The given description of Jason.

We want to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \(P(C|D)\) is the posterior probability we want to find.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, letâ€™s determine the prior probabilities:
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The total probability of the description \(P(D)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We assume that the description provided does not heavily favor either group based on the given information. So, for simplicity, let's assume \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are equally likely (or that the description gives us no strong reason to favor one over the other):
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

Given that the description is neutral:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Thus, the total probability becomes:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
Since \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), we can denote it as \(P(D|X)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|X) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|X) \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]
Since \(P(D) = P(D|C)\):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
