To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The probability can be calculated as follows:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Since the description given does not significantly distinguish between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we assume the likelihoods to be equal:
     - \(P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx P(\text{Description} | H)\)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]

   - Given that the likelihoods are equal and cancel out, the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) \propto P(CS)
     \]

   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = 0.75
     \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
