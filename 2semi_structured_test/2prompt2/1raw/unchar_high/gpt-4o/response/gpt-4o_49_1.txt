To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem requires the following steps:

1. **Prior Probability for Each Group**:
    - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) \)
    - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \( P(H) \)

Given the sample sizes:
    - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood of the Description Given Each Group** (assuming the description does not favor one group over the other):
    - Probability of Jason's traits given he is a computer science professor: \( P(D | CS) \)
    - Probability of Jason's traits given he is a humanities professor: \( P(D | H) \)

Given no additional information that suggests these traits are more or less likely in one group, we assume:
    - \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \)

Let's denote this common probability by \( P(D) \).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
    - Using Bayes' Theorem: 
    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \), \( P(D) \) cancels out in the ratio:

    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
    \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
