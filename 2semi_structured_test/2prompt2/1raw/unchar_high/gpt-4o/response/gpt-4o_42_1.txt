To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complement Prior Probability, \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A) \)** and **Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - Since we are not given specific information to differentiate based on the description alone, we assume the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either group. Thus, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \).

4. **Total Probability of the Description, \( P(B) \)**:
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   - Given the assumption that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \), the total probability \( P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
