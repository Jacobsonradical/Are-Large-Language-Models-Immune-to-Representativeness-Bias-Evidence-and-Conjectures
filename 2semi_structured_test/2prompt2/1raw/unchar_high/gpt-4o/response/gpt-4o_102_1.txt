To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the prior probabilities and use Bayes' theorem.

**Prior Probabilities:**

1. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)):
   There are 75 computer science professors and 100 total professors.
   P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)):
   There are 25 humanities professors and 100 total professors.
   P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

**Description Analysis:**

The description of Jason includes the following points:
- 30 years old
- Married, no children
- High ability
- Strong motivation
- Positive reputation among colleagues

Given no specific indication that these traits are more likely for one discipline over another, we assume these traits have equal likelihood across both disciplines. Therefore, the likelihood ratio (P(Description | CS) / P(Description | H)) is 1.

**Posterior Probability:**

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since P(Description) is the same for both CS and H, we can simplify:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Given P(Description | CS) â‰ˆ P(Description | H):

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
\]

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
