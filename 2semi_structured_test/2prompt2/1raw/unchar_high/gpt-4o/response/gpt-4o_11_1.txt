To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. The relevant information provided allows us to apply Bayes' theorem in a straightforward manner.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing Jason's description.

Given:
- We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Jason's description is chosen at random.

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that we do not have specific reasons (from the description) to believe it's more probable for computer science or humanities professors, we can treat \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|Humanities) \) as equal for simplicity.

Thus:
\[ P(B|CS) = P(B|Humanities) \]

So:

\[
P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{ P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{ P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot 0.75}{P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{ 0.75 \cdot P(B | \text{CS})}{ P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot 0.75 + P(B | \text{Humanities}) \cdot 0.25} 
\]

Since \( P(B | \text{CS}) = P(B | \text{Humanities}) \):

\[
P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
