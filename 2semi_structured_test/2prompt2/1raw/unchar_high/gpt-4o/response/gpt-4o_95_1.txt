To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the description given of Jason.

First, we need to consider the prior probability and the likelihoods:
1. Prior probability \( P(A) \):
   - The probability that the professor is from computer science initially is \( \frac{75}{100} \).
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - The probability that the professor is from the humanities initially is \( \frac{25}{100} \).
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A) \), and the likelihood of the description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(B|\neg A) \), are not directly provided and generally assumed equal because the description provided (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) does not strongly favor one group over the other.

Assuming equal likelihoods (implying the personality description does not differentiate the fields):
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Given the equal likelihood assumption, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is proportional to the prior probability, meaning:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75 \times P(B|A)}{0.75 \times P(B|A) + 0.25 \times P(B|\neg A)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, in Bayesian terms, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
