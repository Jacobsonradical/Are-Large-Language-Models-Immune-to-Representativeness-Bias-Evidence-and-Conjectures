Given the scenario where we want to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

Based on the given sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without any further distinguishing characteristics between the descriptions for computer science and humanities professors, we assume that \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) \) (they are equally likely to be described this way).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Because \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \) are assumed equal, they cancel out in the calculation. Therefore:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
