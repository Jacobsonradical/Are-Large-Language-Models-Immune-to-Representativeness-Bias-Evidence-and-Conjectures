To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We are given:

- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given the information provided, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is from computer science given his description, \( P(C \mid D) \).

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we need to calculate \( P(H \mid D) \):
\[ P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given that we have no specific information that makes the description particularly more likely for computer science than humanities, we can assume that \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \). Therefore, the posterior probability depends mainly on the prior probability:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), they cancel out, and we are left with:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
\]

Substituting the prior probabilities:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
