To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, letâ€™s define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), which is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

But before we can use Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Without specific data on \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \), we'll assume that the description is equally likely among both groups due to lack of distinctive information that differentiates the two groups based on the given attributes.

Thus, \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \), and we'll call this common probability \( P(D | *) \).

Following this assumption, \( P(D) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) = P(D | *) \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum)) = P(D | *) \cdot 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem with the equal likelihood assumption:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | *) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | *)} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75.

The answer in the specified format is:
