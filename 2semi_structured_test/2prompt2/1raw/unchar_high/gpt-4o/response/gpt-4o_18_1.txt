Given the problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of a hypothesis given observed evidence. It can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

### Definitions:
- \( H \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( E \): The description provided.

1. **Prior probability** (\( P(H) \)):
   The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary hypothesis** (\( H' \)):
   Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(H') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood** (\( P(E|H) \) and \( P(E|H') \)):
   Assuming that being well-liked, highly capable, and strongly motivated are traits that are equally likely regardless of being in computer science or humanities, we will consider them equally probable (this example simplifies the calculation to assume no bias in personal traits distribution):
   \[ P(E|H) = P(E|H') \]

4. **Total probability of evidence** (\( P(E) \)):
   Since traits are equally distributed:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H') \cdot P(H') \]

Given \( P(E|H) = P(E|H') \) and simplification, we observe:
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot 0.75 + P(E|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(E|H) \]

Thus, \( P(E) = P(E|H) \).

Therefore, by substitution in Bayes' theorem, the equation simplifies to:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot 0.75}{P(E|H)} \]
   \[ P(H|E) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description provided, remains:
\[ \mathbf{"probability": "0.75"} \]
