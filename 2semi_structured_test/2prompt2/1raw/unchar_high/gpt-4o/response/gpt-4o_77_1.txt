To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. We start with the given ratios in our sample and update our beliefs based on Jason's description.

First, let's outline our priors:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before any other information is given (P(CS)) is 75/100 or 0.75.
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor before any other information is given (P(H)) is 25/100 or 0.25.

We are given Jasonâ€™s description, which we will denote as P(Jason). We need to calculate:
- P(Jason | CS): Probability of Jason being described as such given he is a computer science professor.
- P(Jason | H): Probability of Jason being described as such given he is a humanities professor.

For simplicity and lack of specific information about how likely these descriptions are in practice, we'll assume that the description fits both groups equally. Hence, P(Jason | CS) = P(Jason | H).

Using Bayes' theorem, we need to compute the posterior probability P(CS | Jason):

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Jason | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Jason | H) \times P(H)} \]

Because P(Jason | CS) = P(Jason | H), these terms cancel out and we get:

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
