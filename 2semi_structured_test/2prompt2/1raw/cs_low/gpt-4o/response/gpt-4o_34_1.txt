To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability:**
    - The prior probability that a random professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
    - The prior probability that a random professor is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
    - We need the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \).
    - We also need the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \).

Since specific likelihood values ( \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) ) are not provided, we'll use our intuition based on the description. Because Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science, we can reasonably assume that \( P(D | CS) \) is higher than \( P(D | H) \).

Let's make reasonable assumptions based on the description:
   - Assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (since the description strongly aligns with computer science).
   - Assume \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (since the description weakly aligns with humanities).

3. **Calculate the Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{(0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
