Let's denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( C \) and the event that Jason is described as above as \( D \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \) is given by:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|C) \)**:
   - Jason's traits such as enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles seem to align well with characteristics likely found in computer science professors.
   - Let's assume \( P(D|C) \) is high, say approximately 0.9 (this is a subjective estimate based on the description).

3. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - The complementary event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Therefore, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(D|H) \)**:
   - Jason's traits are less typical of a humanities professor, so let's assume \( P(D|H) \) is lower, say approximately 0.1 (another subjective estimate based on the description).

5. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)** (using the Law of Total Probability):
   - \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \).

Now put it all together in Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
