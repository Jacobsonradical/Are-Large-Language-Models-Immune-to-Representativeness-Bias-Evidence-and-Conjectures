To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem can be written as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- So, the total number of professors is \( 25 + 75 = 100 \).

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's determine the likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)):
- The description fits characteristics more likely attributed to a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) than to a humanities professor. Thus, we can make an educated guess that \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high, let’s assume it to be 0.9 (90%).

Now, we need to consider the total probability of the description (\( P(B) \)):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Here, \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the probability of the described traits appearing in a humanities professor (\( P(B|\neg A) \)) is quite low given the distinctive activities linked to computer science, let’s estimate \( P(B|\neg A) \) to be around 0.1 (10%).

Now, let's compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
