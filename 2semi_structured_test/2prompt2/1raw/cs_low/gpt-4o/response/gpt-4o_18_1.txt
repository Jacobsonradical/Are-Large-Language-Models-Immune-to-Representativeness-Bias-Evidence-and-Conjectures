To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. It is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Based on Jason's description and the nature of the disciplines, we can make the following educated guesses:
- The probability of enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (which aligns more with computer science) given that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (assuming high likelihood).
- The probability of the same description given that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \) (assuming low likelihood).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

Calculating the numerator:
\[ 0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.225 \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, the final probability:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
