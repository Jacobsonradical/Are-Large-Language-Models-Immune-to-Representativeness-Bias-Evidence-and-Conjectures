Given the description of Jason and the fact that he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities strongly associated with computer science, along with his creativity, it seems more likely that he is a professor in computer science rather than in the humanities. 

To determine the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability of a professor being in computer science (CS) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of a professor being in humanities (H) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood that a professor with Jason's traits is in computer science (P(description | CS)) is presumably higher because of the activities he enjoys (coding and mathematical puzzles).
   - Let’s denote this likelihood by \( L_{CS} \) and assume that it is relatively high, say \( L_{CS} = 0.9 \).
   
   - The likelihood that a professor with Jason's traits is in humanities (P(description | H)) would be relatively lower since they are less associated with coding and mathematical puzzles.
   - Let’s denote this likelihood by \( L_H \) and assume that it is relatively low, say \( L_H = 0.1 \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   
   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, given by:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

   Now calculate the posterior probability:

   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
