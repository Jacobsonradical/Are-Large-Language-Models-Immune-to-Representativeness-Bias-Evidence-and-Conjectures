To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's establish the terms in the theorem:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of Jason being a humanities professor (P(H)):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability of the given description being observed if Jason is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)).
   - Probability of the given description being observed if Jason is a humanities professor (P(D|H)).

Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it's more likely that the description fits a computer science professor than a humanities professor. While we lack specific numbers for these likelihoods, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the typical interests of people in these fields:

- We assume:
  - \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \)

Then, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the assumed values:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) \approx 0.571
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.571"}}
\]
