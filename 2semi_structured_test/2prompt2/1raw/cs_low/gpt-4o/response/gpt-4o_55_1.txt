To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor as \( H_{CS} \) and the hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor as \( H_{Hum} \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[
P(H_{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H_{CS} \mid D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.
- \( P(D \mid H_{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need to find \( P(H_{CS}) \) and \( P(H_{Hum}) \), the prior probabilities. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the priors are:

\[
P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need \( P(D \mid H_{CS}) \) and \( P(D \mid H_{Hum}) \). Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor because several traits align well with typical traits of computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

We will make an educated guess (subjective probability) about these likelihoods. Let's assume:

\[
P(D \mid H_{CS}) = 0.8 \quad \text{(high probability because the description fits well)}
\]

\[
P(D \mid H_{Hum}) = 0.2 \quad \text{(lower probability because the description fits less well)}
\]

Using the law of total probability, \( P(D) \) is computed as:

\[
P(D) = P(D \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D \mid H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum})
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

Now, we can compute the posterior probability:

\[
P(H_{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

\[
P(H_{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(H_{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.5714"}
\]
