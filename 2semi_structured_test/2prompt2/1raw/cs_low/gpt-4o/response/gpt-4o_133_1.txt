To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which we can calculate as \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description occurring among all 100 professors.

Let’s assume that Jason’s enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more likely attributed to computer science professors than humanities professors. We'll assign probabilities to these descriptions based on assumed typical characteristics:

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not drawing or writing:

- Let \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (likely for computer science professors).
- Let \( P(B|¬A) \approx 0.2 \) (less likely for humanities professors).

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A)
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.25)}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Thus:
\[
{"probability": "0.571"}
\]
