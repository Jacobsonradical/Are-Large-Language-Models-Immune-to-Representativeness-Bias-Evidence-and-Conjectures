To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do it:

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's define the terms we need to calculate Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**: The probability that Jason is a humanities professor before considering the description.
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.

Letâ€™s assume that the traits mentioned in the description (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, but not drawing or writing) are more likely to be associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors. Without explicit values, we can estimate that \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (assuming a high likelihood given typical characteristics).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \)**: The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that humanities professors might be less likely to fit the mentioned description, we might estimate \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (assuming a lower likelihood given typical characteristics).

5. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \)**: The overall probability of the description.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.20 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.57.
