To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor, we utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we need the prior probability of Jason being a CS professor:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let’s estimate the likelihoods based on the description:

- It’s highly likely that a person who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles is a CS professor (high \( P(B|\text{CS}) \)).
- A person with these attributes (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys coding, etc.) is less likely but still possible in the humanities (lower \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \)).

Since precise numbers for \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \) are not given, we will assume typical values where \( P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \) and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \).

The overall probability \( P(B) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Plugging in the assumed values:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%.

Given this, the final output in the requested format is:
