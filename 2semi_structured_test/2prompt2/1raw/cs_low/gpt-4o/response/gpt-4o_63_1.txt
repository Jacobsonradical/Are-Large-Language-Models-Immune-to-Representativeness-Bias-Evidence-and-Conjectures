To solve this problem and determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability:**
    - The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
    - We need to estimate the likelihood of the provided description given the professor belongs to computer science (CS) and given the professor belongs to humanities (H).
    - Based on the description (interests in coding, mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying writing), it logically aligns more with typical traits expected of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

    Let:
    - \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
    - \( P(D | H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor

    Given his interests align more closely with computer science, we assume:
    - \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
    \]

    where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):

    \[
    P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) 
    \]
    \[
    P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)
    \]
    \[
    P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
    \]

    Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} 
    \]
    \[
    P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} 
    \]
    \[
    P(CS | D) \approx 0.5714
    \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714. 

So, the final answer would be:
```json
{"probability": "0.5714"}
