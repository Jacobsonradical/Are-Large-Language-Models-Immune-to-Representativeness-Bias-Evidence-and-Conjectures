Given the description, we can approach the problem using Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability in light of the new evidence provided by Jason's description.

To start, we have:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample:
\( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now we need to consider the likelihood of the given description \( D \) under each category:

- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of Jason’s description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) = Probability of Jason’s description if he is a humanities professor.

The Bayes' theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Given the description, it suggests traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (such as enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles) rather than the humanities. Thus, we can reasonably assume:

- \( P(D | CS) > P(D | Hum) \).

For a more quantitative approximation, we might estimate:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the alignment with computer science traits).
- \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given the mismatch with typical humanities traits).

Plugging these estimates back in:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

{"probability": "0.57"}
