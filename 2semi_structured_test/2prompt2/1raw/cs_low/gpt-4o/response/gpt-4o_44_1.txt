{"probability": "0.75"}

To determine this, I used Bayes’ Theorem, which helps update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's the process I followed using the given problem:

1. **Prior Probability:** 
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H): \( P(H) \)
   - Since we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood:** 
   - The likelihood that Jason's description matches a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \)
   - The likelihood that Jason's description matches a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \)
   - Due to the attributes related to coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. For the sake of a good estimate, assume:
     \[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
     \[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes’ Theorem:**
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   
    Substituting the values:
    \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]
    
    Now calculate the posterior probability:
    \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]
