To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on given evidence.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E|CS) \) be the probability of the evidence given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|H) \) be the probability of the evidence given that the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) be the total probability of the evidence.

First, let's set up the priors:
- The number of computer science professors = 25
- The number of humanities professors = 75
- Total number of professors = 100
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, let's make an educated guess about the likelihoods \( P(E|CS) \) and \( P(E|H) \) given the description of Jason. Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, these activities are more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

- Assume \( P(E|CS) = 0.9 \) (since the activities and interests fit well with a computer science professor)
- Assume \( P(E|H) = 0.1 \) (since it's less likely that a humanities professor would have these particular interests)

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability \( P(CS|E) \):
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

So,
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
