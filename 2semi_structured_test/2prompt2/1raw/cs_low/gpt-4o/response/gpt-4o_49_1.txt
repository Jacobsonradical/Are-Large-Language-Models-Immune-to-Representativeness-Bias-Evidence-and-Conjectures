To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 100.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving Jason's description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):

Jason's description suggests characteristics that align more closely with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Let's make educated guesses:
- \( P(B|A) \) might be high, say \( 0.9 \).
- \( P(B|A') \) might be lower, say \( 0.2 \).

Now calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
