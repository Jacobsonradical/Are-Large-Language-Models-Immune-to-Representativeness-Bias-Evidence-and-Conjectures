Given the description of Jason and the details of the study, we will use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability. 

### Bayes' Theorem
The theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) since 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) since 75 out of 100 professors are in humanities.

#### Estimating \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):
To accurately do this, we need explicit information about how typical the described traits (such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are in both groups. Generally:

- The description of enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles aligns well with a computer science professor, suggesting \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high.
- These traits are less common in humanities professors, suggesting \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low.

For the sake of estimating, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

#### Calculating \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.7 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.175 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

#### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.7 * 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.175}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.7 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.7"}
