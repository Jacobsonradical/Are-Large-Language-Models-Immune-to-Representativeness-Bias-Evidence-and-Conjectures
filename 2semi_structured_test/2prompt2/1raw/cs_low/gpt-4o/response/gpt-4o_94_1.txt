To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor, P(CS), is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor, P(H), is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

We also take into account the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Intuitively, Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles suggest a higher likelihood of fitting a computer science professor.

Let's denote:
- The evidence (description) as E.
- The probability of observing E given Jason is a computer science professor as P(E|CS).
- The probability of observing E given Jason is a humanities professor as P(E|H).

While exact values for P(E|CS) and P(E|H) are not given, we can reason that P(E|CS) is likely higher than P(E|H). Let's make an educated guess:
- Suppose P(E|CS) is 0.8 (high compatibility with a CS professor).
- Suppose P(E|H) is 0.2 (low compatibility with a humanities professor).

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|E) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
