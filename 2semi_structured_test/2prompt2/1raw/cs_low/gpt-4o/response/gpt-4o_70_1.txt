To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason's description fits.

Firstly, we need to define these probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- A total of 100 professors.

So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(A_c) = 0.75 \).

Now, let's estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A_c) \), although exact values can't be determined without additional information, we can use context clues in the description.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which typically are more associated with computer science professors. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A_c) \).

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (high, given his interests align well with CS)
- \( P(B|A_c) \approx 0.2 \) (low, given his interests are less common in humanities)

Given \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c) \):
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
