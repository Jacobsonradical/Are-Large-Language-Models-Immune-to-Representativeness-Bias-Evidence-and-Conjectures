To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. In this context, Bayes' theorem can help us update our prior belief about whether Jason is a computer science professor based on the description provided.

We start with the following prior probabilities:

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: P(Hum) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need the likelihoods:

- The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor: P(D|CS)
- The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor: P(D|Hum)

Without detailed statistical data on personality traits from both groups, we must resort to a qualitative assessment. The description mentions characteristics and hobbies that seem to align more closely with someone in computer science (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles).

For the sake of calculation, let's assume:

- P(D|CS) is high, say 0.9 (since Jason's description fits well with a computer science professor)
- P(D|Hum) is lower, say 0.1 (since Jason's description does not fit as well with a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our belief as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{(0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
