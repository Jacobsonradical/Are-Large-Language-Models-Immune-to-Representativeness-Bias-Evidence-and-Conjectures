To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The following steps outline the calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We need to estimate the likelihoods based on Jason's description. Considering Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. Letâ€™s assume these probabilities.
   - Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) = let's assume 0.9
   - Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|Hum) \)) = let's assume 0.2

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
            = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15}
            = \frac{0.225}{0.375}
            = 0.6
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.6"}
