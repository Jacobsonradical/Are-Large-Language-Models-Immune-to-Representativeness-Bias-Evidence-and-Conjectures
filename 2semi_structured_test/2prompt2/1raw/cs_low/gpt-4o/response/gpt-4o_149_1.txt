To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is generally expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence described about Jason.

First, we define our probabilities:
1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \) - The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability** \( P(A^c) \) - The prior probability of Jason not being a computer science professor (i.e., being a humanities professor):
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \) - The probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor. Letâ€™s assume this probability is relatively high, say 0.8.

4. **Complement Likelihood** \( P(B|A^c) \) - The probability of the evidence given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given Jason doesn't enjoy drawing or writing and enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles, it seems less likely, but still possible. Let's assume this probability is relatively low, say 0.2.

5. **Total Probability** \( P(B) \) - The probability of the evidence:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = (0.2) + (0.15) = 0.35
   \]

Putting it all into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
