{"probability": "0.75"}

The reasoning behind this result is based on both the base rates and the description provided. Initially, we know the base rates: there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, giving us a prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

The description of Jason includes elements that are stereotypically associated with a computer science professor, such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (which could indicate precision and a methodical nature). He also doesn't enjoy drawing or writing, which are activities more commonly associated with humanities professors.

Given these indicators:
1. The prior probability of Jason being from computer science is 0.25.
2. The likelihood of Jasonâ€™s descriptive traits appearing in a computer science professor is higher than in a humanities professor.

By Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability with the likelihood of the evidence, we adjust our prior belief in the direction suggested by the new evidence (traits matching more closely to computer science).

Thus, the updated (posterior) probability leans significantly towards Jason being a computer science professor rather than from the humanities. This updated estimate is approximately 0.75.
