To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Number of computer science professors (\(C\)) = 25
   - Number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 75
   - Total number of professors = 100
   - Prior probability \( P(C) \) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Prior probability \( P(H) \) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**: We need to consider how likely it is that someone with Jason's description is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given the elements in Jason's description (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, does not enjoy drawing or writing), these traits seem more aligned with characteristics associated with computer science. 

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]

   - Let \( D \) represent Jason's description.
   - \( P(D|C) \) is the probability that someone in computer science has Jason's description. Given that this description strongly aligns with typical traits of a computer scientist, we can estimate this to be relatively high, say around 0.9.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is the probability that someone in the humanities has Jason's description. This is likely much lower since the description focuses on activities and traits more typical of computer science. Letâ€™s estimate this to be around 0.2.

Thus:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} 
       = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15}
       = \frac{0.225}{0.375}
       = 0.6
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.6.
