To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

Firstly, let's recall the necessary probabilities:
1. The prior probability \( P(C) \) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
2. The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To find the posterior probability \( P(C|D) \), we need to consider:
- The likelihood \( P(D|C) \) of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- The likelihood \( P(D|H) \) of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his other traits such as being conservative and careful, it's more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. However, to make a Bayesian inference, let's assume the following likelihoods in the absence of precise measurements:
- Assume \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the specific interests and traits matching a computer science professor).
- Assume \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood as the interests are less common among humanities professors).

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
