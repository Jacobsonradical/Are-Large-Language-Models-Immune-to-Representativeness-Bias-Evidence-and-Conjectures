To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's establish the priors:
- Out of 100 professors, 25 are computer science professors, and 75 are humanities professors.
- So, \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

Given the description, Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing) align more closely with typical computer science professors than with humanities professors. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor) is relatively high. Suppose this is \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) is much lower. Suppose this is \( 0.2 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{0.5714} \]

Thus, the format:
