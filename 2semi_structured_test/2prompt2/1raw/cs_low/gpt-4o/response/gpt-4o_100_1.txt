To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The relevant equation according to Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break down the components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description.
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(B|A) \):**
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. This depends on the specifics of the description and its alignment with typical traits of computer science professors. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical for computer science professors, we might estimate a high probability, say \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \).

3. **Prior Probability \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. The description fits less well for humanities professors, so we might estimate a lower probability, say \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \).

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   The total probability of the description. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9) \cdot (0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
