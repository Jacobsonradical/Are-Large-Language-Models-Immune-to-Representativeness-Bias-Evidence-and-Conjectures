To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which in this context helps us update our probability estimate for Jason being a computer science professor based on the given description.

First, let’s outline our known quantities:

1. The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \), is the proportion of computer science professors in the overall sample.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. The prior probability of any randomly selected professor being from the humanities group, \( P(H) \), is the proportion of humanities professors in the overall sample.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. We need to estimate the likelihood of observing the description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \), and the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \).

Given Jason’s interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—activities and skills that are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors—this can help estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):

- \( P(D | CS) \): High. Let's assume this to be 0.9.
- \( P(D | H) \): Lower. Let's assume this to be 0.1.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

To find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Therefore,
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description is:
\[
\{\text{"probability": "0.75"}\}
\]
