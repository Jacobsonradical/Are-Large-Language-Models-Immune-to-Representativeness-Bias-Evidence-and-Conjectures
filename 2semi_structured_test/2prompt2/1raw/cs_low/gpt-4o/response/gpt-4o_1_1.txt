To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The prior probabilities and likelihoods need to be considered.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\(P(Hum)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Given Jason's description, we assess how likely it is that this description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

The likelihoods, \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | Hum)\), although subjective, can be inferred from the given description:

- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles and disinterest in writing fits the stereotype of a computer science professor.
- Humanities professors typically engage more with drawing or writing.

We will assign these likelihoods as:
- \( P(D | CS) \): High, say 0.9
- \( P(D | Hum) \): Low, say 0.2

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.6.
