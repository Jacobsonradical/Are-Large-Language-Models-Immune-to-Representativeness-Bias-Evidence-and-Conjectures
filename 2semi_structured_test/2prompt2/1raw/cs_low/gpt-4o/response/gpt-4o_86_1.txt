To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being associated with a computer science professor (likelihood).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the description being associated with a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (P(A)).
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Assuming the description fits computer science professors better due to the mention of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (common traits among computer science professors), we'd assign a higher likelihood to computer science professors.
- Let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) given the description closely fits a computer science professor.
- Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.2 \) as the description is less likely to fit a humanities professor.

Calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.571"}
