To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Let's define the following:

- \( C_{\text{CS}} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( C_{\text{Hu}} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C_{\text{CS}}|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:
\[ P(C_{\text{CS}}|D) = \frac{P(D|C_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(C_{\text{CS}})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, can be broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(C_{\text{CS}}) + P(D|C_{\text{Hu}}) \cdot P(C_{\text{Hu}}) \]

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(C_{\text{Hu}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To proceed, we need to make an assumption about the likelihoods \( P(D|C_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(D|C_{\text{Hu}}) \). Based on Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles: Higher likelihood he is in computer science.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing: Lower likelihood for humanities.

Thus, we might reasonably assume:
\[ P(D|C_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|C_{\text{Hu}}) \approx 0.1 \]

Using these likelihoods and prior probabilities, we calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(C_{\text{CS}}|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{ (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) } \]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[ 0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.225 \]

Then the denominator:
\[ 0.225 + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally:
\[ P(C_{\text{CS}}|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
