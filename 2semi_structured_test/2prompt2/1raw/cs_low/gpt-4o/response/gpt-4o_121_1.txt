Given the description of Jason and the prior information about the sample, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let’s summarize the provided information:
- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities for selecting a professor from each discipline are:
  - \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) (computer science)
  - \( P(H) = 0.75 \) (humanities)

Considering Jason’s description, we can think about how likely it is for Jason to be a professor of computer science or humanities given his traits and interests.

Jason's traits and interests:
- Conservative, careful, talented, ambitious.
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- Highly creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These traits seem to align more strongly with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Specifically, enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly indicative of a computer science background. Conversely, a humanities professor might be more likely to enjoy writing or other forms of creative expression typical of the humanities.

Since these traits are more characteristic of a computer science professor, it is reasonable to estimate that the likelihood of Jason being a computer science professor given these traits is higher.

We need to make an informed estimate of the conditional probabilities based on the traits:
- \( P(descr|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor—let’s estimate it as high, say 0.9.
- \( P(descr|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor—let’s estimate it as low, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|descr) = \frac{P(descr|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(descr|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(descr|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|descr) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|descr) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|descr) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|descr) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \[
\boxed{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
