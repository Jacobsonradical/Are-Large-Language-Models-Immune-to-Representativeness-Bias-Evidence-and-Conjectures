To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can set it up:

Given:
- 25 professors are from computer science.
- 75 professors are from the humanities.

We need to consider the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor and given he is a humanities professor. Since Jason's interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles) are more aligned with computer science, we will assume P(description | computer science professor) > P(description | humanities professor).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Similarly, the probability for humanities professors is considered as well.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (since Jason's traits fit well with CS)
- \( P(D | Humanities) = 0.1 \) (since Jason's traits fit poorly with humanities)

Applying these to Bayes' Theorem:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Humanities) = 0.75 \]

2. Calculate the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) \times P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

3. Calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the formatted answer:
{"probability": "0.75"}
