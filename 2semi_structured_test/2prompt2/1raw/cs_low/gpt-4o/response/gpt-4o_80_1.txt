To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the solution step-by-step:

1. Identify the prior probabilities:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \), is 25%. This is because there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities, \( P(H) \), is 75%.

2. Evaluate the likelihoods based on the description of Jason:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   & \text{Likelihood of description | Computer Science (} P(D|CS) \text{): Let's assume a high likelihood here, as his interests align strongly with computer science traits. For simplicity, we assume it is 0.9}. \\
   & \text{Likelihood of description | Humanities (} P(D|H) \text{): Let's assume this is less likely, due to his lack of interest in drawing or writing. For simplicity, we assume it is 0.1}.
   \end{align*}
   \]

3. Calculate the normalizing constant (total probability of the description, \( P(D) \)):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.9 * 0.25 + 0.1 * 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

4. Apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is 0.75.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
