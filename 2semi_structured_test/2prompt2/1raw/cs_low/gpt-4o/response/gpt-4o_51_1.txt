Sure, to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total professors: 100

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Humanities) \), the likelihoods that a professor described as Jason comes from either group.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically aligned with computer science. Given no detailed statistics on the base rates of these activities in either field, but given this stereotype, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.80 \) (a high probability because his interests align well with CS)
- \( P(D | Humanities) = 0.10 \) (a low probability because his interests misalign with humanities)

Now calculate \( P(D) \), which is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.80 \times 0.25) + (0.10 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.20 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Finally, calculating \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.20}{0.275} \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727. 

Therefore, the answer would be:

{"probability": "0.727"}
