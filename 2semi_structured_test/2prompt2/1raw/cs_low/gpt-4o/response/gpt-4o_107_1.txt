Given the description of Jason, we need to update our probability estimate of whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on his characteristics.

Let's start by noting the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor:

1. There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
2. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
3. The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the given description. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors. Additionally, his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing further supports this.

To update our probabilities, we apply Bayes' theorem. We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given each type of professor:

1. \( P(description | CS) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor. Let's assume this is high, say 0.9, because his interests strongly align with typical computer science activities.
2. \( P(description | Hum) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor. Let's assume this is low, say 0.1, because his interests do not align well with typical humanities activities.

Now, we calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.3 \]

Then, the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
