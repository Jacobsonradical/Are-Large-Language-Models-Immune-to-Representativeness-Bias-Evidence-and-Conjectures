To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let:
- \( CS \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors ( \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) ).
- There are 75 humanities professors ( \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) ).

The description of Jason includes characteristics that might influence the probability, such as his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors.

Next, we will denote:
- \( E \) as the event described in the personality profile of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description.

To solve this:

1. **Estimate \( P(E|CS) \):** Jason's fondness for coding and mathematical puzzles suggests a high probability for computer science. Let's arbitrarily estimate \( P(E|CS) \) to be a relatively high probability, say \( 0.9 \).

2. **Estimate \( P(E|H) \):** The probability that a humanities professor enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles is likely lower. Let's arbitrarily estimate \( P(E|H) \) to be \( 0.1 \).

3. ** Calculate \( P(E) \):**
\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|E) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.
