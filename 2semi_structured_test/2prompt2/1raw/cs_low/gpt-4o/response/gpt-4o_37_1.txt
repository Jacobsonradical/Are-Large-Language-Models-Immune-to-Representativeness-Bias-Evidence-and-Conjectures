To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
    - Let \( P(CS) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor.
    - Let \( P(H) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor.
    Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
    - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
    - Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
    - Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

   Without the exact probabilities, we need to make educated assessments. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more strongly associated with computer science than humanities. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \).

3. **Formulating Bayes' theorem:**
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
    \]

4. **Estimates:**
   - Given that Jason's interests are strongly associated with computer science, let's estimate:
     - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood for a computer science professor)
     - \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (low likelihood for a humanities professor)

5. **Calculating posterior probability:**
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
    \]
    \[
    P(CS|D) \approx 0.571
    \]

So, the posterior probability is approximately 0.571.
