To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Given that the description matches characteristics often associated with computer science (like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles), we can use this information to update our initial probability.

Here are the steps and relevant calculations:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \(P(\text{CS})\):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \(P(\text{H})\):
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability that a professor with Jason’s description is from computer science, \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\). Let's assume this is high due to characteristics like enjoying coding and solving puzzles.
   - Probability that a professor with Jason’s description is from the humanities, \(P(\text{Description}|\text{H})\). This would likely be lower due to the specific interests pointed out in the description.

Since exact likelihood values aren't given, we will assume:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   - The posterior probability \(P(\text{CS}|\text{Description})\) is given by:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}
     \]

Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
   \]

Thus the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
