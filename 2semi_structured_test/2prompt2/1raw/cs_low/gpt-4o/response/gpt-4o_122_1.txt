To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(D | CS) \)
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(D | H) \)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - We are looking for \( P(CS | D) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Also,
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given Jasonâ€™s interests and personality traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, dislike for drawing/writing), he seems more likely to be a computer scientist than a humanities professor. Since this is a qualitative assessment without exact numerical likelihoods, we'll make an educated guess based on the description being more indicative of a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

Using these estimates:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now we can compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
