To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) \) (the prior probability Jason is a computer science professor) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We need to evaluate how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Without exact numerical likelihoods, we must use qualitative assessment based on common characteristics:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities more associated with computer science professors.
- Given that he's not interested in drawing or writing, it aligns more closely with activities that are less typical in the humanities.

Given this qualitative lean, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor) is relatively high.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor) is relatively low.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
