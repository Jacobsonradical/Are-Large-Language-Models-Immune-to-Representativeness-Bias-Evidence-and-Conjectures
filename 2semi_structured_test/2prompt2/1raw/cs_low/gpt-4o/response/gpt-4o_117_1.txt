To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here, Jason's description includes traits that might be indicative of either group of professors, but some traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) might lean more towards computer science professors. 

First, let's note the prior probabilities:
- P(CS): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor = number of computer science professors / total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25
- P(H): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor = number of humanities professors / total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- P(D|CS): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- P(D|H): The probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given his interests, we might assume:
- Coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly indicative of computer science, not so much for humanities.
- Enjoying jogging is neutral.
- Highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing might lean towards computer science since creativity in CS can manifest in different ways other than traditional artistic ventures.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
- P(D|CS) = 0.8 (high given his interests align well with computer science)
- P(D|H) = 0.2 (low given his interests do not align as closely with typical humanities interests)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.57 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.57"}
