To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

1. Calculate the priors:
   - There are 25 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - There are 75 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. Given the description, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it's reasonable to assume that these traits are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore:
   - Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability that a computer science professor fits the description).
   - Let's assume \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low probability that a humanities professor fits the description).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the estimates:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.75.
