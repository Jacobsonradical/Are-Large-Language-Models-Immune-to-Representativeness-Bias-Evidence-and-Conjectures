To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, we determine the priors:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that a professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a professor is from humanities.

Given there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors. Therefore, we might assume:
\[ P(D|C) > P(D|H) \]

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.9 \] 
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \] 

(These numbers are assumptions based on the typical characteristics provided.)

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.6 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.6.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
