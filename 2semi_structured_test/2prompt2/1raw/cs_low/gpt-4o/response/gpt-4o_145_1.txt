To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. In this case, we have:

- \(P(A|B)\): The probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(A)\): The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\): The total probability of Jason's description, considering both computer science and humanities professors.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Prior probability \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (The probability of selecting a computer science professor).
- \(P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (The probability of selecting a humanities professor).

Now, let’s analyze how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Since Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles strongly align with typical computer science characteristics and less so with typical humanities characteristics, we can assume:

- \(P(B|A)\) (The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor) is relatively high.
- \(P(B|A')\) (The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor) is relatively low.

While not exact, we can make educated estimates. For instance, let’s assign:
- \(P(B|A) = 0.8\)
- \(P(B|A') = 0.2\)

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \(P(B)\) is the total probability of B, calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Substituting the values we assumed and calculated:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, calculating \(P(A|B)\):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore,
