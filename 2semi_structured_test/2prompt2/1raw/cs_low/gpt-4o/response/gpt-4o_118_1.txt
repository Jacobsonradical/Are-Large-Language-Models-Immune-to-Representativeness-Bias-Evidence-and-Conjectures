To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods based on the description provided:
- \( P(description | CS) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(description | Hum) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

The description mentioned several traits and interests more closely aligned with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles). Let's estimate these probabilities as follows:
- \( P(description | CS) \): High, let's assume it is around 0.8.
- \( P(description | Hum) \): Low, let's assume it is around 0.2.

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
