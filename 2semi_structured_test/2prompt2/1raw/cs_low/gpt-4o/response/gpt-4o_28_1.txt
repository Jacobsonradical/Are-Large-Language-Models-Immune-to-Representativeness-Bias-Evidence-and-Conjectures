To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to set up the prior and likelihoods based on the information provided:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS) and P(H))**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood (P(description|CS) and P(description|H))**:
   - The likelihood that a computer science professor would be described like Jason (P(description|CS)).
   - The likelihood that a humanities professor would be described like Jason (P(description|H)).

The description suggests that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science professors. Hence, without precise values, we can infer that:
   - P(description|CS) is likely to be higher than P(description|H).

Since exact probabilities are not provided, we can make an educated estimation about the likelihoods. For example, we might assume:
   - P(description|CS) = 0.8 (high because coding and math puzzles are strongly associated with CS)
   - P(description|H) = 0.2 (low because coding and math puzzles are less associated with humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
