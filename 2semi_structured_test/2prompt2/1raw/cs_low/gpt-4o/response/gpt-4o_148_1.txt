To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Given the following details:
- The number of computer science professors (CS) is 25.
- The number of humanities professors (H) is 75.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' theorem can be stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (B).

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   We need to estimate how likely Jason's description fits with being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. While this involves subjective judgment, let's consider the following:
   - Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing strongly suggest he is more likely a computer science professor.
   - Suppose we assign a subjective likelihood of \( P(\text{B|CS}) = 0.9 \) (highly likely) and \( P(\text{B|H}) = 0.1 \) (unlikely).

3. **Marginal probability (normalizing constant):**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

4. **Posterior probability:**
   \[ P(\text{CS|B}) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS|B}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS|B}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS|B}) = 0.75 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:
