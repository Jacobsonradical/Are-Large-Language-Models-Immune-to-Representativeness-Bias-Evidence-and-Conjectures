To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, letâ€™s define:

1. \( P(\text{CS}) \): Prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(\text{H}) \): Prior probability that a professor is from the humanities.
3. \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \): Likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
4. \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \): Likelihood of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
5. \( P(\text{Description}) \): Overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
  
Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description|CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description|CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description|H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

1. \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
2. \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

If we make reasonable assumptions about the likelihoods based on the description (using qualitative judgment):
- Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (which are more common in CS faculties than humanities), we assume \(P(\text{Description|CS})\) to be significantly higher than \(P(\text{Description|H})\).

Say, for example, \(P(\text{Description|CS}) = 0.8\) and \(P(\text{Description|H}) = 0.2\) (you can adjust these proportions based on your own judgment).

Now plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{0.2}{(0.2) + (0.15)} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given this description is approximately 0.5714, with the relevant assumption.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
