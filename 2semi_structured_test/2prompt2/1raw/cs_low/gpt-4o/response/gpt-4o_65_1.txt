To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update the probability estimates as more evidence is provided.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E | CS) \) as the probability of the description \( E \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | H) \) as the probability of the description \( E \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(E | CS) \) and \( P(E | H) \), but this concerns interpreting the description relative to each field.

Given the description for Jason:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles are activities more typical for a computer science professor.
- Traits like being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious could be found in both fields, but the activities are more skewed.

Given this information:
- Let's assign a subjective higher probability to \( P(E | CS) \), say 0.7.
- Let's assign a subjective lower probability to \( P(E | H) \), say 0.3.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the description E, given by:
\[
P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.175 + 0.225
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.4
\]

Thus,
\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.4}
\]
\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{0.175}{0.4}
\]
\[
P(CS | E) = 0.4375
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.4375"}
