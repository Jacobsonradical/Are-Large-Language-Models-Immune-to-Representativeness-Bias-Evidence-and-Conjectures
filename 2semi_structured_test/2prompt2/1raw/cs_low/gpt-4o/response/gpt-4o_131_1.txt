Based on the provided description of Jason, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our probability given this specific information. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Computer Science \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from Humanities \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to consider the likelihood of Jason's characteristics given that he is a computer science professor \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) and the likelihood given that he is a humanities professor \( P(\text{Description} | H) \).

Given the description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more commonly traits associated with a computer science professor.
- The lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing aligns less with the typical traits of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assign probabilities to these likelihoods:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (very likely for a CS professor)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | H) \approx 0.1 \) (less likely for a Humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

Let's plug in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

Therefore,
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
