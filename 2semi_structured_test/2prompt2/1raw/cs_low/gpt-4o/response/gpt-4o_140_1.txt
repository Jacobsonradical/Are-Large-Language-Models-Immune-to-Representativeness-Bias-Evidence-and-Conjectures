The scenario describes a Bayesian inference problem where we are asked to update our beliefs about whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on the given description.

We start by considering the prior probabilities:

- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(Hum) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we consider the likelihood of the provided description given each profession. Factors such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing make it more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let's denote the provided description as \( D \).

- Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \) is higher. Let's assume it is quite high, say 0.8.
- Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor \( P(D|Hum) \) is lower. Let's assume it is much lower, say 0.2.

We now use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the assumed probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
