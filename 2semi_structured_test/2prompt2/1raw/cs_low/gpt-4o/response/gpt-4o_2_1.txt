To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll start by identifying the relevant prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- Probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor, \( P(H) \):
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Likelihoods:
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \).
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \).

Without exact descriptions of how likely Jason's characteristics are among the groups, we make educated guesses based on his interests and traits.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors. Therefore, we may assume:

\[ P(D | CS) \text{ is relatively high (let's assume it to be 0.8, for instance)} \]
\[ P(D | H) \text{ is relatively low (let's assume it to be 0.2, for instance)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in our assumed values:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

\[
{"probability": "0.571"}
