To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(\text{H})\)):
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   We need to estimate the likelihood of the observed description given that the professor is in computer science (\(P(D|\text{CS})\)) versus the likelihood given that the professor is in the humanities (\(P(D|\text{H})\)):
   - Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common traits among computer scientists than humanities professors, we will assume:
     \[
     P(D|\text{CS}) > P(D|\text{H})
     \]
   For the sake of simplicity, suppose:
   \[
   P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \quad \text{and} \quad P(D|\text{H}) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}
   \]
   Putting in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
