To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( T \) as the description Traits given.

We need to find \( P(CS|T) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{P(T|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. Given 25 out of 100 professors are from computer science, \( P(CS) = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities. Given 75 out of 100 professors are from humanities, \( P(H) = 0.75 \).

To compute \( P(T) \) (the total probability of the description), we need:
\[ P(T) = P(T|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(T|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Next, we estimate:
- \( P(T|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Based on his interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being conservative, careful, and ambitious, \( P(T|CS) \) is likely to be high. Let's assume \( P(T|CS) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(T|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. Given his lack of interest in drawing or writing and preference for activities typical of a computer science background, \( P(T|H) \) is likely lower. Let's assume \( P(T|H) = 0.2 \).

Now, we can calculate \( P(T) \):
\[ P(T) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.35 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(CS|T) \):
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.5714.
