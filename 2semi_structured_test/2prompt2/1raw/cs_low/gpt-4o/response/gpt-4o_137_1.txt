To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the prior probability of an event with the likelihood of observing new evidence.

First we establish the prior probabilities:
- Probability of a professor being from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of a professor being from the humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next we determine the likelihood of the description given these probabilities.

Given the description emphasizes Jasonâ€™s enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles:
- We can reasonably infer that these traits are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.
- Thus, we can assume \( P(description \mid CS) \) is higher than \( P(description \mid Hum) \).

Let's denote:
- \( P(description \mid CS) = 0.8 \) (a high likelihood for computer science professors)
- \( P(description \mid Hum) = 0.2 \) (a low likelihood for humanities professors)

Now using Bayes' Theorem, we compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS \mid description) = \frac{P(description \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) \) is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(description) = P(description \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(description \mid Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ = 0.35 \]

Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid description) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore,
