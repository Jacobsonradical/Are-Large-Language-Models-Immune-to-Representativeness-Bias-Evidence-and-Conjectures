To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem tells us how to update our initial beliefs (the prior probability) based on new evidence (the likelihood).

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to determine how likely the description of Jason is for both computer science and humanities professors based on the given traits. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it seems more likely for these traits to be associated with a computer science professor.

3. **Posterior Calculation** using Bayes' Theorem:
   Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) is the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

4. **Estimating the Likelihoods**:
   Without concrete data on the likelihoods, we would assume a reasonable estimate based on the description. Letâ€™s assign:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \)
   This implies that the description is 4 times more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

5. **Calculating the Posterior**:
   Using:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

   Thus:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.
