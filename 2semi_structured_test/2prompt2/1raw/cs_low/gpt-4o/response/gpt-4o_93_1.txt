To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

First, let's specify the values:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   (\( \neg A \) denotes Jason being a humanities professor.)

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - The likelihood of the description, given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A) \), considers traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typical. Suppose we assign a high probability due to the traits aligning well. Let's consider this to be high, say 0.8.

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - The likelihood of the description, given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(B|\neg A) \), considers these traits aligning less typically with humanities professors. Letâ€™s assume this probability to be low, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
