To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' Theorem tells us that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we'll define the probabilities:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description includes traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more characteristic of a computer science professor. Assuming these traits significantly tilt the likelihood towards computer science:

We'll assume \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high, say 0.9, and \( P(D|H) \) is comparatively low, say 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.6"} \]
