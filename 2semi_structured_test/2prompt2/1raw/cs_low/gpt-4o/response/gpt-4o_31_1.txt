To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability based on new evidence.

First, let's define:

- \( P(\text{C}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{H}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E|\text{C}) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|\text{H}) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(\text{C}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate \( P(E|\text{C}) \) and \( P(E|\text{H}) \):
- Based on the description, Jason seems to exhibit traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. So, \( P(E|\text{C}) \) is likely to be higher than \( P(E|\text{H}) \).

For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:
- \( P(E|\text{C}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E|\text{H}) = 0.2 \)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C})}{P(E|\text{C}) \cdot P(\text{C}) + P(E|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})} \]

Plugging the values in:
\[ P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{C}|E) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(\text{C}|E) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.
