Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our prior beliefs about the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description. Let's denote:

- \( CS = \text{Jason is a computer science professor} \)
- \( H = \text{Jason is a humanities professor} \)

We are given:

- The prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid D) \) where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming that Jason's description matches more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, and denoting the likelihoods:

- \( P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.1 \)

These likelihoods reflect that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common traits for a computer science professor.

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\{ "probability": "0.75" \}
