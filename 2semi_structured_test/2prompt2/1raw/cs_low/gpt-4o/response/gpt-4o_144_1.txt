To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the description (B) if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing the description (B).

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) \) : Probability that the description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(A_{\text{H}}) \) : Probability that the description is of a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.

Thus,
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{H}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let's consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \):
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \): Likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A_{\text{H}}) \): Likelihood of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

From the description, characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, along with being highly creative but in a non-artistic way, are more suggestive of a computer science professor.

Letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.9 \] 
\[ P(B|A_{\text{H}}) = 0.1 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}})P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{H}})P(A_{\text{H}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
