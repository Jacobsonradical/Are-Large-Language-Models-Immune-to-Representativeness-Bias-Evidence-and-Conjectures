To solve this problem, I'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. 

Here, we need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS | T) \), where \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( T \) is the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(T | CS) \)**: The probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
   - Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are traits usually associated with computer science professors.
   - Let's denote this likelihood as \( L_{CS} \). 

4. **Likelihood \( P(T | H) \)**: The probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor.
   - Jason's traits, such as not enjoying drawing or writing, and his interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, are less typical of humanities professors.
   - Let's denote this likelihood as \( L_{H} \). 

Since the specific numerical likelihoods \( L_{CS} \) and \( L_{H} \) are not provided, I will make the reasonable assumption that Jason’s description is considerably more likely if he is a computer science professor than if he is a humanities professor. Suppose \( L_{CS} = 0.9 \) and \( L_{H} = 0.1 \) as educated guesses (these values could be different based on more specific data about how likely such descriptions are).

5. **Calculate the Normalizing Constant \( P(T) \)**: The total probability of the description \( T \).
   \[ P(T) = P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(T | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(T) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(T) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(T) = 0.3 \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(CS | T) \)**:
   \[ P(CS | T) = \frac{P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]
   \[ P(CS | T) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(CS | T) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(CS | T) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
