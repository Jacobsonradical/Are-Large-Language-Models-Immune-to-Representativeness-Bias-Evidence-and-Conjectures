Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Firstly, we understand that we have the following priors:
- The probability that a described individual is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( 25/100 = 0.25 \)
- The probability that a described individual is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( 75/100 = 0.75 \)

Now, for the descriptions, we assume that the traits mentioned (interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing) are more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote the given description as \( D \).

We aim to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

To simplify, we also need \( P(D|H) \):

\[ 
P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

Now combining these two:

\[ 
1 = P(CS|D) + P(H|D)
\]

Thus:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

We need to assign likelihoods:
- Let's assume that the probability that the description fits a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) is high (e.g., 0.90).
- Let's assume the probability for a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)) is lower (e.g., 0.10).

Substituting these values into the Bayes' Theorem formula:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.25}{(0.90 \cdot 0.25) + (0.10 \cdot 0.75)}
\]

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
\]

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.300}
\]

\[ 
P(CS|D) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
