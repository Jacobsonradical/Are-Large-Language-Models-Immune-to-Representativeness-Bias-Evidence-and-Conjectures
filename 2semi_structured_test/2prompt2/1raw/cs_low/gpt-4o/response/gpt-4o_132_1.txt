To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it is more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given his interests and traits).
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (lower likelihood given his interests contrast with typical humanities interests).

Now, applying the numbers to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately \( 0.727 \).

Answer:
{"probability": "0.727"}
