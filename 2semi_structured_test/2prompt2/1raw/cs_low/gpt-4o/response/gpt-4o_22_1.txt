To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the data and the description of Jason, we need to calculate the likelihood of him being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given Data:
- Number of computer science professors (CSP): 25
- Number of humanities professors (HP): 75
- Total professors (T): 100

\[ P(CSP) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(HP) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CSP | D) = \frac{P(D | CSP) \cdot P(CSP)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CSP | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D | CSP) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CSP) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description (D).

Since we need \( P(D) \), it can be expanded as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CSP) \cdot P(CSP) + P(D | HP) \cdot P(HP) \]

Suppose we consider the likelihoods based on Jason's description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which might be more associated with computer science professors.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may be less typical for humanities professors.

To simplify, assume:
\[ P(D | CSP) = 0.8 \] and
\[ P(D | HP) = 0.2 \]

These are hypothetical values chosen to indicate more relevance for CSP traits.

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CSP | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CSP | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CSP | D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
