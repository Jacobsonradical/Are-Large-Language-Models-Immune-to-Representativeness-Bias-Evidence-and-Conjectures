To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is calculated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided about Jason.

First, let's define the probabilities needed:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description being given Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

### Defining the Prior:

- The total number of professors is 100 (25 computer science + 75 humanities).
- Prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) since Jason could reasonably be either, given no other information.

### Describing \( P(B|A) \):

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles which are traits more commonly associated with computer science professors.

- Let's assume the probability of a computer science professor fitting this description is high, say, \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \).

### Describing \( P(B|¬A) \):

For the humanities professors, this description seems less likely because it heavily involves coding and mathematical puzzles, which are less likely interests for humanities professors.

- Let's assume the probability of a humanities professor fitting this description is low, say, \( P(B|¬A) \approx 0.2 \).

### Calculating \( P(B) \):

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A) \]

Where \( P(¬A) \) is the probability of Jason being a humanities professor:

\[ P(¬A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So:

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
