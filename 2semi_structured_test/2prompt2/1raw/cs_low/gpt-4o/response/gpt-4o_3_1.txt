Based on the given description, we need to update our prior beliefs (base rates) about the probability of Jason being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, using the given traits and interests as evidence.

### Base Rates
- Number of Computer Science Professors: 25
- Number of Humanities Professors: 75

From these, the prior probabilities are:
- Probability of being in Computer Science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being in Humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

### Likelihoods
Next, we consider the likelihood of the provided description, given the two possible categories.

Jason's traits:
- Age: 45 years old
- Marital status: married
- Family: five children
- Personality: conservative, careful, talented, ambitious
- Hobbies: coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging
- Enjoys not: drawing, writing

On closer examination, several traits strongly suggest Jason could be affiliated with computer science:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles are directly aligned with characteristics typical of computer science professors.
- Disinterest in drawing or writing leans away from typical humanities interests.

Without specific statistics on the distribution of these traits, we'd use intuitive approximations:
- Let's estimate the likelihood that a computer science professor matches this description, denoted as \( P(D \mid CS) \), to be very high, say 0.9.
- Likelihood that a humanities professor matches this description, \( P(D \mid H) \), would be significantly lower, say 0.1.

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' theorem gives the posterior probability we seek:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting in our values,
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Then,
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
