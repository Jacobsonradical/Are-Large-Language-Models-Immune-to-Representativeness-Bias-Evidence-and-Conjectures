To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is defined as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description among all professors.

First, let's determine each of these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability ( \( P(A) \) )**:
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability ( \( P(\neg A) \) )**:
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood ( \( P(B|A) \) )**:
   This is the probability that Jason's description matches a typical computer science professor. Given Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science, this probability is intuitively quite high. Let's assume itâ€™s 0.9 based on common stereotypes and behaviour patterns typical of computer science professionals.

4. **Complement Likelihood ( \( P(B|\neg A) \) )**:
   This is the probability that Jason's description matches a typical humanities professor. Considering humanities professors typically do not engage much in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, this probability might be assumed to be quite low. Let's conservatively estimate it to be 0.1.

5. **Total Probability ( \( P(B) \) )**:
   This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
