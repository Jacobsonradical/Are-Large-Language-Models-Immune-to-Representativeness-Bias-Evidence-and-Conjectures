To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of observing the description of Jason given the two possible groups (computer science professors and humanities professors).

Let's define:
- \( H_{CS} \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{Hum} \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{Hum}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H_{Hum}) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

First, establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 25 + 75 = 100.

So:
\[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(D | H_{Hum}) \). Given the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are attributes more strongly associated with computer science professors. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of observing this description is higher for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor.

Let’s make an educated estimate:
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood since his interests align with computer science).
- \( P(D | H_{Hum}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood since his interests do not align well with humanities).

Now, apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Then:
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
