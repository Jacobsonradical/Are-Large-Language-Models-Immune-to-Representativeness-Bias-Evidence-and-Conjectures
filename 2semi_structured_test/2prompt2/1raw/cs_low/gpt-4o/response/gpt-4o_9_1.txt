To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description given for Jason.

We are interested in \(P(C \mid D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D \mid C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - Similarly, \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - We need to assess how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   - Based on the traits described (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more likely that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume the following (subjective) likelihoods based on the description:
   - \(P(D \mid C) = 0.9\) (high likelihood Jason fits the computer science profile).
   - \(P(D \mid H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood Jason fits the humanities profile).

3. **Total Probability** \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

4. **Posterior Probability** \(P(C \mid D)\):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
