To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on the evidence.

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100 (25 computer science + 75 humanities)
- Description of Jason, indicating traits that might be more common among computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) = \text{Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.} \)
- \( P(H) = \text{Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.} \)
- \( P(Description | CS) = \text{Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.} \)
- \( P(Description | H) = \text{Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.} \)
- \( P(Description) = \text{Overall probability of the description.} \)

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Assumptions and estimates:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these activities are generally more associated with computer science professors. Hence, we estimate:
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is relatively high, let's assume it might be 0.8.
- \( P(Description | H) \) is relatively low, let's assume it might be 0.2.

Now, we calculate \( P(Description) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.571 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
