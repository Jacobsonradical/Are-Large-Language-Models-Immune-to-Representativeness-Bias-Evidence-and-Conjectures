To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. First, let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

### Step 1: Determine the priors

The number of computer science professors is 25, and the number of humanities professors is 75.

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Step 2: Estimate the likelihoods

Based on the description, Jason seems more inclined towards activities that are generally associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than the humanities. Let's denote:

- \( P(D|C) \): High probability (we will estimate this to be 0.9 for an intuitive sense, as the description strongly fits the profile of a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|H) \): Lower probability (we will estimate this to be 0.1, as the description does not commonly fit a humanities professor).

### Step 3: Calculate the total probability \( P(D) \)

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' theorem

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
