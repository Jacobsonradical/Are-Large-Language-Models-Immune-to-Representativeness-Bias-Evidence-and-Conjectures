To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case:

- Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) denote the provided description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's compute the priors:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]

We need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description:

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely associated with a computer science professor.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are typically more associated with humanities professors.

Given these traits, we could reasonably assume:

\[ P(D|C) \] is relatively high, let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the description matches traits common in computer science).
\[ P(D|H) \] is relatively low, let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood given the described traits are less common in humanities).

Given this information:

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.571 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.571 \).
