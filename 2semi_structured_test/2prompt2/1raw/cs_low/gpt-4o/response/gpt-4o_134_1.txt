To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s how we can break down the problem:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities: P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let's denote Jason's traits as \( T \). We need to assess the likelihood of these traits given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(T|CS) \), and given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(T|H) \).

Given Jason's traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), the traits are more consistent with a computer science professor. Therefore, we assume:

\[ P(T|CS) > P(T|H) \]

Let’s assume, based on subjective judgment, that:
\[ P(T|CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(T|H) = 0.2 \]

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{P(T|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]

Where \( P(T) \) is the total probability of the traits \( T \):

\[ P(T) = P(T|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(T|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.35 \]

Now, plug in the values:

\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|T) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|T) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
