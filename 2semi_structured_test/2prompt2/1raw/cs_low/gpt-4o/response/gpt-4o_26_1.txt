To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the following:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) = the given description of Jason

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we calculate the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(A^C) \):
\[ P(A^C) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

For the likelihoods, let's denote:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his conservative personality, it seems more aligned with the typical traits of a computer science professor. Thus, let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) \) > \( P(B|A^C) \)

While we donâ€™t have exact values, let's suppose:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood description for a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A^C) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood description for a humanities professor)

Now we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^C) \cdot P(A^C) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is roughly 0.571, which can be given as:
