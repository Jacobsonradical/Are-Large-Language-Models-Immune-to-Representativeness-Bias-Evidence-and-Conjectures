To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities is \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

First, identify the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \), which represent the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. This is based on the given characteristics such as enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and the dislike of drawing and writing.

Considering the description of Jason, these characteristics seem more aligned with the profession in computer science, especially enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = p_1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = p_2 \)

Given that Jason enjoys activities strongly associated with computer science and less so with humanities, it is reasonable to assume \( p_1 \) is higher than \( p_2 \). For simplicity, let's hypothesize \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.8 \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 0.2 \), knowing \( p_1 \) should be significantly higher but not necessarily the exact values due to lack of exact information.

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.

Here is the answer in the required format:
