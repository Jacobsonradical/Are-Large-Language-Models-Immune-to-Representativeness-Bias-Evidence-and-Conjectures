To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to know the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason's description matches.

We want to calculate \( P(A|B) \).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to determine each of these probabilities.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. The description mentions coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which seems more aligned with the typical activities of a computer science professor. Let's assume this probability is relatively high. For the sake of calculation, let's arbitrarily assign \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   This is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. The description of liking coding and mathematical puzzles seems less likely for a humanities professor. Let’s assume this probability is relatively low. For the sake of calculation, let’s arbitrarily assign \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

5. **Total probability \( P(B) \)**:
   This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 or 75%.
