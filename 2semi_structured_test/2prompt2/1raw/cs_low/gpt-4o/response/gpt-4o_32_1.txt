To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. For this calculation, we need the following information:

1. **Prior probability** (\(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\)): The proportion of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample.
2. **Likelihood** (\(P(D|A)\) and \(P(D|B)\)): The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Let \(A\) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(B\) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor. The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are stronger indicators for a computer science professor (A).

Assuming the following likelihood ratios (hypothetical but reasonable estimates based on the description):
\[ P(D|A) = 0.8 \] 
\[ P(D|B) = 0.2 \]

We use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
