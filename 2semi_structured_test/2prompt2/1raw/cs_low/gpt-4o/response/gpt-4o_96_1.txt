To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(A) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- P(B) is the overall probability of getting this description, regardless of the type of professor.

First, we establish the prior probability (P(A)):
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, P(A) = 25 / 100 = 0.25.

Next, we need to consider the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (P(B|A)). While we don't have exact figures, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the description provided:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science professors.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are less pertinent to humanities professors.

Considering these details, it is reasonable to assume P(B|A) is high.

Then, we consider the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, P(B|¬A). This is likely lower because Jason's interests align more with what we might expect of a computer science professor. 

Let’s assume:
- P(B|A) = 0.9 (high probability that the description fits a computer science professor)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (lower probability that the description fits a humanities professor)

The probability of the description overall (P(B)):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.2 * 0.75)
     = 0.225 + 0.15
     = 0.375

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.9 * 0.25) / 0.375
       = 0.225 / 0.375
       = 0.6

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.6, or 60%.
