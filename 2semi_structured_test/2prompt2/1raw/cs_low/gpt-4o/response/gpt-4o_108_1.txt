Given the information provided and the description of Jason, the goal is to estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. But first, let's consider some important aspects:

1. **Base rates (prior probabilities):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - These constitute the prior probabilities: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Jason's traits are described as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These traits suggest a higher likelihood for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor.

Even though we don't have explicit likelihood numbers, we can infer that traits like coding and solving mathematical puzzles are stronger indicators of being a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume the likelihoods:

- \( P(Jason's Traits | CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(Jason's Traits | Hum) = 0.2 \)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason's Traits) = \frac{P(Jason's Traits | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason's Traits)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Jason's Traits) = P(Jason's Traits | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason's Traits | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Let's calculate \( P(Jason's Traits) \):
\[ P(Jason's Traits) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Then,
\[ P(CS | Jason's Traits) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

Thus, the formatted answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.571"}
