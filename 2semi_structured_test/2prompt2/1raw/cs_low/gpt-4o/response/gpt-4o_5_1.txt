To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H))): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - Probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))

Given the specifics in Jason's description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it seems more aligned with typical interests of a computer science professor. Let's assume:
   - \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\) (highly likely such description comes from a CS professor)
   - \(P(D|H) = 0.1\) (less likely such description comes from a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior Probability:**

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the assumed probabilities:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
