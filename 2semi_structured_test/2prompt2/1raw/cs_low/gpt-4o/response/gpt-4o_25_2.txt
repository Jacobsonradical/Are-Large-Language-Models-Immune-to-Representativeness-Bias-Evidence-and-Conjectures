To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we get the description of Jason.

First, we need to determine the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Jason’s description.

### Step 1: Compute the Prior Probability
Out of 100 professors, 25 are computer science professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Compute the Likelihood
We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor).

The description indicates that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely to be traits associated with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Additionally, his disinterest in drawing or writing further tilts the likelihood towards computer science. While precise values would ideally come from more specific data, for estimation purposes, we'll assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]

### Step 3: Compute the Overall Probability of the Description
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes’ Theorem
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Hence, our posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
