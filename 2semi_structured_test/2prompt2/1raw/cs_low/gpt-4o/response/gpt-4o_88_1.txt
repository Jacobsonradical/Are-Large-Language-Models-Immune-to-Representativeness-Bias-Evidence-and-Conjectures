To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) represent the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description, considering both computer science and humanities professors.

Let's calculate each component step-by-step:

### Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):
Jason is chosen randomly from the whole sample of 100 professors, which includes 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)):
Next, we need to estimate the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Jason's traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles closely align with typical computer science interests.

Let's assume, hypothetically, that there is a high probability (e.g., 0.9) that such a description fits a computer science professor.

\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]

### Total Probability (\( P(B) \)):
This is the probability of Jason's description occurring among all professors, given by:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

From the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description fits less well with a typical humanities professor, so let's assume a reasonable but lower probability (e.g., 0.1) for this case.

\[ P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, combining all parts:

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

### Posterior Probability (\( P(A|B) \)) Calculation:
Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
