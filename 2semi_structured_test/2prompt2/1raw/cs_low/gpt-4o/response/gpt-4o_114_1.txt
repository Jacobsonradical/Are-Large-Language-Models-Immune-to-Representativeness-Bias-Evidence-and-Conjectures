To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a step-by-step approach to calculate it:

1. **Define the Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25.
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75.

2. **Determine the Likelihood:**
   We need the probability of observing Jason's characteristics given he is a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) and given he is a humanities professor (P(Description | H)). This requires subjective judgment or empirical data. Based on Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disliking drawing or writing, these traits seem more typical of a computer science professor. We'll assume:
   - P(Description | CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood these traits match a computer science professor).
   - P(Description | H) = 0.1 (low likelihood these traits match a humanities professor).

3. **Apply Bayes’ Theorem:**
   To find the posterior probability P(CS | Description), we use Bayes’ Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of observing the description:

   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   P(Description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

   Now calculate the posterior probability:

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
