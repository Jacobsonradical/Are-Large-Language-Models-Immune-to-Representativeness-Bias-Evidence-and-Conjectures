Given the description of Jason, we need to calculate the posterior probability that he is one of the computer science professors in the sample. 

We will use Bayes' theorem for this purpose. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( 75/100 = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities more aligned with the interests of computer science professors. We can reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A^c) \). 

Suppose \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (i.e., there's a high chance a computer science professor would fit Jason's description).
And, \( P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \) (i.e., there's a lesser chance a humanities professor would fit Jason's description).

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
