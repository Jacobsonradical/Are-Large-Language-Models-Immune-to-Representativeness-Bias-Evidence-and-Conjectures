To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability that the description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

For \( P(D) \), we need the total probability of the description occurring:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given the description, characteristics like enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggest a higher likelihood under computer science professors. Similarly, lack of interest in drawing or writing also aligns more with a computer science orientation than humanities. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:

- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood for a humanities professor)

Thus:

\[
P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now, applying these to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
