First, let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. The theorem can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

### Step by Step:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability (\( P(\neg A) \))**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:
     \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**:
   - The description suggests Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors.
   - Letâ€™s say the probability that a computer science professor matches the description is quite high. Suppose:
     \[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \] (This is an assumption based on the nature of the description)

4. **Complement Likelihood (\( P(B|\neg A) \))**:
   - The probability that a humanities professor matches the description seems lower, given the technical interests.
   - Suppose:
     \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \] (Another assumption)

5. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \))**:
   - Use the law of total probability:
     \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
     \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

6. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
     \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.57 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.57 \).
