To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the given evidence.

Given:
- The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we assess the likelihood of the evidence (Jason's description) for both groups. Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors, it suggests a higher likelihood for the computer science group.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The likelihood of a computer science professor fitting Jason's description (P(E | CS)) is high, let's say 0.9.
- The likelihood of a humanities professor fitting Jason's description (P(E | H)) is relatively low, let's say 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.375 \]

Now calculating \( P(CS | E) \):

\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | E) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.6.
