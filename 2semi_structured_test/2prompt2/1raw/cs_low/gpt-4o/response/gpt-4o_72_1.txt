Based on the description provided, several factors seem more aligned with typical interests and attributes that might be associated with a professor in computer science rather than the humanities. The interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly indicative of computer science, while the lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing might tilt the balance further away from the humanities.

To form a prior probability, we start with the fact that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, so the initial (prior) probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description and Jason's interests, Bayesian reasoning suggests updating our prior probabilities based on how characteristic the description is for each group. While the exact likelihood ratios aren't specified, we can reasonably assume that a profile with significant emphasis on computer science-related activities (coding, mathematical puzzles) would shift the probability towards computer science.

Suppose we assume the following (heuristically):
- Probability of such a description given a computer science professor: 0.9
- Probability of such a description given a humanities professor: 0.1

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid Humanities) \times P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Then the posterior probability is:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
