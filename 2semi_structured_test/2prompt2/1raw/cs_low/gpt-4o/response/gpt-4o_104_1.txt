To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A^c \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description given for Jason.

Given the sample, we know:
- The number of computer science professors (\( n_{\text{cs}} \)) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (\( n_{\text{hum}} \)) = 75
- The total number of professors (\( n_{\text{total}} \)) = 100

The prior probability \( P(A) \) is the proportion of computer science professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{n_{\text{cs}}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) is the proportion of humanities professors:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{n_{\text{hum}}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to estimate the likelihoods based on the description:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and he does not enjoy drawing or writing â€“ these traits are likely more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

Without specific numerical information on the likelihoods, we can assume that:
\[ P(B|A) \gg P(B|A^c) \]

To simplify, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \]

Now we can calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.
