To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description under all conditions.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior probability \( P(CS) \)**:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   This is because there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.

2. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)** (where H is humanities professors):
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(D | CS) \)**:
   The description fits traits stereotypically associated more closely with a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Although exact calculation would typically require more details about likelihoods, we can assume for simplicity that \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high, say 0.8.

4. **Likelihood \( P(D | H) \)**:
   Conversely, the description doesn't closely fit stereotypical traits of humanities professors based on the given description. Therefore, we assume \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low, say 0.2.

5. **Total probability \( P(D) \)**:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

Putting it all together:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571, or 57.1%.
