To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do that:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \), is expected to be relatively high because Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more with typical computer science activities.
   - The likelihood of observing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \), is expected to be lower because his interests are less typical for someone in the humanities.

For simplicity, let's assume these likelihoods as:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.90 \) (high likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.10 \) (low likelihood that a humanities professor fits Jason's description)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - By Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \) is given by:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Similarly, the probability \( P(\text{Description}) \) is given by:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \times P(\text{H})
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.90 \times 0.25) + (0.10 \times 0.75)
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 0.30
     \]

   - Finally, the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.25}{0.30}
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.30}
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.75
     \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
