The problem you're dealing with is essentially about probability, given certain evidence, often tackled within the framework of Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

To solve this, we will apply Bayes' Theorem, which can be expressed as:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

We can simplify this if we assume we don't have concrete probabilities (like exact numbers for \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \)) and focus on the prior probabilities and a qualitative assessment of the evidence.

1. **Prior Probability Calculation**:
   We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore:
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need to qualitatively assess the likelihoods based on Jason's description and leanings toward computer science or humanities traits. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These activities are more typically associated with attributes found in computer science professionals. While this is a subjective assessment, it is reasonable to assess that the description is more likely to be of a computer science professor.

Letâ€™s denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.2 \)

3. **Total Probability of Description**:
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.571"} \]
