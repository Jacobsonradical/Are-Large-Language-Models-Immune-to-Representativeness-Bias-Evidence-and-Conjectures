This problem is a classic application of Bayes' Theorem. We are given some prior information about the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample, and we need to update this based on the description provided.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.

From the given information, there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Thus,

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's define the likelihoods based on the description. We need to estimate:

- \( P(D \mid CS) \): the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. Let's assume:

- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is high since Jason enjoys activities that are commonly associated with computer science professors.

Assume that:
\[ P(D \mid CS) = 0.8 \]

For the humanities professors, these activities are less commonly associated:

Assume that:
\[ P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be computed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, compute \( P(CS \mid D) \):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is about 0.571.
