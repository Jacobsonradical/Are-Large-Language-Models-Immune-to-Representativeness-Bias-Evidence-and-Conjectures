To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.

Let's define our terms:
- \(P(CS \mid D)\): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D \mid CS)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H \mid D)\): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.
- \(P(D \mid H)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): The overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities (\(P(CS)\) and \(P(H)\)):
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \quad \text{and} \quad P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]

We need to estimate \(P(D \mid CS)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\). Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical traits for computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

Assume:
- \(P(D \mid CS) = 0.8\): High probability that a computer science professor matches the description.
- \(P(D \mid H) = 0.2\): Lower probability that a humanities professor matches the description.

Now, we can calculate \(P(D)\):
\[
P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

Finally, we calculate \(P(CS \mid D)\):
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.571"
\]
