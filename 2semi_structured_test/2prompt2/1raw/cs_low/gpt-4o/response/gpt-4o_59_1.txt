Given the description of Jason and the setup of the study, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior beliefs with the evidence provided.

First, establish the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)):
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, assess the likelihoods of the description given computer science versus humanities:

Given the description mentions traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging — and not enjoying drawing or writing, these traits seem to suggest a higher likelihood of fitting a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We’ll call these traits \(D\).

Let's estimate the likelihoods:
- The likelihood of the given description \(D\) among computer science professors (\(P(D|CS)\)) is possibly high. Let's assume this is around 0.8 (or 80% likely).
- The likelihood of the description among humanities professors (\(P(D|H)\)) might be considerably lower because they generally might be less oriented towards coding and mathematical puzzles. Let's assume this is around 0.2 (or 20% likely).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.571.
