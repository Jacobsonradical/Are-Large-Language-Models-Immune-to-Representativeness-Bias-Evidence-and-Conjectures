To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description B.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we calculate the prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) where Jason is in the humanities:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For simplicity, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Since the description favors traits commonly associated with computer science, let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood that a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description)

Now, we calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
