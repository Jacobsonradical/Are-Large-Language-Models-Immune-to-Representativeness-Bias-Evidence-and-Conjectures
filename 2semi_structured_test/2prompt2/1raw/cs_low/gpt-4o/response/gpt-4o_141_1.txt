To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Start by noting the prior probabilities and the likelihoods based on the given description.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
    - Probability (Computer Science | Prior) = \[ \frac{25}{100} \] = 0.25
    - Probability (Humanities | Prior) = \[ \frac{75}{100} \] = 0.75

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a Computer Science professor (P(Description | Computer Science Professor)) 
    - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a Humanities professor (P(Description | Humanities Professor)) 

Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, he fits the profile of a Computer Science professor more than a Humanities professor. Let's assume:
    - P(Description | Computer Science Professor) = 0.9
    - P(Description | Humanities Professor) = 0.1

3. **Posterior probability using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:**

\[ P(\text{Computer Science Professor} | \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's Description} | \text{Computer Science Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science Professor})}{P(\text{Jason's Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Jason's Description}) = P(\text{Jason's Description} | \text{Computer Science Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science Professor}) + P(\text{Jason's Description} | \text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Jason's Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

So:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science Professor} | \text{Jason's Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus the posterior probability is \( 0.75 \).
