To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( B \) as the event that the description matches Jason.

Given:
- There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Prior probabilities:
- \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to make an educated guess regarding \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), based on the description of Jason. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more closely associated with computer science, we might infer that:

- \( P(B|A) \) (probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor) is relatively high.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) is relatively low.

We can assume these probabilities to reflect this relationship:

- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (a high likelihood, since the description aligns with typical CS interests).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (a lower likelihood, since the description does not strongly match typical humanities interests).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.25}{0.80 \cdot 0.25 + 0.20 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20}{0.20 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.57 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.57. 

Therefore, the answer is:
