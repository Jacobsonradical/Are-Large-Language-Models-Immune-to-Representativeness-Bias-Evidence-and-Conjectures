To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The likelihood of randomly selecting a computer science professor \(P(CS)\) is 25 out of 100, or 0.25.
   - The likelihood of randomly selecting a humanities professor \(P(H)\) is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - We need to consider the likelihood of observing Jason's description given a professor is in computer science \(P(description|CS)\).
   - We also need the likelihood of observing Jason's description given a professor is in the humanities \(P(description|H)\).

Given Jason enjoys activities such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science, we assume that it's more likely he is a computer science professor. For the sake of this example, let's assign the probabilities:
   - \(P(description|CS) = 0.9\) (since the description fits well with computer science).
   - \(P(description|H) = 0.1\) (since the description fits less well with humanities).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is calculated as follows:
\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Inserting the probabilities:
\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
\]

\[
P(CS|description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Therefore, the solution in the required format is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
