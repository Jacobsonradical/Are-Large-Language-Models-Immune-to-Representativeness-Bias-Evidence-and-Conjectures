To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS)):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(H)):** The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(desc | CS)):** The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. The description aligns well with typical traits associated with computer science (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles), so we can estimate this to be relatively high. Let’s conservatively estimate this likelihood as 0.8.

4. **Likelihood (P(desc | H)):** The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. The traits described, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, seem less typical of humanities professors, so we can estimate this likelihood to be relatively low. Let’s conservatively estimate this likelihood as 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability (P(CS|desc)):

\[
P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(desc | CS) \times P(CS) + P(desc | H) \times P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
Numerator = 0.8 \times 0.25 = 0.2
\]
\[
Denominator = 0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

\[
P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.5714
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.5714.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.5714"}}
\]
