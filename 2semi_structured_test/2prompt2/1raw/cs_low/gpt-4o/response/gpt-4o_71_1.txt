Given the description of Jason and the information about the number of professors in each group, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We also need \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \). This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We have the following base rates:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor),
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor).

Now we need estimates for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the description, Jason seems to have characteristics more typical of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than a humanities professor. Therefore, we can assume:

- \( P(D | C) \) is relatively high, let's say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low, let's say \( 0.2 \).

Now, we can plug these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now calculate \( P(C | D) \):

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.57"}
