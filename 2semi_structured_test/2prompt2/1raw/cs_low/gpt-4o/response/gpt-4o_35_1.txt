To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem takes into account the prior probability and the likelihood of the given evidence.

Firstly, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability (P(CS)) of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability (P(H)) of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods of the description for each group. While the exact probabilities are not given, we can make an educated assessment based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing which are more typical activities of humanities professors.
- Jason is described as highly creative, talented, and ambitious, which can apply to both groups, but specific hobbies are more indicative of a computer science background.

Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, we can assume that these traits are much more common in computer science than in the humanities. For simplicity, and to illustrate the process, let's assume these likelihoods:
- Likelihood of the description given computer science (P(description | CS)) is high, say 0.8.
- Likelihood of the description given humanities (P(description | H)) is significantly lower, say 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) can be found by:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.35 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571, or 57.1%.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
