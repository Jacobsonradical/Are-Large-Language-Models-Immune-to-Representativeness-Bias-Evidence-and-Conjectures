Given the information provided in the problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we estimate \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \):

Jason's description aligns more with common traits observed in computer science professors, such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being creative in activities other than drawing or writing. We assume:
- \( P(D \mid C) \approx 0.9 \): High likelihood that a computer science professor fits this description.
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.1 \): Low likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description.

Now we can compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
