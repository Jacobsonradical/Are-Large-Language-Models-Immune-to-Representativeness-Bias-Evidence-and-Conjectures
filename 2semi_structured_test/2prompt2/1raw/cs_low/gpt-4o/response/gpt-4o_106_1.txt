To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we have the description of Jason.

First, let's denote the probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Hum}) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{Desc}) \): Overall probability of Jason's description.

Given the number of professors in each group:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \). Given the provided description, characteristics like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing suggest that it is more likely for Jason to be a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. So let's reasonably assume:
\[ P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \] (high likelihood given the description fits the profile of a computer science professor)
\[ P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) = 0.2 \] (low likelihood given the description doesn't fit as well)

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{Desc}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
