To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Define the groups:**
   - \( C \): Professors in computer science (25 professors)
   - \( H \): Professors in the humanities (75 professors)

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihood (probability of the description given the group):**
   - We need to evaluate the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description fits stereotypical traits often associated with computer science (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles) more closely than those traditionally associated with the humanities.

   For simplicity, let us assume:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = 0.9 \) (High likelihood considering the traits)
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.1 \) (Low likelihood considering the traits)

4. **Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[
   P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
