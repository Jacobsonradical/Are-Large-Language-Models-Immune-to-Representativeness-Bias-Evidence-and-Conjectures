To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem.

We'll denote:
- \( C \) as the event that he is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that he is a humanities professor.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): the prior probability of being a computer science professor (which is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \)).
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability of being a humanities professor (which is \( 75/100 = 0.75 \)).
- \( P(D|C) \): the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \( D \): the description of Jason.

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more characteristic of a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor. Even without exact numerical values for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can intuitively assess that \( P(D|C) > P(D|H) \). 

In this situation, we'll assume that:
- \( P(D|C) \) (the likelihood for a computer science professor) is relatively high, say 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \) (the likelihood for a humanities professor) is relatively low, say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be derived as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \times P(C) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

So,
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Thus,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
