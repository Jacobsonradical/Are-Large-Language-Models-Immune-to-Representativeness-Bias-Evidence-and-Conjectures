To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem relates the conditional probability and the marginal probability of events in a given distribution or dataset.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the observed description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). These are the probabilities of someone matching Jason's description given that they are a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

The description of Jason includes attributes such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing, which are more likely to be characteristics of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without precise probabilities for these, we have to make reasonable assumptions based on common stereotypes.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.8 \) (Jason's description is very typical for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (Jason's description is not typical for a humanities professor)

Now, Bayes' theorem needs the total probability \( P(D) \), which can be calculated as:

\[
P(D) = P(D | C) \times P(C) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
\]

So,

\[
P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
\]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.275} \approx \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.727.

\[
{"probability": "0.727"}
\]
