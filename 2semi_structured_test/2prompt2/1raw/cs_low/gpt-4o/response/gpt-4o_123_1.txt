To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason's description.

First, letâ€™s determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, let's consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \):
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more common among computer science professors. Hence, we infer that the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor is relatively high.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be less common among humanities professors. Hence, we infer that the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor is relatively low.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.8 \) (high, but not absolute)
- \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \approx 0.2 \) (low, but not impossible)

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}})}
= \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{(0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)} 
= \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
= \frac{0.2}{0.35} 
\approx 0.571 
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.571"} \]
