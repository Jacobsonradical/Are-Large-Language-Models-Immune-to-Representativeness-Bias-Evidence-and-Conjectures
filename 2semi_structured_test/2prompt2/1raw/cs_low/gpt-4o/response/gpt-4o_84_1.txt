Given the nature of Jason's description, we can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is based on the initial proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is the complement of the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

   \[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   The likelihood that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and is described as conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, and highly creative, given that he is a computer science professor, is assumed to be relatively high. For example, let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \).

   The likelihood that a humanities professor has the same attributes is assumed to be lower due to the nature of the disciplines and the description provided. For example, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \).

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The total probability of the description is the weighted sum of the likelihoods.

   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \\
   P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \\
   P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**:
   Applying Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \\
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \\
   P(A|B) = 0.75
   \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
