To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

First, we need to estimate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Hence, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Hence, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   - Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more stereotypically aligned with computer science.
   - Let's suppose the probability of such a description if Jason is a computer science professor is high, e.g., 0.9.

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|H) \):**
   - The same interests are less aligned with the typical humanities professor.
   - Let's assume a lower probability, e.g., 0.1.

5. \( P(B) \) is computed as follows:
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
