To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the process:

We have:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

Now, we also need to estimate:
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D | Hum) \): Probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor

Given the description, it seems more aligned with the typical traits associated with computer science professors (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, not so much with humanities-related activities). So let's assign some probabilities as follows (since exact values are not given, we will assign based on reasonable assumptions):

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.2 \)

With Bayes' theorem, we can compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.

The answer is:
