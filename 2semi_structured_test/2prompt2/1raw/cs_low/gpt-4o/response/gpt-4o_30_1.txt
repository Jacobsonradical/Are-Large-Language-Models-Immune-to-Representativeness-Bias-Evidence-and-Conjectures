To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 tenured computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured humanities professors.
- This makes a total of 100 professors.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

From the problem, we have:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To find \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) (where \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor), we need to consider how likely the description is for each type of professor. The description includes aspects that may be more common among computer science professors, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, versus humanities professors.

For the sake of this calculation, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the description aligns well with common traits for CS professors)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given the description does not align well with traits commonly observed in humanities professors)

The total probability of the description \( P(D) \) is given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
Where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.571 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

Thus, the answer should be in the format:
{"probability": "0.571"}
