In order to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description.

First, we calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

So, \( P(A) = 0.25 \).

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(A') \), is:

\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let’s consider the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \). These represent how likely Jason’s description is given his profession.

Given the description includes interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles (traits more commonly associated with computer science), let's assume: 
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (since these traits are highly indicative of a computer science professor).
- \( P(B|A') = 0.1 \) (since these traits are less indicative of a humanities professor).

Now, we calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.225) + (0.075) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
