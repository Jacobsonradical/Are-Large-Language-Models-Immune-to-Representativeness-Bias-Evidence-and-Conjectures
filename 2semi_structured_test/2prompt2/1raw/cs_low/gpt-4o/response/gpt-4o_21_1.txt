Given the description of Jason, we need to update our belief about the likelihood that he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Initially, the base rates for the two groups are as follows:

- Probability Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, based on the description, we see that:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of a computer science professor.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with the humanities.

Although there is not enough information to perform a formal Bayesian update with likelihoods, the specific interests in coding and mathematical puzzles (which are more characteristic of computer science professors) increase our confidence that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor compared to the overall base rates.

Using this qualitative information, we update our posterior probability. Because the description heavily aligns with traits typical of computer science professors, we significantly raise our estimate above the base rate.

A reasonable posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor, given the description, could be:

{"probability": "0.85"}
