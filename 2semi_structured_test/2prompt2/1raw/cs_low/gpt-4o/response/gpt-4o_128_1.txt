To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we should apply Bayes' theorem. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor from the sample: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor from the sample: \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(Description | CS) \).
   - Probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Description | Humanities) \).

Considering that Jason enjoys "coding, solving mathematical puzzles", which are more closely associated with computer science, intuitively, \( P(Description | CS) \) is likely higher than \( P(Description | Humanities) \).

For the sake of this problem, let's assume:
   - \( P(Description | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood given his traits)
   - \( P(Description | Humanities) \approx 0.1 \) (lower likelihood given his traits)

3. **Marginal Likelihood:**
   - The total probability of the description regardless of the discipline, \( P(Description) \):
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | Description) \):
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
