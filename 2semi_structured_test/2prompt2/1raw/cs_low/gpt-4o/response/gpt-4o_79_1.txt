Based on the provided description, we need to update the prior probability using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of the description.

We start with the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more commonly associated with computer science professors. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that:
\[ P(D | CS) \] is likely to be higher than \( P(D | H) \).

Without exact values, we can assume:
\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \] 
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.2 \]

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \), we have:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.20 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

So, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.571"}
