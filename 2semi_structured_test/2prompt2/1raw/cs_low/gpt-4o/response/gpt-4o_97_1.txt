To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS) in the sample, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem in this context is:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

### Given:
- Total professors in the sample: 100 (25 CS + 75 Humanities)
- Prior probability \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \): The probability of the description if Jason is a Humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and traits, it is reasonable to assume the following:
- It's more likely for a computer science professor to enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
- Compared to a humanities professor, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to the description matching a CS professor.

Let's assume these subjective estimates:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
