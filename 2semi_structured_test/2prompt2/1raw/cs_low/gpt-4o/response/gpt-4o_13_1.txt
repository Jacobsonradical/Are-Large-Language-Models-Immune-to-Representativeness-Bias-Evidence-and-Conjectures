To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description fits Jason.

We are interested in \(P(C|D)\).

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to evaluate the likelihoods:
- \(P(D|C)\): The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interests (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) and his traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, and creative but not liking drawing or writing), it seems more typical for a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
