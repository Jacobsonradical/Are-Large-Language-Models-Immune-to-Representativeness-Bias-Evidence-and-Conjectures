To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) or the humanities (H) field. Based on the study, we know there are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the description of Jason given that he is a computer science professor, \(P(D | CS)\), and the probability of the description given that he is a humanities professor, \(P(D | H)\). Based on the given description, someone who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles seems more likely to be a computer science professor. However, since exact probabilities are not given, let's assume:
   \[
   P(D | CS) = 0.8
   \]
   \[
   P(D | H) = 0.2
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) \approx 0.571
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.571"}}}
