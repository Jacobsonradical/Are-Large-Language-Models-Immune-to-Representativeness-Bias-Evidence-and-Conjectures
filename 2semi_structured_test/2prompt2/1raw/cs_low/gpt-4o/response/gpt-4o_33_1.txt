To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities (\(P(\text{H})\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science (\(P(D|\text{CS})\))
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is in the humanities (\(P(D|\text{H})\))

   Since the description includes traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors than humanities professors, we might reasonably assume:
   - \(P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.9\) (high likelihood for a CS professor)
   - \(P(D|\text{H}) = 0.1\) (low likelihood for a Humanities professor)

3. **Normalization Factor (Total Probability of Description):**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H})P(\text{H})
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem):**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS})P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Given these calculations, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
