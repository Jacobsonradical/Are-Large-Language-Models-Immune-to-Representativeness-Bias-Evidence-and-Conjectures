To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence or description given about Jason.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description occurring.

**Prior probabilities:**
- \( P(A) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

**Likelihood:**
- \( P(B|A) \): Since Jason's description aligns well with typical traits of a computer science professor (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not drawing or writing), let's assume this is very high. For simplicity, we can assign this a high hypothetical value, such as 0.9.
  
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Since Jason's description is less typical for a humanities professor (more aligned with computer science interests), let's assign this a lower hypothetical value, such as 0.1.

**Total probability of the description (B):**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

**Posterior Probability:**
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
