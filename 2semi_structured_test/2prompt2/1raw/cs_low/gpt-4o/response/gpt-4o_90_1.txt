Based on the description of Jason, he seems to have interests and personality traits that align more closely with those of a computer science professor. Interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging suggest a higher likelihood of him being in the computer science field rather than the humanities.

Let's calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem. We'll weigh the base rates, which are the initial probabilities given by the proportions of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample:

- Number of computer science professors, \( P(CS) \): 25
- Number of humanities professors, \( P(H) \): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The base rate probability of being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate probability of being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given Jason's profile and the Bayesian update, we would estimate that the description fits a computer science professor more due to stated interests and traits. For simplicity, let's assign a high likelihood ratio to reflect the fact that such traits are far more common in computer science compared to humanities.

Assuming a very high likelihood that the description fits with a computer science professor (e.g., 0.9) and a much lower likelihood that it fits with a humanities professor (e.g., 0.1), we can perform a simplified Bayesian update:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]
Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the high and low likelihoods, we get:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \]

The posterior probability is then:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
