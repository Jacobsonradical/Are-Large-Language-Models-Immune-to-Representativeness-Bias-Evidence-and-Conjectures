Given the description of Jason, we need to determine the posterior probability that he is one of the computer science professors rather than one from the humanities. We begin with the prior probabilities and use Bayesian reasoning to update with the given evidence.

Firstly, the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods of this description for each group. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly indicative of a computer science professor. He does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that are generally more closely associated with humanities professors. These characteristics make it more likely that he is from the computer science group.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the probability that a computer science professor would fit Jason’s description.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the probability that a humanities professor would fit Jason’s description.

Although we don't have exact figures, it's reasonable to assume that:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is relatively lower because of the less alignment with typical activities and interests in the humanities.

Given the generally higher likelihood of such a description fitting a computer science professor, we might estimate the following:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.8 \) (fairly strong likelihood)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood)

Using Bayes' Theorem to update the probabilities:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
