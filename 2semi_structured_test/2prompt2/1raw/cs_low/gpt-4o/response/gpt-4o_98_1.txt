Given the description of Jason and the setup of the study, we have the following key points to consider:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Before considering Jason's description, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now let's consider the description of Jason:

- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing.

These interests and disinterests align more closely with typical characteristics associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors.

To update the prior probability with this new information, we need to consider how likely it is for a computer science professor versus a humanities professor to match this description.

Let's assume the probability of a computer science professor having interests and characteristics similar to Jason is higher than that of a humanities professor. In the absence of specific numerical data for these probabilities, we make a reasonable assumption based on typical stereotypes and characteristics:

- Let \( P(D|CS) \) represent the probability of a computer science professor having Jason's description.
- Let \( P(D|H) \) represent the probability of a humanities professor having Jason's description.

Typically, \( P(D|CS) \) is much higher than \( P(D|H) \) because computer science professors are more likely to enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles, and less likely to enjoy drawing or writing.

Using Bayesian inference, we update our prior probability \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) with the likelihoods:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given that \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \),

If we assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (because Jason's description strongly matches the characteristics of a CS professor),
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (because Jason's description weakly matches the characteristics of a humanities professor),

We calculate:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
