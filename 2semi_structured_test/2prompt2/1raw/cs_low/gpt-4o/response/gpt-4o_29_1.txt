To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - The probability of randomly picking a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \):
     \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability of randomly picking a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \):
     \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  
2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \).
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \).

   Based on the description, Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) seem more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. For simplicity's sake, let's assign:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \times P(\text{H})
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

   Now, calculating the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
