To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of observing the description.

First, we set up the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging while being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing sounds more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D \mid CS) ≈ 0.8 \] (high likelihood for a CS professor)
\[ P(D \mid H) ≈ 0.2 \] (low likelihood for a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} ≈ 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.

Answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
