To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is used to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on new evidence.

First, let's outline the key information for our calculations:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H))\): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Likelihoods:
   - Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))

We'll need to estimate these likelihoods based on the traits described:

- **Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles**: This strongly suggests a computer science background.
- **Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing**: This is less common in humanities professions.
- **Jason is creative but conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious**: These traits could apply to both fields, so they don't heavily sway the likelihood.

Given these observations, we can assume the likelihood \(P(D|CS)\) to be significantly higher than \(P(D|H)\). 

For simplicity and to keep it straightforward, let's assign:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\) (very likely traits for a computer science professor)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\) (unlikely traits for a humanities professor)

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(P(D)\) (the total probability of the description) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
