To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. The theorem integrates prior probabilities with conditional probabilities to update the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Given that:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability, \(P(CS)\), that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- Similarly, the prior probability, \(P(H)\), that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Let \(E\) denote the event corresponding to Jason's description.

We need the posterior probability \(P(CS|E)\), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E|CS)\) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- \(P(E)\) is the marginal probability of the description.

Since \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the description, it can be expressed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Based on the information, characteristics in the description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) suggest a closer alignment with computer science compared to humanities. Therefore, we might assume that \(P(E|CS) > P(E|H)\).

Although we don't have specific numerical values for \(P(E|CS)\) and \(P(E|H)\), we can estimate the probability based on the given context. 

Assume:
- \( P(E|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (Jason's profile strongly aligns with computer science traits)
- \( P(E|H) \approx 0.1 \) (Jason's profile weakly aligns with humanities traits)

Now, we calculate \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Therefore,
