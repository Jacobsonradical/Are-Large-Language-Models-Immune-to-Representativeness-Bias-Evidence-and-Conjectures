To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem. Here's the information we have:

- Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 25/100 = 0.25
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): 75/100 = 0.75

We need to estimate the likelihood of the given description being associated with a computer science professor (P(D|CS)) and a humanities professor (P(D|H)). Based on Jason's characteristics—enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and not enjoying drawing or writing—it seems more consistent with the stereotype of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assign some plausible values:

- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)): We might reasonably estimate this to be quite high, say 0.85.
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (P(D|H)): This seems less likely, so we might estimate this to be lower, say 0.15.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability is calculated as follows:

$$
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H)}
$$

Substituting in the numbers:

$$
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.85 * 0.25}{0.85 * 0.25 + 0.15 * 0.75}
$$

Now let's compute it:

$$
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2125}{0.2125 + 0.1125}
$$
$$
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2125}{0.325}
$$
$$
P(CS|D) \approx 0.6538
$$

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.65.
