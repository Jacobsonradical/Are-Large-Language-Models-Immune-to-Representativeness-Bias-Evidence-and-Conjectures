To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(Description | CS) \)).
   - We also need to estimate the likelihood of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(Description | H) \)).

Given Jason’s interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his creativity, it’s more likely that he would be a computer science professor. Therefore, we can assign higher probability to \( P(Description | CS) \) compared to \( P(Description | H) \).

Assuming reasonable hypothetical values for these likelihoods:
   - Let \( P(Description | CS) = 0.9 \)
   - Let \( P(Description | H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description and can be found as:
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.3 \]

So,
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
