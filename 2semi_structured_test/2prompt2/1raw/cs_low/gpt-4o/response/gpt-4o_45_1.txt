Given the description of Jason and the information about the distribution of professors in the study, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief about whether Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor or a humanities professor. 

First, let’s establish our prior probabilities:
- The probability (prior) that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability (prior) that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Let's denote:
- \( P(Description | CS) \): The probability of the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description | Hum) \): The probability of the description given he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason’s interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and the absence of interest in drawing or writing, it is much more stereotypically aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. While we don’t have exact numerical values for these conditional probabilities, it's reasonable to assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood for a computer science professor)
- \( P(Description | Hum) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood for a humanities professor).

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | Description) \):

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Substitute in the values:

\[
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \approx 0.75
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
