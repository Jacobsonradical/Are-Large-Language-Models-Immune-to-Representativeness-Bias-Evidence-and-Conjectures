To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science discipline: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability (prior) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities discipline: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's described traits being associated with a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which might be more common among computer science professors. His dislike of drawing or writing and enjoyment of jogging are less definitive but can still be considered.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   - Bayesian update requires calculating the likelihood of Jason's traits given he is from computer science and given he is from humanities.

Let \( P(CS | Jason) \) be the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, and \( P(H | Jason) \) be the probability that he is a humanities professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Assuming:
- The likelihood of Jason's traits for the computer science professors \( P(Jason | CS) \) is relatively high, let's say approximately 0.9.
- The likelihood of Jason's traits for the humanities professors \( P(Jason | H) \) is lower, let's say approximately 0.1.

Putting the numbers into the formula:
\[
P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

Simplify the denominator:
\[
P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.75.
