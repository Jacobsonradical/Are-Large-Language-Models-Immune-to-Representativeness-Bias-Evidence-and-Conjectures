To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the event of getting the description provided.

First, we need the prior probability \( P(A) \) which is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(\neg A) \) which is the probability that the professor is from the humanities:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need the likelihood \( P(B|A) \), which is the probability of getting this description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given the description (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Let's assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high.

Similarly, we need \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of getting this description given that Jason is from the humanities. Given the description, this probability seems relatively low compared to computer science professors. Let's assign some indicative values:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability of getting the description, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
