To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given:
- We have 25 computer science professors (CS).
- We have 75 humanities professors (H).

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assume \( P(B|CS) \) (likelihood of the description for a CS professor) is higher because Jason's interests and traits (such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are more aligned with computer science. Let's conservatively estimate \( P(B|CS) \) as 0.8 and \( P(B|H) \) (likelihood of the description for a humanities professor) as 0.2.

Now, we can calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{H})P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.25) + (0.2)(0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS})P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.25)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.5714 \).

Here's the final answer:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
