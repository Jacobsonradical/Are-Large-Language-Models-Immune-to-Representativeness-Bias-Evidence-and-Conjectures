To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should consider both the prior probabilities and how well the description fits each group. 

1. **Prior probability (Base rate):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood (Fit to Description):**
   - The description includes elements that seem more typical of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.), but we have no concrete data on the distribution of these traits within each group. We do know both groups were described based on personality tests and interviews.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
   - To adjust for how well the description fits each group, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

   Since we are asked only for a rough estimate and must make assumptions about the likelihoods (due to insufficient data), let's assume:
   - Jason's traits are moderately more common among computer science professors, let's say \( P(D|CS) = 0.7 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.3 \).

Given this, we can simplify the equation due to the qualitative nature of the data:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.7 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.225} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.175}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4375 \]

So, the posterior probability is approximately 0.44 (rounded).

However, without precise data on \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), this is an estimation. Based on the qualitative assumptions and given description, the posterior probability is:
