To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the 25 computer science professors, given the description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The probability can be found using the formula:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we know:
- \( P(CS) \) (the probability of picking a computer science professor) is \( 25/100 \) or \( 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) (the probability of picking a humanities professor) is \( 75/100 \) or \( 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \):

From the description, Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) and disinterest in drawing or writing strongly suggest traits more typical of a computer science professor. Hence, assuming:
- \( P(D | CS) \), the probability that a computer science professor has this description, is relatively high.
- \( P(D | H) \), the probability that a humanities professor has this description, is relatively low.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \)

Now calculate the total probability \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
