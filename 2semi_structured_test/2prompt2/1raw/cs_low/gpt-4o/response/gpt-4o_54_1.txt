To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor (CS) out of the total sample is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor (H) out of the total sample is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Based on the description, Jason seems to have traits that are more aligned with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than a humanities professor. Let's denote the description of traits as \( D \).

   While we don't have exact probabilities, it can be reasonable to assume that the likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits, \( P(D|CS) \), is substantially higher than that of a humanities professor having these traits, \( P(D|H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - And similarly:
     \[
     P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
     \]

   Since we are only interested in the relative probabilities, we can use the odds form of Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     \text{Odds}(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
     \]

   Since \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \), let's assume a reasonable relative likelihood:
     \[
     P(D|CS) = 0.9 \quad \text{(high likelihood Jason is a CS professor)}
     \]
     \[
     P(D|H) = 0.1 \quad \text{(low likelihood Jason is a Humanities professor)}
     \]

   Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Odds}(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.075} = 3
     \]

   Converting to probability:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{\text{Odds}(CS|D)}{1 + \text{Odds}(CS|D)} = \frac{3}{1 + 3} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
     \]

Based on these assumptions and the data given, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
