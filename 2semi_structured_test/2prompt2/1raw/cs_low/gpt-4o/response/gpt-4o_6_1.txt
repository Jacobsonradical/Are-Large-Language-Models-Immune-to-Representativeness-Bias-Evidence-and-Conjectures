To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \).

Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science. Let's assume that these traits make him much more likely to be a computer science professor.

While exact numerical likelihoods can be challenging to pinpoint without more data, we can make a reasoned estimate based on the given information.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
