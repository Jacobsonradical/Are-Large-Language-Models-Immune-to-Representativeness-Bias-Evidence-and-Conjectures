To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define each component:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
   So, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability, \( P(A^c) \)**:
   The probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(A^c) \)) is:
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood of Description Given Computer Science, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   Jason's interests such as coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors. Assuming a higher probability consistent with these traits, we can estimate \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \).

4. **Likelihood of Description Given Humanities, \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
   Humanities professors are less likely to match Jason's profile, which leans heavily towards activities more common in computer science. Assuming a lower probability, we can estimate \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \).

5. **Overall Probability of the Description, \( P(B) \)**:
   \( P(B) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)
   \]
   Substituting in the values, we get:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

So, using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
