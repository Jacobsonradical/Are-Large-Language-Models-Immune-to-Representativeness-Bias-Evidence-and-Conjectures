{"probability": "0.75"}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning: Initially, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (prior probability) is 25% because 25 out of the 100 professors are from computer science. However, after reading the description, there are several details that suggest Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor: his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in writing. These traits are more stereotypically associated with computer science professors than with humanities professors.

To adjust the prior probability, we consider how much more likely these traits are to apply to a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Assuming the traits are significantly more common among computer science professors, the posterior probability would increase.

Using Bayes' theorem in a simplified intuitive way, if the likelihood of having these traits is much higher for computer science professors than for humanities professors, the posterior probability can be estimated to be around 0.75.
