To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming the description \( D \) fits a computer science professor more than a humanities professor due to specific interests mentioned (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), let's consider that:

- \( P(D | CS) \) is higher than \( P(D | H) \).

However, without specific numerical values, we still need to make an educated guess based on the description. Given Jason's interests align more with those typical of a computer science professor, we can estimate:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \).
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \).

Now, calculate:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
