To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to determine the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. 

Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason fits the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's the breakdown of the terms:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor.

3. \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a humanities professor.

5. \( P(B) \): The total probability that Jason fits the description.

For the purposes of this problem, estimating the values of \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) may require assumptions based on typical characteristics associated with computer science professors versus humanities professors.

Given the description, it seems likely that someone who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more likely to be a computer science professor. Let's assume the following:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (80% chance that a computer science professor fits the description)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.2 \) (20% chance that a humanities professor fits the description)

Now, we can compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
       = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
       = 0.2 + 0.15
       = 0.35
\]

Finally, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
        = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
        = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
        = \frac{2}{3}
        \approx 0.571
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.571.

\[
{"probability": "0.571"}
\]
