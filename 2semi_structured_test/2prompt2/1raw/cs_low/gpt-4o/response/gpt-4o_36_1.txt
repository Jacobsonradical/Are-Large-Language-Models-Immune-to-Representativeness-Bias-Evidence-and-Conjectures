Given the description, Jason's interests and traits provide strong clues regarding which group he might belong to. Here's a reasoned approach:

1. **Base Rate Information**: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making it more likely for any randomly chosen description to belong to a humanities professor.

2. **Personality and Interests**: Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging strongly align with activities associated with computer science rather than the humanities. His dislike for drawing or writing further supports this alignment.

Let's apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \):

- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = Probability that a professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) \) = Probability that a professor is from humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) = Likelihood of the description given the professor is from computer science. Given Jason's interests align strongly with CS, let's assume this probability to be high, say 0.9.
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \) = Likelihood of the description given the professor is from humanities. Given the interests do not align well with humanities, let's assume this probability to be low, say 0.1.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, we can find \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
