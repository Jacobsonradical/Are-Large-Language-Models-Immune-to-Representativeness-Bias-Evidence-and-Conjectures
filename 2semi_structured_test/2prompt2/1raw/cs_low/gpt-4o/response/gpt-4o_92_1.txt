To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes’ theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given for Jason.

We need to find each component of Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science (CS) professor.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability, \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor. Given the description (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it seems more characteristic of a CS professor.

   While we don't have specific likelihood values from the study, we can infer that it's highly likely a CS professor would match this description. Let’s assume:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. This is less likely because the description matches a CS professor’s traits more closely.

   Let’s assume:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]
   
5. **Marginal likelihood, \( P(B) \)**:
   This is the total probability of the description occurring:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
