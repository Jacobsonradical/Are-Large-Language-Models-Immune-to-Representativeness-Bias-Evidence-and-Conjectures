To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The general form of Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- 25 out of 100 professors are in computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \)).
- 75 out of 100 professors are in the humanities (\( P(\text{H}) = 0.75 \)).

Assuming the likelihood \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D \mid \text{H}) \) can be inferred from Jason's interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, and considering typical traits associated with each field:

Let's assume \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) = 0.9 \), because coding and solving mathematical puzzles are highly characteristic of computer science professors, and \( P(D \mid \text{H}) = 0.1 \), as these activities are less characteristic of humanities professors.

Now let's calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, based on the given information, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
