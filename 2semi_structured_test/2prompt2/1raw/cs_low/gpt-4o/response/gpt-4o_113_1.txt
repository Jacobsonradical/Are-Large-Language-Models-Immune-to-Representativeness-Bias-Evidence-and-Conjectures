To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.

Based on the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, and not drawing or writing, it's more likely these are traits of a computer science professor.
- We'll assume \( P(D|CS) \) to be relatively high, and \( P(D|H) \) to be relatively low.

For estimation purposes, let's assign:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
