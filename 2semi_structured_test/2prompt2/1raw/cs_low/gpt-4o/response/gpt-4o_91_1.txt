To solve this, we should use Bayes' Theorem, which can help us update our initial probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( CS \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) = Description given.

1. **Prior probabilities** (initial likelihood based on the proportions in the sample):
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor)

2. **Likelihood** (how probable the description is given each hypothesis):
   Let's assume that the description of Jason fits computer science professors more than humanities professors, given his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. To quantify this, let's assign:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor)
   - \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor)

3. **Posterior probability** (using Bayes' Theorem):
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | D) = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
