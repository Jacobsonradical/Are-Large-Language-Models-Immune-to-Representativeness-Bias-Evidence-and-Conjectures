To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 100.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor".
- \( B \) is the event "Jason's description matches".

First, let's determine our prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25.
- \( P(A') \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75.

Next, we need to consider the likelihood:
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jasonâ€™s description (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it appears more consistent with someone in computer science. Thus, while exact likelihood values are not provided, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is significantly higher than \( P(B|A') \).

For conservative estimation, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \)

Now we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
