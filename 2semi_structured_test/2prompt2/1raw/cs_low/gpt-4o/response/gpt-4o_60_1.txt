To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we generally set it up:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason has the given description.
  
We're looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we'll define the terms:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, \( P(A) \) is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason has the given description if he is a computer science professor. We'll assume the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) is higher for computer science professors due to Jason's interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. 

- Let \( P(\neg A) \) be the probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason has the given description if he is a humanities professor. Given Jason's interests, this probability is likely lower for humanities professors.
  
Because the detailed probability values are not provided, we'll assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (a reasonably high assumption for a fit)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (a reasonably low assumption for a mismatch)

Next, we can calculate \( P(B) \), the marginal likelihood, which includes both scenarios:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \]

So:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:
