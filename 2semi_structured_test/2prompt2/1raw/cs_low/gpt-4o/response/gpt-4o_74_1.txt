To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the study is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the study is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid C) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Using the provided data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(C) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

To solve this, we need estimates for \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Intuitively, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science professors than humanities professors.

Assuming:
- \( P(D \mid C) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor).
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor).

We substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now we calculate \( P(C \mid D) \):

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.75 \).

The answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
