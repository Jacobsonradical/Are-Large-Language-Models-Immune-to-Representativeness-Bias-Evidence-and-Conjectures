To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (`P(CS)`): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (`P(H)`): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (`P(D|CS)`).
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (`P(D|H)`).

Based on the description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"), it seems more aligned with typical traits often associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

We need to assign reasonable estimates to these likelihoods given the information:
- Let's assume `P(D|CS)` might be low, reflecting it is less likely for a computer science professor to have these traits.
- Let's assume `P(D|H)` might be high, reflecting it is more likely for a humanities professor to have these traits.

For simplicity, let's estimate:
- `P(D|CS) ≈ 0.2`
- `P(D|H) ≈ 0.8`

3. **Posterior Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem**:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} ≈ 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:
