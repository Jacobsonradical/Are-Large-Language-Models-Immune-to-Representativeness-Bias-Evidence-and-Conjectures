Given the information provided, we start by calculating the prior probabilities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so:

- Prior probability for a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability for a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we try to determine the likelihood of the description given the category (computer science or humanities). Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, and not particularly technical. These traits generally align more closely with humanities professors than computer science professors:

- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \): Likelihood of a computer science professor having this description.
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \): Likelihood of a humanities professor having this description.

Intuitively, let's assume these likelihoods based on the typical traits of these professions:
- Suppose \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- Suppose \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) = 0.8 \)

We use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{CS|Description}) \):

\[
P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description|CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

\( P(\text{Description}) \) can be found as:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description|CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description|Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum})
\]

Inserting the values:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now:
\[
P(\text{CS|Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{"probability": "0.4286"\}
