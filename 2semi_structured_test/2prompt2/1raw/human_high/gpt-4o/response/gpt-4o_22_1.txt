To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \(A\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \(B\) be the event that Jason matches the given description.

Given:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\neg A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

\(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)  (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total)
\(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)  (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that a computer science professor matches the description.
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) is the probability that a humanities professor matches the description.

Without detailed specific data, a qualitative assessment suggests that humanities professors are more likely to be described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical compared to computer science professors. So, \(P(B|\neg A) > P(B|A)\).

For the sake of this example, let's assume:
- \(P(B|A) = 0.1\) (as being emotionally driven and not particularly technical is less common among computer science professors)
- \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.6\) (as being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical fits more with a humanities professor's description)

Bayes' theorem states:

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

We calculate \(P(B)\) as:

\[P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)\]

\[P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.6 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 + 0.15 = 0.225\]

Now we can find \(P(A|B)\):

\[P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.333\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.333.

Therefore,

{"probability": "0.333"}
