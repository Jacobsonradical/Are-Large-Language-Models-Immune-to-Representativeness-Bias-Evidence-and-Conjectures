To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The given description of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\) using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|C)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): Total probability of the description.

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We simplify by acknowledging that total probability \(P(D)\) is:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description, we need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\):

- \(P(D|C)\): Probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Based on the description indicating creativity, imagination, emotional drive, reading, exploration, and a lack of technical focus, it seems more likely to match a humanities professor description than a computer science professor.

Let's make some reasonable estimates:
- \(P(D|C) \approx 0.2\) (less likely based on the description characteristics)
- \(P(D|H) \approx 0.8\) (more likely based on the description characteristics)

Now, substituting these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]

Calculating:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286. 

Expressed in the desired format:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
