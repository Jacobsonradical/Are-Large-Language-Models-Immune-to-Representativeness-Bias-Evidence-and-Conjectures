To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

We want to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Given data:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.

We need to determine:
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

Since descriptions are anecdotal and we don't have exact probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we need to rely on heuristic judgment based on the content of the description. Jason is described as imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate but not particularly technical. These traits seem more commonly associated with the humanities rather than computer science, where technical skills are a primary focus.

For heuristic purposes, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (low probability since Jason is described as not particularly technical)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (high probability given the described traits)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
