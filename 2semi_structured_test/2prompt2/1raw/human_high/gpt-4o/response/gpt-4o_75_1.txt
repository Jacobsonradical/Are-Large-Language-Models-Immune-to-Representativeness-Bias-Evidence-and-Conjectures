To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of Jason's description irrespective of his field.

Let's denote:
- \(A_{\text{CS}}\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(A_{\text{Hum}}\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(B\) as the event describing Jason's personality.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \(P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Without knowing the exact likelihoods, \(P(B|A_{\text{CS}})\) and \(P(B|A_{\text{Hum}})\), we will assume that based on the description provided, Jason's personality traits are more indicative of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

For simplicity, let's estimate:
- \(P(B|A_{\text{CS}})\) as low, say 0.2 (assuming these traits are less common among computer science professors).
- \(P(B|A_{\text{Hum}})\) as high, say 0.8 (assuming these traits are more common among humanities professors).

Now we need to filter P(B):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
