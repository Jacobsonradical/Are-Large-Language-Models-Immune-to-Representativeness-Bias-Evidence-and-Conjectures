To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(Hum)) is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we assess the likelihood of Jason's described traits given each category. Jason's description indicates that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits appear to be more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the likelihoods:
- P(description | CS): The likelihood of Jason's traits given he is a computer science professor. This is likely to be relatively low.
- P(description | Hum): The likelihood of Jason's traits given he is a humanities professor. This is likely to be relatively high.

Without specific numerical values for these likelihoods, we have to make an informed judgement based on typical personality traits common in each field.

Since Jason’s traits are much more indicative of a humanities professor, let’s assign:
- P(description | CS) = 0.1 (indicative of low likelihood)
- P(description | Hum) = 0.8 (indicative of high likelihood)

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where:
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(description) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275 \]

Now the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.273 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.273.

Answer: {"probability": "0.273"}
