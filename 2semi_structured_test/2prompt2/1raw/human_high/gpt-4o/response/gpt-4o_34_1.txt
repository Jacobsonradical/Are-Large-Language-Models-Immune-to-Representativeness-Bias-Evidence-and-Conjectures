To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. In general terms, Bayes' Theorem can be formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of having Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor from the sample.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description among the entire sample.

First, let's establish the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(A) \)):
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Complement Prior Probability** (\( P(\neg A) \)):
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

3. **Likelihood of Description Given Computer Science Professor** (\( P(B|A) \)):
   - Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical." These traits might be seen as less common among computer science professors since this field tends to attract individuals with technical skills.
   - We will assign a hypothetical but reasonable low likelihood for this description, say 0.1.

4. **Likelihood of Description Given Humanities Professor** (\( P(B|\neg A) \)):
   - Humanities fields often attract creative and imaginative individuals, emotionally driven, who enjoy traveling, reading, and exploring.
   - We will assign a hypothetical but reasonable higher likelihood for this description, say 0.7.

Finally, we calculate the overall probability of the description (\( P(B) \)):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
