To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description being given, assuming Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description fits Jason.

We need to estimate the probabilities.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the 100 is from the computer science group.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is not from the computer science group (i.e., from the humanities group).
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor. Given that Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," these traits seem more typical of humanities professors. We can estimate a lower likelihood of this description fitting a computer science professor. Let's assume:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \] (since technical skills are less emphasized, it seems less likely).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: The probability of the description fitting a humanities professor. This description fits our stereotypical view of a humanities professor better, so it is more likely:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \]

5. **Overall probability \( P(B) \)**: This can be derived using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.42857 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.42857.

Here is the answer in the required format:
