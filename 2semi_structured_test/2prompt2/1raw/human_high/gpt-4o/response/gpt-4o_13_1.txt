In order to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason's description.

Here’s how we can apply Bayes's theorem to this problem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
   \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   **Let's denote the likelihood \(P(B|\text{CS})\) and \(P(B|\text{Humanities})\).**
  
   Based on the description, Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical." These traits seem more common and representative of someone in the humanities than in computer science. Hence, we might assume:
   \[ P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \]

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \):**
   The total probability of Jason’s description, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
   \[ P(\text{CS}|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
