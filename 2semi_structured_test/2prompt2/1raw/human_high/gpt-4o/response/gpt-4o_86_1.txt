Given the scenario, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description regardless of his field.

Firstly, we need to calculate the priors:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To determine the posterior probability, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason fitting the given description for each field \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \). Given that Jason's profile includes non-technical traits typically associated with humanities professors, we can assume:

- \( P(B|A) \): Likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's description is relatively low. We might assign this a value like 0.1 (10%).
- \( P(B|H) \): Likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason's description is relatively high. We might assign this a value like 0.7 (70%).

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is:
{"probability": "0.3"}
