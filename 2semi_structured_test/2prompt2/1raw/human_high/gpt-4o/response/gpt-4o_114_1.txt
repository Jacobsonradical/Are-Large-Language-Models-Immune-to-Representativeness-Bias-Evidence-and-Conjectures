To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   - This is the probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor. Given the description as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, and not particularly technical, this seems less likely for a computer science professor.
   - Let’s estimate this likelihood with a more intuitive basis. Suppose it's somewhat lower, say \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (this estimation is somewhat subjective but based on typical stereotypes).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   - This is the likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor.
   - Given that the description matches typical traits more closely associated with the humanities, let’s set this likelihood higher, say \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \).

4. **P(\neg A):**
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
     \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

5. **Marginal Probability \( P(B) \):**
   - This is the total probability of the description given any professor in the sample.
   - Using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
     \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
     \[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   - Now we can compute the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
     \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
