To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) = Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Normalizing constant.

Given the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate:
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \)
- Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \)

Given the description:
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical. These traits may seem to be more aligned with a humanities professor than a technical field like computer science.

Let's assume for simplification:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.3 \) (Some computer scientists might have traits like creativity and exploration, but "not particularly technical" suggests a lower likelihood)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \) (These traits are more aligned with humanities professors)

We must now find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.3)(0.75) + (0.7)(0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.175 = 0.4 \]

Now we apply these values to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.3)(0.75)}{0.4} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.5625 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.5625"}
