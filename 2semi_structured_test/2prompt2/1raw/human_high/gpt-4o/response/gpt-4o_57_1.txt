To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be represented as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( A \)) and 25 humanities professors.
- Prior probabilities: \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The description of Jason suggests he is more emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical, which aligns more with the humanities based on the provided context.

Given the probabilities:
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's traits.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason's traits.

Based on the distribution of traits, it seems more likely that Jason is a humanities professor. Without specific likelihood values, we can estimate that these traits are less common among computer science professors and more common among humanities professors.

For estimation purposes, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \)

Now we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
