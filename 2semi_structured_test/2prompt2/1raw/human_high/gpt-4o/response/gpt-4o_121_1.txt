To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant details:

- Number of computer science professors in the study: 75
- Number of humanities professors in the study: 25
- Total number of professors: 100

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood (the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability (the overall probability of selecting a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood (the overall probability of getting the description).

We need to compare the likelihood of Jason being from computer science (\(P(B|CS)\)) versus that of humanities (\(P(B|H)). The priors \(P(CS)\) and \(P(H)\) are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without specific data about \(P(B|CS)\) and \(P(B|H)\), we can make assumptions based on the description. Jason does not appear very technical, suggesting he is less likely to fit the typical profile of a computer science professor. We will consider a higher likelihood ratio for the humanities professors based on the given description.

Let’s assume:
- The likelihood of the description given a humanities professor \(P(B|H) = 0.8\)
- The likelihood of the description given a computer science professor \(P(B|CS) = 0.2\)

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.4286.
