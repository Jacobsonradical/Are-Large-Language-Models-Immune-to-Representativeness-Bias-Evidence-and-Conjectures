To solve this we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability multiplied by the likelihood of the observed description given the specific class.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:

1. The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor: 
   P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
   P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description being that of a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Based on the given information, Jason's characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) seem more aligned with common stereotypes about humanities professors than computer science professors.

To simplify, let's assume:
- P(Description | CS) = 0.2 (low probability because the description fits less well with a computer science professor)
- P(Description | Hum) = 0.8 (high probability because the description fits well with a humanities professor)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.2 \times 0.75 + 0.8 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Here is your answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
