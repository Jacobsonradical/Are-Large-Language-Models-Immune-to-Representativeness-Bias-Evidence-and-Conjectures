To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description regardless of the category.

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(\text{Hum}) \) = probability that a randomly selected professor is in the humanities = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we estimate \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \):
- Based on the description, it seems more fitting for a humanities professor because Jason is described as not particularly technical and driven by creativity and imagination. For simplicity, let's assume \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \) and \( P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) = 0.9 \).

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{Desc}) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) \):
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Desc}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25, or 25%.
