To solve for the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need the following information:

1. **P(CS)**: Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. **P(Hum)**: Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
3. **P(Desc | CS)**: Probability of Jason's description given that he is from computer science.
4. **P(Desc | Hum)**: Probability of Jason's description given that he is from the humanities.
5. **P(Desc)**: Overall probability of Jason's description.

We are asked for the posterior probability **P(CS | Desc)**: the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   It's challenging to quantify **P(Desc | CS)** and **P(Desc | Hum)** without actual data. However, we are given specific traits and can make some educated guesses:

   Given Jason is described as not particularly technical (which is less common in computer science) and emotionally driven (which might be more common in humanities), we can hypothesize:

   \[
   P(Desc | CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{(a guess indicating lower likelihood)}
   \]

   \[
   P(Desc | Hum) = 0.8 \quad \text{(a guess indicating higher likelihood)}
   \]

3. **Normalizing Constant (Overall Probability of Description):**

   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

### Conclusion:

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the given description, is approximately 0.4286. Therefore, the answer is:
