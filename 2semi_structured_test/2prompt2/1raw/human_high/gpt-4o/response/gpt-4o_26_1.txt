First, let's consider the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making up 100 professors in total. Thus, the prior probabilities are:

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we use the description to update these probabilities. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with common perceptions of humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, we need to estimate the likelihoods of these descriptions:

- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \) (likelihood that a computer science professor would fit this description)
- \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) (likelihood that a humanities professor would fit this description)

It’s reasonable to assume that the description fits better with humanities professors:

- Let's say \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- And \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

Using Bayes’ theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, calculated as:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
