To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided.

First, we need the prior probabilities based on the number of professors in each category:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods, which represent the probability of Jason's description given that he is in each category. Given that Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," this description typically aligns more with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's denote the likelihoods as:
\[ P(D \mid C) \text{ - the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor} \]
\[ P(D \mid H) \text{ - the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor} \]

Since Jason's description aligns more with a humanities professor, we might say:
\[ P(D \mid C) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(D \mid H) = 0.9 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's plug in the values:
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, solve for \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
