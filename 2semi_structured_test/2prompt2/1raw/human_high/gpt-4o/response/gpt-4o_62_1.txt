To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We need to consider two pieces of information:

1. The base rates (priors) for each department.
2. The description of Jason and how likely such a description characterizes a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, let's establish the base rates:
- 75 out of 100 professors are from computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are from the humanities.

The prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the description given the two categories. The description suggests traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, non-technical, and passionate—traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Let’s denote:
- P(D|CS) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- P(D|Hum) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

We can make an educated guess that:
- P(D|CS) might be relatively low, say 0.1 (as non-technical and emotionally driven features are less common among computer science professors).
- P(D|Hum) might be relatively high, say 0.7 (as such traits are more typical among humanities professors).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \).

Thus,

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
