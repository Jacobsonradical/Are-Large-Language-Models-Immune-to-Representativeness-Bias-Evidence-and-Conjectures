{"probability": "0.25"}

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Base rates**: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, so initially, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 75/100 = 0.75, and the probability that he is a humanities professor is 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Description fit**: Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more closely with typical characteristics associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors, who might be more likely to exhibit technical skills.

3. **Posterior probability**: Given the description, the likelihood that Jason is a humanities professor increases relative to the base rate. Combining the prior probabilities with the description using Bayes' theorem generally leads to an adjustment that heavily favors the humanities professor, despite the initial base rate favoring computer science.

Given these considerations, it's reasonable to infer that the posterior probability Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample drops to 0.25.
