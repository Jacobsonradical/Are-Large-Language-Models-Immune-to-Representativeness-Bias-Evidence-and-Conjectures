To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Firstly, let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor,
- \( D \) as the description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We know the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

For \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need estimations for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given Jason's description:
- Creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical.

Typically:
- Computer science professors may be less associated with the description "not particularly technical."
- Humanities professors may align more closely with the traits described.

Let's assign plausible values based on the description:
- \( P(D | CS) \) might be somewhat low, interpreting this as being less likely for a computer science professor. Let's assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(D | H) \) might be higher, interpreting this as more likely for a humanities professor. Let's assume \( P(D | H) = 0.7 \).

We substitute these values into the equation for \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.3.
