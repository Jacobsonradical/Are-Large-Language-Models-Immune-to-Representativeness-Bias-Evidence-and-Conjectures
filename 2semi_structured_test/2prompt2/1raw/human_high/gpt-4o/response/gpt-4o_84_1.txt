To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: This is the proportion of humanities professors in the total sample. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: This is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor. Without specific data, we can make an educated guess that the description which highlights creative, imaginative, and non-technical traits might be less common for computer science professors. For argument's sake, letâ€™s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \).

4. **Complementary likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: This is the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor. Given that the description suits a humanities professor more, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \).

5. **Overall probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the total probability of the description. We calculate it using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.428 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.428.
