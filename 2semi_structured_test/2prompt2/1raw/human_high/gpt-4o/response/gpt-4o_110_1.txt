To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (HUM): \( P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's denote the description fitting a professor as \( D \).
   - While we don't have exact numerical values for the likelihoods, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the description provided.

Given that the description highlights subjective qualities such as creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of technical inclination, it is reasonable to infer that these traits might better match the humanities professors.

Thus, we would assign probabilities:
   - Probability that a professor in CS matches the description \( P(D | CS) \approx \text{low} \). Let's assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \).
   - Probability that a professor in HUM matches the description \( P(D | HUM) \approx \text{high} \). Let's assume \( P(D | HUM) = 0.7 \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

Where:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM)
   \]

Let's calculate \( P(D) \):
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.15 + 0.175
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.325
   \]

Now compute \( P(CS | D) \):
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.325}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | D) \approx 0.4615
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4615.
