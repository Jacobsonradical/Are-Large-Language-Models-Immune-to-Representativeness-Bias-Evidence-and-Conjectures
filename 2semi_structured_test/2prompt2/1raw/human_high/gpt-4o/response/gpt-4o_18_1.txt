To find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description matches Jason.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the descriptions are chosen randomly and we need to update based on the new information (Jason's description), we can consider the likelihoods:

Let's assume \( P(B|\text{CS}) \) is the probability that someone with Jason's description is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \) is the probability that someone with Jason's description is a humanities professor. Given Jason's description, it seems more aligned with the traits typically associated with humanities professors, especially given the specific information about creativity, passion without technicality, and emotional drive.

For simplicity, let's estimate these probabilities qualitatively:

Letâ€™s assign some proportional values just for an example:
\[ P(B|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(B|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can apply these values to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, the answer is: {"probability": "0.4286"}
