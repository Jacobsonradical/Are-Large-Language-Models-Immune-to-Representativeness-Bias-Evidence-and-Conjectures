To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the given description.

We need to determine the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \), the probability of the description overall.

The prior probabilities can be calculated based on the sample size:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we don't have specific likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)), we'll assume based on the description that it's more likely Jason is a humanities professor because his traits seem more aligned with the typical traits of humanities professors. Let's make some reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes:
- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \), i.e., there is a 20% chance that a randomly selected computer science professor has these traits.
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \), i.e., there is an 80% chance that a randomly selected humanities professor has these traits.

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
