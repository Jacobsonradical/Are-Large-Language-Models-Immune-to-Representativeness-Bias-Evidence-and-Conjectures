To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We start with the base rates, which tell us that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(Hum) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we consider how likely someone with Jason's described traits would be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical.

These traits seem to align more closely with what might be stereotypically expected of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume that the probability of someone with Jason's traits being a humanities professor (P(Desc | Hum)) is higher than being a computer science professor (P(Desc | CS)). Without specific data, we could make a reasonable assumption, such as:
- P(Desc | Hum) = 0.8 (higher likelihood given the match of traits)
- P(Desc | CS) = 0.2 (lower likelihood given the match of traits)

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:
\[
Numerator = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15
\]
\[
Denominator = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

So,
\[
P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.43.
