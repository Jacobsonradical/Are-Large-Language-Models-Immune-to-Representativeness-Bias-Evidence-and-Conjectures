To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his personality description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. First, we calculate the prior probabilities and then update them based on the given description:

1. Prior probability of being a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. Prior probability of being a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

Next, we need to account for how likely Jason's description fits each group:

- From the description, Jason appears more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical).

Let's assume the likelihoods based on the description align more closely with humanities professors. For simplicity, let's assign:
\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2
\]
\[
P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8
\]

Bayes' theorem gives us the posterior probability:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Thus:
\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
