To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be stated as follows:

\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | T) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( T \).
- \( P(T | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(T) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given the initial setup:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we are choosing Jason randomly, we should pay attention to how well the description fits typical profiles of the two groups. The description portrays Jason as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical." These traits might be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors, who might generally be expected to be more technical.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T | CS) \) as the likelihood of a computer science professor matching Jason's description.
- \( P(T | H) \) as the likelihood of a humanities professor matching Jason's description.

If we assume that \( P(T | CS) \) is lower compared to \( P(T | H) \):
- Let’s take an estimated \( P(T | CS) = 0.2 \).
- And \( P(T | H) = 0.8 \).

Now we proceed to calculate \( P(T) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(T) = P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(T | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(T) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)} \]
\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | T) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | T) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.43"}
