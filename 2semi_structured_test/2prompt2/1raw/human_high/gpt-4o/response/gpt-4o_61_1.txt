To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) represents the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) represents the event that Jason fits the given description.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor ( \( P(A) \) )**:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor ( \( P(A^c) \) )**:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor ( \( P(B|A) \) )**:
Given the description, Jason seems more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. For the sake of estimation, let's assign:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \]

4. **Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor ( \( P(B|A^c) \) )**:
Let's assign a higher likelihood here, considering Jason's description aligns closely with traits associated with humanities:
\[ P(B|A^c) \approx 0.8 \]

5. **Total probability of the description \( P(B) \)**:
This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.43.
