To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's start by defining the relevant probabilities:

- The prior probability \(P(CS)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) that Jason is a humanities professor is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to consider how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the description:

- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and is not particularly technical. This description might be less typical of a computer science professor and more typical of a humanities professor. 

Let's denote:

- \(E\) as the event of having the description given for Jason.
- \(P(E|CS)\) as the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \(P(E|H)\) as the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Assuming these descriptive probabilities reflect typical stereotypes:
- \(P(E|CS)\) might be relatively low, say 0.2 (hypothetical estimate).
- \(P(E|H)\) might be relatively high, say 0.8 (hypothetical estimate).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \(P(CS|E)\):

\[P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}\]

Where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the event \(E\):

\[P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)\]

Substituting the values:
\[P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35\]

Now, we find \(P(CS|E)\):

\[P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is approximately 0.4286.
