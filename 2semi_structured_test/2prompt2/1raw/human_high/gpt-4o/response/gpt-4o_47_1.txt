Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the priors:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100, so:
  \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100, so:
  \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we need to estimate \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \):
- The description mentions Jason is "not particularly technical", which may be less likely for a computer science professor and more likely for a humanities professor.

- Let's assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is relatively low due to the non-technical nature, say \( 0.2 \).

- Conversely, assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \) is relatively high, say \( 0.8 \).

Next, we calculate the overall probability of the description, \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore:
\[ {"probability": "0.4286"} \]
