Let's break this down using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. The formula is:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's what we have:
- We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability (before considering the description) of picking a computer science professor is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of picking a humanities professor is \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, we need to consider the likelihoods. Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.

The description leans towards characteristics that are typically more associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Thus, \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \) is likely higher than \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \).

Given we are choosing these probabilities, let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) = 0.8 \)

To find the overall probability of the description, \( P(\text{Desc}) \):
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Desc}) = 0.35 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
