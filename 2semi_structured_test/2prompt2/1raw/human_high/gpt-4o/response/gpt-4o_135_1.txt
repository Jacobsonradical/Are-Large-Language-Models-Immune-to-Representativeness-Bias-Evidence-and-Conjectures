To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let’s define the probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability that Jason is a CS professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) = prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(D | CS) \) = probability of Jason’s description given that he is a CS professor
- \( P(D | H) \) = probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor

What we need to find is \( P(CS | D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description D.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description D and is given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]

From the description, Jason seems to have traits which are more aligned with a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technically oriented). Let’s assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (since he doesn’t fit the typical CS professor profile)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (since he fits the typical humanities professor profile better)

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Answer: 
{"probability": "0.4286"}
