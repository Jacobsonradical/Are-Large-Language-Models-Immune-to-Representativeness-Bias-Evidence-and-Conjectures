To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define the relevant information:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that a professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  \[
  P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|Hum)\). Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with traits often associated with humanities professors than those typically ascribed to computer science professors.

If we make reasonable assumptions:
- Let's assume \(P(D|CS)\) is low because Jason does not exhibit strong technical traits commonly associated with computer science professors. We might estimate this as a low value, say \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\).

- Let's assume \(P(D|Hum)\) is high because Jason's traits are more aligned with humanities professors. We might estimate this as a higher value, say \(P(D|Hum) = 0.9\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
where 
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

First, calculate the denominator \(P(D)\):
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Then, calculate \(P(CS|D)\):
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is \(0.25\).

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
