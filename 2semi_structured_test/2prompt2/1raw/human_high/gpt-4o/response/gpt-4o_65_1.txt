To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the relevant components for Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))

Since personality traits described are generally more aligned with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), let's assign some hypothetical likelihood values:
   - \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\)
   - \(P(D|H) = 0.9\)

3. **Posterior probability calculation:**
   - We need to calculate \(P(CS|D)\) (the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description).

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.30 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
