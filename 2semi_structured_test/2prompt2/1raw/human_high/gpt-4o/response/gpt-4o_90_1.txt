To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem in the context of this problem can be stated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need to calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(CS) \)**:

   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability, \( P(H) \)**:

   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(D | CS) \)** and \( P(D | H) \):

   These represent the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Based on the description being emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, it may be more characteristic of a humanities professor. As these exact probabilities are not given, let's make a reasonable assumption:

   Let \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \)  (since the description is less likely for a computer science professor) 
   and \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \)   (since the description is more likely for a humanities professor).

4. **Total Probability, \( P(D) \)**:

   This is a weighted sum of the description probability for both groups:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
