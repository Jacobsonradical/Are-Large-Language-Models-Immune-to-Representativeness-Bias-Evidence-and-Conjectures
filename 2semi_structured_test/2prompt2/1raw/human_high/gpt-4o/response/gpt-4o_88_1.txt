To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the Prior Probabilities (Base Rates):**
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS), \( P(\text{CS}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (H), \( P(\text{H}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{\text{Number of H professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Determine the Likelihoods:**
   Based on the description of Jason, we note aspects like creativity, being emotionally driven, not particularly technical, passionate, which might be more prevalent among humanities professors compared to computer science professors.

   Let's denote:
   - Likelihood of the description given the professor is from CS, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \)
   - Likelihood of the description given the professor is from H, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \)

   Without exact numbers, we make a reasonable assumption:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \quad \text{(less likely among CS professors)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.8 \quad \text{(more likely among humanities professors)}
   \]

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
   \]

   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.4286"}}
\]
