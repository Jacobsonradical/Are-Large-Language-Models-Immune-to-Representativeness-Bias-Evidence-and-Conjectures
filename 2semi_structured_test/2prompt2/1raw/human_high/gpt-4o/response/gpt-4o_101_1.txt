To evaluate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of the description.

First, letâ€™s establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A = \text{CS}) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A = \text{Humanities}) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A = \text{CS}) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical), it seems less likely. We might suppose a value like 0.3.
- \( P(B|A = \text{Humanities}) \) = Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. This description seems more likely for a humanities professor. We might suppose a value like 0.7.

Now, calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A = \text{CS}) \cdot P(A = \text{CS}) + P(B|A = \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(A = \text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.175 = 0.4 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A = \text{CS}) \cdot P(A = \text{CS})}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{(0.3 \cdot 0.75)}{0.4} \]

\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]

\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = 0.5625 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.5625.

So the answer is:
{"probability": "0.5625"}
