To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided (Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.).

We need these components:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with typical traits of humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's denote these probabilities as follows:
- Let’s assume \( P(B|A) \) (the probability that Jason is described as such when he is a computer science professor) is relatively low, say 0.2.
- Let’s assume \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability that Jason is described as such when he is a humanities professor) is relatively high, say 0.7.

Bayes' Theorem gives us:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{32.5} \approx 0.462 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.462.
