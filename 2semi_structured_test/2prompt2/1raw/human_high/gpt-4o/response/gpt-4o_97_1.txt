To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the answer:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). In simpler terms, how likely is the description to fit a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical"), it seems more aligned with stereotypical traits often associated with humanities rather than computer science.

For the sake of calculation, let's make a reasonable estimation:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (This is a hypothetical estimate; you might adjust it based on additional information or studies)
   - \( P(D|Hum) = 0.9 \)

3. **Posterior Probability** (using Bayes' Theorem):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
where \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \)

Calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
