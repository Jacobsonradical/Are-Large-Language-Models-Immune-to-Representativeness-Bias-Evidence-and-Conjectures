To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be expressed as:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

Here are the steps to calculate this:

1. **Prior probability \(P(CS)\)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Prior probability \(P(H)\)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(D | CS)\)** and \(P(D | H)**: To accurately estimate these, we would typically need more detailed information about the personalities of the professors in each field. However, based on the provided description that emphasizes creativity, imagination, and an emotionally driven nature while not being particularly technical, these traits might generally be considered more common in humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

   For the sake of this calculation, letâ€™s make an educated guess (assuming a stronger association of these traits with humanities):
   \[
   P(D | CS) \approx 0.2
   \]
   \[
   P(D | H) \approx 0.8
   \]

4. **Total probability \(P(D)\)**: This is calculated by considering both groups.
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\boxed{\{ "probability": "0.43" \}}
\]
