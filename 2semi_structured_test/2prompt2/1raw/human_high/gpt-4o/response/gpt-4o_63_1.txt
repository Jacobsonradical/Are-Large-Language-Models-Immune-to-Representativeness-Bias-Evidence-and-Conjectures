Given the description provided for Jason, we need to determine the probability that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. 

First, we should consider the base rates (prior probabilities) of each group:
- 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors -> P(CS) = 0.75
- 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors -> P(H) = 0.25

Next, we should evaluate the likelihood of the given description fitting each group. Given what we typically know about computer science and humanities professors, the description mentioned—creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, gifted and passionate but not particularly technical—seems to align more strongly with stereotypical traits associated with humanities professors. 

For simplicity, assume:
- The likelihood of this description for a humanities professor might be quite high, say P(D|H) = 0.8.
- The likelihood of this description for a computer science professor might be lower, say P(D|CS) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.3 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.425 \]

Then,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.425} = \frac{0.225}{0.425} \approx 0.529 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
