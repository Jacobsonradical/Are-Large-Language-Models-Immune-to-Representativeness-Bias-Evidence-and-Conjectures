To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the described personality traits.

We need to calculate each part of this equation:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of having Jason's personality traits given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason doesn't exhibit traits that align closely with the stereotypical traits of computer scientists, who might be more technical and less emotionally driven. Let's assume a lower likelihood, say 0.2.

3. \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of having Jason's personality traits given that he is a humanities professor:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
Humanities professors might be more likely to have such personality traits. Let's assume a higher likelihood, say 0.7.

4. \( P(B) \): The total probability of having Jason's personality traits:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{32.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.4615 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4615.
