To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the sample, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we consider Jason's description. He is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate, but not particularly technical. These traits typically align more with humanities professors than computer science professors, who are more likely to be analytical and technical.

While we don't have exact probabilities for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can reasonably assume that \( P(D|CS) < P(D|H) \). For simplicity, let's hypothesize:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.2 \times 0.75 + 0.8 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.

In the required format:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
