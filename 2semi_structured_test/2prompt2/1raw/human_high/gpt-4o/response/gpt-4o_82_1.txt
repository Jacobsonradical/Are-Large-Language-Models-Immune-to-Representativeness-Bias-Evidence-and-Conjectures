To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): 75 out of 100 professors.
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): 25 out of 100 professors.
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description "Jason" for both computer science professors and humanities professors.
     - Given the description, "Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and is not particularly technical," it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.
     - Letâ€™s arbitrarily assign likelihoods based on the description:
       - Likelihood of the description for a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)): 0.2
       - Likelihood of the description for a humanities professor (P(Description | H)): 0.8

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) * P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | H) * P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(Description) = 0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

   Now:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.4286 \).
