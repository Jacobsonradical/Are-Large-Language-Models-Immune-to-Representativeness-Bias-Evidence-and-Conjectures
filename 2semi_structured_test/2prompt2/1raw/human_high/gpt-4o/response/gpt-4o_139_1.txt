To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- We are given a description of Jason and must assess the likelihood based on that.

To apply Bayes' theorem, let's start with the prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we need an estimate for the likelihoods. These are more subjective, but we can use the provided description to guide our probability estimates:
- P(description | CS) = likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description.
- P(description | H) = likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description.

Based on the description:
- Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" - traits more stereotypically associated with the humanities.
- Jason is "not particularly technical," which may also lean towards being a humanities professor.

Let’s assign some subjective probabilities based on these observations. Suppose:
- P(description | CS) = 0.2 (due to less alignment with computer science traits)
- P(description | H) = 0.8 (due to higher alignment with humanities traits)

Now apply Bayes’ theorem to find P(CS | description):

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where,
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | H) \times P(H) \]

So we calculate:
\[ P(description) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.
