To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is defined as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given about Jason.

First, letâ€™s define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description regardless of the discipline.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A) \)
The prior probability \( P(A) \) is simply the proportion of computer science professors among the total professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it might be more typical for humanities professors. To simplify, let's assume a hypothetical value:
- \( P(B|A) \) = 0.2
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) = 0.8

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.43 \]

The posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.43.

So, the answer should be given in the format requested:
