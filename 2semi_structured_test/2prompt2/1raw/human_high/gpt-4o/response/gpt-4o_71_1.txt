To update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we need to weigh the prior probabilities by the likelihood of the description fitting a professor from each group.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group, \( P(Hum) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description suggests attributes that may be more common in humanities professors (e.g., "creative and imaginative" and "not particularly technical"). Thus, the likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description, \( P(Description | Hum) \), is higher than for a computer science professor, \( P(Description | CS) \). For simplification, let's assume \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.9 \) and \( P(Description | CS) = 0.1 \). These are subjective probabilities reflecting that the description is much more likely for a humanities professor.

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
   \]

   Now calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   \[
   \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
   \]
