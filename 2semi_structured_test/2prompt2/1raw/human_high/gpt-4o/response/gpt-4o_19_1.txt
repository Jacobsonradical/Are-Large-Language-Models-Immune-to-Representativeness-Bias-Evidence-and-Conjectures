Given the description of Jason, we need to evaluate the likelihood that he is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. To do this, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem, which combines prior probabilities with likelihoods.

Firstly, let's establish the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probability (P(CS)) that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]
  and the prior probability (P(H)) that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities is:
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given each category.

- Given his description, we assess the typical characteristics:
  - "Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven"
  - "Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring"
  - "Not particularly technical"

Although these traits can be found in both fields, they may be more strongly associated with humanities professors, who might typically be perceived as more creative and less technical than those in computer science.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

While exact numbers are difficult to specify without explicit data, we can qualitatively assume \( P(D|H) > P(D|CS) \) due to the nature of the attributes mentioned.

Let's reasonably estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) 
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

In the required format:
