To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting Jason's description.

We need:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of getting Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Without specific data on \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we must rely on the description given. Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading) seem more aligned with typical humanities attributes.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \): The probability that a computer science professor fits Jason’s description.
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \): The probability that a humanities professor fits Jason’s description.

Finally, we calculate the overall probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.4286"} \]
