To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we first need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Given:
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(A') \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

To proceed, we need to make an assumption about the likelihoods:
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)): This is subjective, but given the description highlights creative, emotionally driven traits which are less typical for computer science professors, we might assume this likelihood is lower. Let's estimate it as 0.2.
- Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(B|A') \)): Given these traits are more typical for humanities professors, we might estimate this likelihood higher, say 0.8.

Now, \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description, can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability (\( P(A|B) \)):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.43.
