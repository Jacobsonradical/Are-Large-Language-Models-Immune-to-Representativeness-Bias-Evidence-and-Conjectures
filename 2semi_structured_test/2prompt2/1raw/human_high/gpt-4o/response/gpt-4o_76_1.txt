To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Here, the prior probabilities are based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(A = \text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A = \text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate \( P(B|A = \text{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A = \text{Humanities}) \), the likelihoods of the description given each group.

Given the description of Jason, it seems he aligns more with traits commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally-driven, passionate, not particularly technical). We will denote these subjective likelihood estimates as follows:
- \( P(B|A = \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|A = \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.8 \)

Now we can find the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A = \text{CS}) \cdot P(A = \text{CS}) + P(B|A = \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(A = \text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A = \text{CS}) \cdot P(A = \text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A = \text{CS}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
