To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS | D) \): Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Likelihood of the description being applicable to a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): Likelihood of the description being applicable to a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]

Given the sample sizes:
- Number of computer science professors \( = 75 \)
- Number of humanities professors \( = 25 \)
- Total number of professors \( = 100 \)

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the descriptions. Based on the description given, "Jason is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven. Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical." This description appears to align more closely with common traits associated with humanities professors than computer science professors, who are typically seen as more technical.

Thus, we can reasonably infer:
\[ P(D | CS) \text{ might be quite low, say } 0.2 \]
\[ P(D | H) \text{ might be quite high, say } 0.8 \]

So the posterior probability calculation becomes:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.2 \times 0.75 + 0.8 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
