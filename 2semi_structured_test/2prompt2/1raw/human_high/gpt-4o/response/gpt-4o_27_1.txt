To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (the posterior probability we're trying to find).
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of obtaining Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of obtaining Jason's description under any circumstances.

Let's denote:
- \(A_c\) as the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \(A_h\) as the event that Jason is one of the humanities professors.

We know:
- \(P(A_c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(A_h) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

However, we need to assume or estimate the likelihoods \(P(B|A_c)\) and \(P(B|A_h)\). Given Jason's description indicates he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring, is gifted and passionate but not particularly technical, these traits seem less stereotypically aligned with computer science professors and more with humanities professors. Thus, we might assume:

- \(P(B|A_c)\) (the likelihood of a computer science professor fitting this description) is relatively low.
- \(P(B|A_h)\) (the likelihood of a humanities professor fitting this description) is relatively high.

Given these assumptions, let's take:
- \(P(B|A_c) = 0.2\)
- \(P(B|A_h) = 0.7\)

Now, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[P(B) = P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c) + P(B|A_h) \cdot P(A_h)\]
\[P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25)\]
\[P(B) = 0.15 + 0.175\]
\[P(B) = 0.325\]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[P(A_c|B) = \frac{P(B|A_c) \cdot P(A_c)}{P(B)}\]
\[P(A_c|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325}\]
\[P(A_c|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.325}\]
\[P(A_c|B) = \frac{15}{32.5}\]
\[P(A_c|B) \approx 0.462\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.462.
