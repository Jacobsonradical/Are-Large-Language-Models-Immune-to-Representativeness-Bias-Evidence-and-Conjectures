To compute the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities.

First, let's identify the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). 

The description indicates that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, and not particularly technical. It seems more consistent with common stereotypes of humanities professors than with those of computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is low.
- \( P(D | H) \) is high.

To continue, let's use reasonable estimates for these likelihoods:
- Suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \).
- Suppose \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \).

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
