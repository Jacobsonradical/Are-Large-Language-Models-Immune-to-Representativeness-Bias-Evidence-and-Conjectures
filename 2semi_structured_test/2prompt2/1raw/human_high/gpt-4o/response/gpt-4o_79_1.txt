To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of hypothesis \( A \) (Jason being a computer science professor) given data \( B \) (the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of data \( B \) given hypothesis \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of data \( B \).

Firstly, we establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to assess the likelihood \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \). Given the description suggests traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and being not particularly technical, we might infer that these traits are more aligned with the humanities than computer science, though this is an assumption based on stereotype. Assuming the psychologists' tests and descriptions are accurate and stereotypes hold some weight, let's say:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the marginal likelihood:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.35 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.4286 \).

Answer: {"probability": "0.4286"}
