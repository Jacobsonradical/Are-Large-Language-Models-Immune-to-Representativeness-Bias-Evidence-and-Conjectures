To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description, we need to estimate the likelihood of such descriptions for both computer science and humanities professors (\( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \)).

Jason's description ("creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical") seems to align more closely with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than technical computer science professors. Let's assume \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) is relatively lower than \( P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \):

Let's assign some reasonable estimates:
\[ P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) = 0.8 \]

Now, calculate the total probability of the description (\( P(B) \)):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286 or 42.86%.
