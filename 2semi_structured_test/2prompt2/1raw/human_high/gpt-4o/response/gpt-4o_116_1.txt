To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's summarize the given information:

1. The study includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. A description of Jason is provided, and we need to determine the likelihood of Jason being in one of these two groups.

Given the total number of professors, the prior probabilities are:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(H)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Now we need to consider the likelihood of Jason fitting the description coming from each group, which can be a little subjective and based on stereotypes:

- The description given for Jason includes being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, characteristics which might be somewhat less common in the field of computer science and more common in the humanities. 

Let's denote:
- P(D|CS) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D|H) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Assume we estimate these as:
- P(D|CS) = 0.2 (Jason's description is less typical for Computer Science)
- P(D|H) = 0.8 (Jason's description is more typical for Humanities)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability for Jason being a computer science professor (P(CS|D)):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

\[
= \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
= \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]

\[
= \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
