To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps for the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a CS professor: \( P(D | CS) \).
   - Likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(D | H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \( P(D) \) can be expressed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

Given that Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical", these traits seem more aligned with typically perceived characteristics of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

Without the exact likelihood values, we can qualitatively infer \( P(D | H) > P(D | CS) \). Let's make a simplified estimation:

Assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \).

4. **Calculating Exact Posterior Probability with estimated values:**

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
