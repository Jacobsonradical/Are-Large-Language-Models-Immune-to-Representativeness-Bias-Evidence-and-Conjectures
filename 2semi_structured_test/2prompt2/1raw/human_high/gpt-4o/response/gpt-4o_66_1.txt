To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a random professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a random professor is from the humanities (HUM): \( P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need an estimate of how likely it is for Jason's description to apply to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Let's denote:
     - \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a CS professor.
     - \( P(D | HUM) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
     
Given Jason's creative and imaginative traits, emotionally driven nature, and not particularly technical detail, it seems more indicative of a humanities professor. Let's assume:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (these personality traits are less common among CS professors)
   - \( P(D | HUM) = 0.8 \) (these personality traits are more common among humanities professors)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

   Therefore:
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

So, the posterior probability is:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

In conclusion:
