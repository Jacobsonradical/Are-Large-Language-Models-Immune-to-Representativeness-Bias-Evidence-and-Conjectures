To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define our terms:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid D) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (our target).
- \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( n_{\text{CS}} = 75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( n_{\text{Humanities}} = 25 \)).
- The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To use Bayesâ€™ theorem, we calculate:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Given Jason's description, he seems more aligned with typical traits often associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). Therefore, we might estimate:

- \( P(D \mid \text{CS}) \) might be relatively low, say 0.2.
- \( P(D \mid \text{Humanities}) \) might be higher, say 0.8.

Plugging these into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability is:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
