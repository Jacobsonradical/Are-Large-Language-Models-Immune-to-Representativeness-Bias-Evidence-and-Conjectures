To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior probability:** The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science before considering the description.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities:

\[ P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let's denote the characteristics described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.) as \( D \).

   - We need the probability of the description given the professor is in computer science, \( P(D | CS) \), and the probability of the description given the professor is in the humanities, \( P(D | HUM) \).
   
   I will make an assumption based on general knowledge that the description provided (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) may be more common among humanities professors compared to computer science professors. Therefore, let's assume:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(D | HUM) = 0.7 \)

3. **Posterior probability** calculated using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

\[ = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ = 0.15 + 0.175 \]
\[ = 0.325 \]

So the posterior probability is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325} \]
\[ = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ \approx 0.462 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.462.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.462"}
