To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and additional evidence.

First, we need to consider the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we must consider how likely Jason's personality description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Although we do not have detailed data on these probabilities, we can make some assumptions based on the description.

Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical. These traits might be more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors given the traditional views of these fields.

Letâ€™s denote:
- P(Description | CS) as the probability of this description given a computer science professor.
- P(Description | H) as the probability of this description given a humanities professor.

Given that the description aligns more closely with common perceptions of humanities professors, we might estimate:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \approx 0.8 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \times P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can find the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
