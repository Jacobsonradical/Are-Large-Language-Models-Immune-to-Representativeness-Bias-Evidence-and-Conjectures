To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Similarly, we need:
- \( P(H | D) \) is the probability Jason is a humanities professor given the description.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

However, without additional data on how likely each description is for computer science vs. humanities professors, we need to make some assumptions based on the given description and the typical association of personality traits with each field. 

Since Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, but "not particularly technical," these traits tend to align more closely with common stereotypes of humanities professors than with computer science professors, who might be stereotypically perceived as more analytical and technical.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (since the description seems less typical for CS)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (since the description seems more typical for humanities)

We calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
