To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

First, we need to set our prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description being observed.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (he is a humanities professor).

Given the information in the description, we observe that it fits general traits more commonly associated with humanities professors based on creativity, imagination, and lack of technical emphasis. We can make educated guesses for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (since the description doesn't strongly fit a typical computer science professor).
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \) (since the description fits well with a humanities professor).

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
