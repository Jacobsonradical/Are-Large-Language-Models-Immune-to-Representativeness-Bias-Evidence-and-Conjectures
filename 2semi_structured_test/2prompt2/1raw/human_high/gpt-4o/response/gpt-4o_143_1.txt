To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here is how we can apply it:

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (C) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 25
- Prior probability of any given professor being a computer science professor, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Prior probability of any given professor being a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We are given Jason's description, and we want to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description.

Let's denote:
- \( P(E|C) \) as the probability that Jason has the given description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|H) \) as the probability that Jason has the given description if he is a humanities professor.

We need additional assumptions here:
- Given the description (emotionally driven, imaginative, not technical), it seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. For simplicity, we can assume:
  - \( P(E|C) \approx 0.1 \) (10% chance a randomly chosen computer science professor matches this description)
  - \( P(E|H) \approx 0.8 \) (80% chance a randomly chosen humanities professor matches this description)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substituting the numbers:
\[
P(C|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
P(E) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
\]

Now calculate \( P(C|E) \):
\[
P(C|E) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
\]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.273.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.273"}
