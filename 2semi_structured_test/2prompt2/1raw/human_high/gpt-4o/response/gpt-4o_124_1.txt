To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Complement Prior Probability \(P(\neg A)\)**:
   - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)**:
   - Based on the description, Jason seems to fit more with the humanities professors (creative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).
   - Let's assume the probability that a computer science professor has Jason's traits is low, say \(P(B|A) = 0.1\).

4. **Likelihood \(P(B|\neg A)\)**:
   - The probability that a humanities professor has Jason's traits is higher.
   - Let's assume this probability is \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.8\).

5. **Total Probability \(P(B)\)**:
   - \(P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \)
   - \(P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)\)
   - \(P(B) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275\)

6. **Posterior Probability \(P(A|B)\)**:
   - \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)
   - \(P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \)
   - \(P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \)
   - \(P(A|B) \approx 0.273\)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.273.
