To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observation of Jason's personality traits.

Let's define the necessary probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(A) = 0.75 \).
- \( P(A') \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. This is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of observing Jason's described personality traits if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \): The probability of observing Jason's described personality traits if he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description - “creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical” - these traits appear more aligned with the humanities than with computer science, which typically involves more technical traits.

While we don't have exact probabilities for these likelihoods, we can make an informed estimation based on the description.

Let’s reasonably assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \): Computer science professors matching Jason's description are less common.
- \( P(B|A') = 0.8 \): Humanities professors matching Jason's description are more common.

Now we calculate the total probability of \( B \), \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.
