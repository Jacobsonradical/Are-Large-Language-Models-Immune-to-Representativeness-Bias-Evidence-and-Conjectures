To estimate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start with the base rates (priors) and update them based on the given description.

First, note the prior probabilities:
- Probability Jason is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability Jason is from humanities (\( P(H) \)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, consider the description. The description indicates that Jason is creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical. These traits might be perceived as more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. 

Let:
- \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) be the overall probability of the description.

While the exact probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are not explicitly given, we can make a reasonable assessment that the description fits better with the typical profile of a humanities professor. Assume \( P(D|H) \) is higher than \( P(D|CS) \). For argument's sake, let's hypothesize:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now calculate the overall probability \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.429 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.429"}
