To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Assess Likelihoods:**
   - Based on the description, Jason does not seem very technical but is emotionally driven, creative, and enjoys activities that are often associated with the humanities. We will assign conditional probabilities for the likelihood of observing such a description in both fields:
     - P(Description | CS): Given that computer science professors are generally more technical, let's assume this likelihood is relatively low, say 0.2.
     - P(Description | H): Given that humanities professors are often associated with the traits described, let's assume this likelihood is higher, say 0.8.

3. **Calculate Evidence:**
   - P(Description): This is the total probability of the description occurring, which can be calculated by the law of total probability:
     \[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
     \[ P(Description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
     \[ P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We can now find the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
     \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
     \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
     \[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{15}{35} \]
     \[ P(CS | Description) = 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
