To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break down these components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(CS) \):**
   This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor. 

   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

   Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is 0.25.

2. **Probability of the description given a computer science professor \( P(D|CS) \):**
   This requires subjective judgment. Given that the description emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, not particularly technical, and so on, it might be less typical for computer science professors and more typical for humanities professors. Let's hypothetically estimate:

   \[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]

3. **Probability of the description given a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \):**
   This again requires subjective judgment. Given the description matches more closely with commonly associated traits of humanities professors, let's estimate:

   \[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

4. **Total probability of the description \( P(D) \):**
   This is found by combining the probabilities for both groups using the law of total probability:

   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
