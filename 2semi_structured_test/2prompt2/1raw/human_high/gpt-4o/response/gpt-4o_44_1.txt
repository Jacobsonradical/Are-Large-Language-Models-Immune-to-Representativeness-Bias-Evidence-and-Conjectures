To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

Starting with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(A_{H}) \), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To apply Bayes’ theorem, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. 
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on Jason’s description, which emphasizes creativity, imagination, sensitivity, exploration, and lack of technical inclination, these traits align more closely with the characteristics typically associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:

- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is likely low.
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) is likely high.

Now combining these:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H})} \]

Given that \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) is low and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) is high, we can approximate this by noting the respective weights of the priors (0.75 for computer science and 0.25 for humanities). 

Assuming some intuitive values:
- Let \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- Let \( P(B|A_{H}) \approx 0.8 \)

Then:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
