To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

1. **Calculate \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \)**:
   - Jasonâ€™s description suggests traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and non-technicality.
   - These traits might be more common in humanities professors compared to computer science professors.
   - Let's assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (because the description fits less with typical computer science traits).
   - Let's assume \( P(D | H) = 0.7 \) (because the description fits more with typical humanities traits).

3. **Calculate \( P(D) \) :**
   - \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \)

4. **Calculate \( P(CS | D) \)**:
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \)
   - \( P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \)

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
