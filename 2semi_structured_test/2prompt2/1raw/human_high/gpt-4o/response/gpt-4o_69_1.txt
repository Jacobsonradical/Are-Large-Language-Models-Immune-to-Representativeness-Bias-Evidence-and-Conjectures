To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor.

We need to find the probability \( P(C | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. We will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We also need \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \): The probability of the given description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \): The probability of the given description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description provided for Jason ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"), it seems more likely to describe a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, we do not have exact probabilities for these descriptions, so let's assign subjective probabilities based on the description fitting a humanities professor better. Suppose:

- \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.7 \)

Now calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.4 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = 0.5625 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
