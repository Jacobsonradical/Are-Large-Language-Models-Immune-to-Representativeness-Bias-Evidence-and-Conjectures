To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates and the likelihood of the description matching a professor in either group.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the base rates, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus,
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with humanities than computer science.

However, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \): Likelihood of this description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \): Likelihood of this description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Let's assume these likelihoods based on the traits described:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) = 0.2 \) (less common for computer science)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) = 0.8 \) (more common for humanities)

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \):
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
