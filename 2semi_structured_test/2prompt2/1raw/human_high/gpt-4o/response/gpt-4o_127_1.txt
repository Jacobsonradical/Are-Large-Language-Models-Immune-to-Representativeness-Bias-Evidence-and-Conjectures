To answer this question, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Our goal is to find the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given for Jason.

We want to find \( P(CS \mid D) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we need to consider the other possibility:
\[ P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D \mid CS) P(CS) + P(D \mid H) P(H) \), we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) P(CS) + P(D \mid H) P(H)} \]

We need to estimate these probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \), the prior probability of being a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, and not particularly technical, it seems more in line with typical traits of someone in the humanities rather than computer science.

Let's assign plausible likelihood estimates:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.1 \) (since it is less likely that a computer science professor would have these humanities-oriented traits).
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.7 \) (since it is more likely that a humanities professor would have these traits).

Now we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{(0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25)} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
{"probability": "0.3"}
