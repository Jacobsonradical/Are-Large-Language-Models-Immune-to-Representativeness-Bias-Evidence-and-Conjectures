To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here is the formula for Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description of Jason.

We are asked to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, let's find the prior probabilities (\( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \)):
- \( P(A) \), the probability that the professor is in computer science before knowing the description:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that the professor is in the humanities:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on Jason's description (creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with the typical profile of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. We can make an educated guess about these probabilities:

- Let's say \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \)
- And \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.9 \)

Finally, we need \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
