To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
    - The probability of picking a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) \).
    - The probability of picking a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \).
    - The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

3. **Posterior Probabilities**:
    - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description: \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \).

First, letâ€™s assign the prior probabilities based on the given information:

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods. From the description, Jason seems more likely to fit the profile of a humanities professor due to traits like being emotionally driven, creative, and imaginative, which are commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science. Therefore, we can reasonably hypothesize the following:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) is relatively high.

While exact numeric likelihoods are not provided, we have to make estimates based on the described traits. Let us assume:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be calculated as:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
\]

So:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is \( 0.25 \).
