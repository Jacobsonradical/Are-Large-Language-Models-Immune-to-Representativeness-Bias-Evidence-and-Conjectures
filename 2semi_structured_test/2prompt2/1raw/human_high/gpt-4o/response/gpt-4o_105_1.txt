To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description in the overall sample.

We start with the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

If we assume that the description fits humanities professors (H) better than computer science professors (CS), we might estimate:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.2 \) (CS professors are less likely to fit this description).
- \( P(D | Hum) \approx 0.8 \) (Humanities professors are more likely to fit this description).

Using the law of total probability for the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286, or 0.43 (rounded to two decimal places).
