Using Bayes' Theorem, we can update our prior beliefs based on the given evidence. Let's denote:

- C_s: Jason is a computer science professor.
- C_h: Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are based on the proportions in the sample:
- P(C_s) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(C_h) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description given that Jason is either a computer science professor or humanities professor. Based on the description, Jason appears to have traits that might be more commonly associated with humanities professors (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

Let's denote the description by D. We need P(D | C_s) and P(D | C_h). These probabilities are not given explicitly, so we might use our intuition based on the description. Assigning subjective likelihoods, we might hypothesize:
- P(D | C_s) = 0.1 (computer science professors are less likely to exhibit these traits)
- P(D | C_h) = 0.9 (humanities professors are more likely to exhibit these traits)

Applying Bayes' theorem to find P(C_s | D):
\[ 
P(C_s | D) = \frac{P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(D)}
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(D) = P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s) + P(D | C_h) \cdot P(C_h)
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[ 
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]
Now calculate the posterior probability:
\[ 
P(C_s | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
