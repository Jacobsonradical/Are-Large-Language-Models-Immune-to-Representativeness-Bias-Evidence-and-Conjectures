To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( CS \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description provided for Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description.

We have to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

### Prior Probabilities
Based on our sample:
- \( P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 \)

### Likelihoods
Given the description, Jason seems to fit more closely with characteristics typical of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). 

For simplicity, let's assign:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (because typically, these traits might be less common in computer science professors)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (because these traits are more common among humanities professors)

### Total Probability of the Description
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

### Posterior Probability
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.4286"} \]
