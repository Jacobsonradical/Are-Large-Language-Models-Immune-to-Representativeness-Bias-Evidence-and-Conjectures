To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): Likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Marginal probability of the description.

To start with, let's determine the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\neg A) = P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a computer science professor fits the description of Jason.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that a humanities professor fits the description of Jason.

Based on the description, Jason seems to fit less with the stereotypical traits of a technical computer science professor and more with those of a humanities professor. 

Let's approximate:
- Suppose \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (given that not particularly technical seems less likely for CS).
- Suppose \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.7 \) (humanities professors are more likely to fit this profile).

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.462 \]

Therefore, my posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.462. 

Here is the answer in the requested format:
