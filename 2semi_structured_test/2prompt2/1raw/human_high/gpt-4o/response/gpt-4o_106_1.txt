To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's identify each term in the context of this problem:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting Jason's description, regardless of his field.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, we identify \( P(A) \), the prior probability:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we identify \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that he is a humanities professor:
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We now need the likelihoods, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \). These represent how typical Jason's description is for computer science and humanities professors, respectively. Without specific probabilities, we must make reasonable assumptions based on the description:
- Jason's description appears to describe someone who is more likely a humanities professor due to traits like "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and "not particularly technical."

For the sake of completeness, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.2 \] (since not being particularly technical is less likely in CS)
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \] (since the description fits humanities academics better)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429.

Here is the answer in the required format:
