Firstly, let's establish the base rates for the two groups. There are 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities professors, making the prior probabilities for being in each group:

P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75  
P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to assess how likely it is that Jason, with his given personality description, would be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, though "not particularly technical." These traits seem more aligned with typical descriptions of individuals in the humanities than in computer science, where being "technical" is often a key characteristic.

Given this information, let's denote:
P(Description | CS) = probability that a randomly chosen CS professor would have Jason's personality description  
P(Description | Humanities) = probability that a randomly chosen humanities professor would have Jason's personality description

Since Jason is described as "not particularly technical," it is reasonable to assume that this personality fits better with the humanities group. Thus:
P(Description | Humanities) > P(Description | CS)

However, without concrete numbers, we need to make some assumptions based on perceived likelihoods. Suppose we overstate the case and assign:
P(Description | CS) = 0.2  (low, but not impossible for a CS professor to fit this description)  
P(Description | Humanities) = 0.8  (high likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description)

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(CS | Description) = [P(Description | CS) * P(CS)] / [P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) * P(Humanities)]

Subbing in the numbers:

P(CS | Description) = [0.2 * 0.75] / [0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25]  
                   = [0.15] / [0.15 + 0.2]  
                   = 0.15 / 0.35  
                   = 0.4286

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.
