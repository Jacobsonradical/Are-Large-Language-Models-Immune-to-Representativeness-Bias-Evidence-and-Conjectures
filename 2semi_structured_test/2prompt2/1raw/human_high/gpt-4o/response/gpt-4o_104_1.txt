Given the description, the specific traits presented suggest that Jason’s characteristics might align more closely with those typically found in the humanities compared to computer science. 

However, calculating the posterior probability can be approached through Bayesian reasoning.

The prior probabilities are based on the sample size:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Considering the traits described, let’s consider the likelihoods for these traits in each group:
- The description being typical for a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) might be lower given that computer science professors are often perceived as more technical.
- The description fitting a humanities professor (P(Description | H)) might be higher due to the emphasis on creativity, imagination, and emotional drive.

For simplicity, let’s estimate these likelihoods based on the description:
- P(Description | CS) might be, for example, 0.2
- P(Description | H) might be, for example, 0.8

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(H | Description) = \frac{P(Description | H) \times P(H)}{P(Description)} \]

First, find the normalizing constant P(Description):
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now calculate the posterior probability for computer science:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429. Putting this value into the requested format:
