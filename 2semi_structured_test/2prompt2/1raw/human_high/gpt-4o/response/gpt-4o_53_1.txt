To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, you need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event A (Jason being a CS professor) given event B (the description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of event B (the description) given event A (Jason being a CS professor).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A (Jason being a CS professor), which is the proportion of CS professors in the sample.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of event B (the description).

Let's assign these values:

1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor:
   - There are 75 CS professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor:
   - This is subjective, but we can assume that someone who is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate though not particularly technical" is less likely to be a CS professor, given the general stereotype of the field.
   - Let’s assign this value relatively low, say \( 0.2 \).

3. \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a Humanities professor:
   - We assume someone with these traits fits more with the humanities stereotypes.
   - Let’s assign this value relatively high, say \( 0.8 \).

4. \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description:
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   - Where \( P(\neg A) \), the probability Jason is not a CS professor is \( 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \).

   So,
   \[
   P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

So, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
