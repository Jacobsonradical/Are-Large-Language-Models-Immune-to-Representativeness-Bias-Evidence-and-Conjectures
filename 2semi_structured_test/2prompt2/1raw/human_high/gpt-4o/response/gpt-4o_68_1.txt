To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we want to calculate \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is 1 - \( P(\text{CS}) \), which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description being written for a computer science professor. Given that the description highlights creativity, emotional drive, and lack of technical traits, we might assume this is less likely for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor.

Similarly, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) would be the likelihood of the description being written for a humanities professor. Humanities professors are generally perceived to more closely fit the traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical).

Since we don't have exact numbers, we need to make an assumption about the relative likelihoods. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

Now we need to calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore:
