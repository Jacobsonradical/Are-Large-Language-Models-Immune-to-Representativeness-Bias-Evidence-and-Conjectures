To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be formally stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\(P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75\)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\(P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25\)).

First, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description for each group. Given Jasonâ€™s creatively driven and emotional profile, let's make an assumption based on typical stereotypes (statistical biases might occur, but we need a base to work with): humanities professors might have a higher probability of fitting this type of description than computer science professors.

We can assume:
- \( P(desc | CS) = 0.2 \) (20% of CS professors have a similar description).
- \( P(desc | H) = 0.8 \) (80% of humanities professors have a similar description).

Now, we calculate \( P(desc) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(desc) = P(desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(desc | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(desc) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(desc) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | desc) = \frac{P(desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(desc)} \]
\[ P(CS | desc) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | desc) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | desc) = 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
