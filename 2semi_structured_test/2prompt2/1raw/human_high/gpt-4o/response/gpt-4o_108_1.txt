To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to update the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the description given.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Firstly, we need to calculate \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods, \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \), which would be the probability of the description given the professor's field. Based on the description of Jason, it appears that he has traits more commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven). 

We can assume:
\[ P(B|CS) = \text{Low} \] 
\[ P(B|H) = \text{High} \]

However, without specific probabilities, let's say \( P(B|CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(B|H) = 0.8 \).

Finally, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
\[ {"probability": "0.43"} \]
