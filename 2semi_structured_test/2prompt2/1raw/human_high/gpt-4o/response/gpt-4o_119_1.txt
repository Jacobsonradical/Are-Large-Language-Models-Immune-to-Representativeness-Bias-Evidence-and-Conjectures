To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that someone chosen at random from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

First, let's define the probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
   This requires contextual interpretation. Given that technical skills are typically a key trait among computer science professors, and Jason is described as not particularly technical, it is reasonable to assume \( P(B|A) \) is low. Let’s more conservatively estimate it as \( 0.2 \).

4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.
   Jason’s traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) seem to fit better with common perceptions of humanities professors. So, let’s estimate this higher, say \( 0.8 \).

5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason’s description. This is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.43 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{{{"probability": "0.43"}}} \]
