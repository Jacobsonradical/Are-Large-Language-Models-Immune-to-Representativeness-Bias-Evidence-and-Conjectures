Based on the description provided, Jason's traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and having interests in traveling, reading, and exploring, combined with being described as not particularly technical, align more closely with common stereotypes associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

Since we need to update our prior probability with this information, let's work through the problem using Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's denote \( D \) as the description fitting a humanities professor.
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)): Let's assume this is low since his traits don't fit well with the stereotype, say 0.2.
   - Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)): Let's assume this is high, say 0.8.

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation (Bayes' Theorem):**

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) (total probability of the description) can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Then,

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
