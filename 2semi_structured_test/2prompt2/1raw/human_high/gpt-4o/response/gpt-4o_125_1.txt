In order to determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

We are given:
- The base rate of computer science professors in the sample is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The base rate of humanities professors in the sample is 25/100 = 0.25.

We need to determine the likelihood of observing the given description under each category:
1. P(description | computer science professor)
2. P(description | humanities professor)

The description of Jason indicates that he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical. This description would likely be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.

Suppose we assume:
- P(description | computer science professor) = 0.1 (as the description is less typical for computer science professors)
- P(description | humanities professor) = 0.7 (as the description is more typical for humanities professors)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(computer science professor | description) = \frac{P(description | computer science professor) \times P(computer science professor)}{P(description)} \]

Where:
\[ P(description) = (P(description | computer science professor) \times P(computer science professor)) + (P(description | humanities professor) \times P(humanities professor)) \]

So the calculations are:
\[ P(description) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Then:
\[ P(computer science professor | description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
