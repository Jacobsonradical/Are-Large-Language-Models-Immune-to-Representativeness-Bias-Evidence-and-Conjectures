To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to perform a Bayesian inference calculation. We will use Bayes' theorem, which helps update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a CS professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): Given the description of being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, it seems less likely to fit the stereotype of a computer science professor, who may often be perceived as more technical (though this is not a strict rule).
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \): The description seems to fit more closely with typical characteristics of professors in the humanities.

Without exact numerical data, we might estimate:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 0.8 \)

Total probability \( P(\text{Description}) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
