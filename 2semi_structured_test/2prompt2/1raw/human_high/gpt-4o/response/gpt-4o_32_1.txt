To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem. First, let's summarize the given information:

1. There are 100 professors in total.
2. 75 are computer science professors.
3. 25 are humanities professors.

Based on the prior probabilities:
- The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Humanities})\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we evaluate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\)) versus a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})\)).

Jason is described as:
- Creative and imaginative
- Emotionally driven
- Enjoys traveling, reading, exploring
- Gifted and passionate
- Not particularly technical

Based on these traits, it seems more probable that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Thus:
- \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\) is relatively low.
- \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities})\) is relatively high.

However, to assign exact numbers to these likelihoods is subjective without additional information. Let's assume the following reasonable approximations:
- \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \approx 0.1\)
- \(P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.8\)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find \(P(\text{CS}|\text{Description})\):

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \(P(\text{Description})\) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
\]

Then:

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.273"}
\]
