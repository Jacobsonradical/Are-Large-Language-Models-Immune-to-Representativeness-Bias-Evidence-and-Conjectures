To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

The prior probabilities are based on the sample proportions:
- Probability of choosing a computer science professor \( P(CS) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability of choosing a humanities professor \( P(H) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, let’s consider the likelihoods. Although we don't have concrete numbers about the likelihood of a description fitting either group, it’s reasonable to assume that a description mentioning creativity, emotional drive, lack of technical specifics, and interests like traveling and reading is more common among humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the probability of the description \( D \) given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the probability of the description \( D \) given a humanities professor.

Given the nature of the description, we assume \( P(D \mid H) > P(D \mid CS) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.7 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) (the overall probability of the description) is calculated by considering both groups:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.4 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \):
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.5625 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.5625"}
