To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- The proportion of computer science professors in the sample is 75 out of 100, so \( P(CS) = 0.75 \).
- The proportion of humanities professors in the sample is 25 out of 100, so \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), and the nature of the fields:
- Humanities professors might more commonly have these traits than computer science professors.

If we assign plausibility values based on common stereotypes or informed estimates:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.3 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.7 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.4 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.5625 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5625.
