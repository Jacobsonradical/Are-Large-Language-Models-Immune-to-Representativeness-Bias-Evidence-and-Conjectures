To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Given the problem, the hypotheses are:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We aim to calculate \( P(H_{CS} | E) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \), which is Jason's description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence under both hypotheses.

First, determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 100.
- Hence, \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- And \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, consider the likelihoods, \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{H}) \):
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which might better align with humanities professors as opposed to computer science professors.

Assuming:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \) (since it is less likely, but not impossible, for a computer science professor to fit this description).
- \( P(E | H_{H}) \approx 0.7 \) (since it is more likely for a humanities professor to fit this description).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
