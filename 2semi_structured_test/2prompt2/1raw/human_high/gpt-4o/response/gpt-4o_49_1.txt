First, we need to determine the prior probabilities of Jason being from either the computer science or humanities group. In the sample, there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

The prior probability (P) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability (P) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we examine the description of Jason and need to assess how likely this description would be for each of the groups. The description mentions Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, passionate, and not particularly technical. These traits seem to align more closely with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's denote:
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})\) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})\) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description fits more with common characteristics associated with humanities professors, we can set:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now, we substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.42857 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.43.
