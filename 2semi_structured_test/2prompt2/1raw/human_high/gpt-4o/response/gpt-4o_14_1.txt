To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let’s calculate each component:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   We need to make an educated guess based on the description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with a humanities professor.

   Let's assign:
   \[
   P(D|C) = 0.2
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

Finally, we apply these values to Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ 
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.
