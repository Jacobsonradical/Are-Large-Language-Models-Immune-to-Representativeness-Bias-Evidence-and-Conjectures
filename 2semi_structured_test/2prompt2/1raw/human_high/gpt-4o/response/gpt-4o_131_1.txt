To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines prior probabilities with likelihoods to update the posterior probability based on new evidence.

Let's define some terms:
- \( C \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( E \): the evidence given about Jason's description.

We need to calculate \( P(C|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes’ Theorem states:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|C) \): likelihood of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \): total probability of the evidence.

Firstly, determine \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the likelihoods \( P(E|C) \) and \( P(E|H) \). The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring—not particularly technical. These traits might be more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(E|C) \): the likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description, is relatively low, say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(E|H) \): the likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description, is relatively high, say \( 0.8 \).

Now, calculate the total probability of the evidence, \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability, \( P(C|E) \):

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|E) = 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
