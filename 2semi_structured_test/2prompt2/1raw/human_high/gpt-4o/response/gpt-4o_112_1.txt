To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason has the given description.

First, we need to determine:
- \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(B) \): the overall probability of someone fitting the description.

### Given:
1. 75 computer science professors.
2. 25 humanities professors.
3. Total: 100 professors.

Therefore, the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Let's assume:
- The description seems to fit a typical humanities professor more closely (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical).
- We assign a probability of fitting the description for humanities professors \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) = 0.8 \).
- For computer science professors, this description might be less common \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.2 \).

Now, to compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \times P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \times P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \times P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is roughly 0.43.
