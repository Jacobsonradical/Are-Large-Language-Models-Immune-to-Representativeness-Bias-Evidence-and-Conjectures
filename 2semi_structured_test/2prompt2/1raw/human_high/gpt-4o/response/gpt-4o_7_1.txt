To solve this problem, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us to update the probability of a hypothesis, given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether Jason is a computer science professor (H_C) or a humanities professor (H_H).

We are given prior probabilities based on the proportion of professors in each category:
- P(H_C) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H_H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (P(D|H_C)) and given he is a humanities professor (P(D|H_H)). 

From Jason's description:
- He is creative, imaginative, and often emotionally driven.
- He enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring.
- He is passionate, though not particularly technical.

These traits might be more stereotypically aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Thus, we can assume:
- P(D|H_H) > P(D|H_C)

However, without specific numerical likelihoods, an exact answer is challenging without more data. Despite this, we can make a reasonable assumption:
- Let’s assume P(D|H_H) = 0.8 (indicating high likelihood the description fits a humanities professor)
- Let’s assume P(D|H_C) = 0.2 (indicating lower but still possible likelihood for a computer science professor)

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

P(H_C|D) = [P(D|H_C) * P(H_C)] / [P(D|H_C) * P(H_C) + P(D|H_H) * P(H_H)]

Substitute the values:

= [0.2 * 0.75] / [0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25]
= [0.15] / [0.15 + 0.2]
= 0.15 / 0.35
= 0.4286 (approximately)

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.4286.

Here’s the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
