To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability we are looking for, that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, we need to determine the priors:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the 100 is a computer science professor (\( P(A) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\( P(\neg A) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Based on the given description:
- Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, not particularly technical) align more closely with common stereotypes of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that \( P(B|\neg A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A) \), but we need to quantify it.

Let’s make reasonable assumptions for these probabilities:
- Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \) (high likelihood given humanities traits)
- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given computer science traits)

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \) (the total probability of Jason's description):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2)(0.75) + (0.7)(0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.2)(0.75)}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{32.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) ≈ 0.462 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
\[ \text{{ "probability": "0.462" }} \]
