To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps to calculate it:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \).
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D | Hum) \).

   We do not have exact numerical values for these likelihoods, but we can make some educated assumptions based on the description:
   - Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate but not particularly technical. This description might suggest a higher likelihood for a humanities professor than a computer science professor, as computer science often requires technical skills and humanities are often associated with creative and imaginative traits.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), which can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

Since we don't have the exact values for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \), we can make qualitative assessments:

- **If \( P(D | CS) \) is much lower than \( P(D | Hum) \):** It indicates that the description is more likely to fit a humanities professor. Based on the description, this seems plausible.

Let's assume:
   - \( P(D | CS) \) could be conservatively around 0.2 because Jason is described as "not particularly technical".
   - \( P(D | Hum) \) could be conservatively around 0.8 because creative and imaginative traits fit more with humanities.

Then:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately:

\[
\{\text{"probability": "0.4286"}\}
\]
