To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description given the possible categories (computer science professor or humanities professor).

**Prior probabilities:**
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

**Likelihoods:**
Given the description of Jason, we need to assess how likely it is that such a description would correspond to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description suggests creativity, imagination, and an emotional drive, which are often more strongly associated with humanities. There's also a mention that he is "not particularly technical," further suggesting lower likelihood of him being in computer science.

While the exact likelihoods are not provided, we will make educated assumptions based on the description:
- Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) is relatively low, let’s estimate \(P(D|CS) \approx 0.2\).
- Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)) is relatively high, let’s estimate \(P(D|H) \approx 0.8\).

**Posterior probability:**
We use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
where \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description, given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

So,
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Then,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
