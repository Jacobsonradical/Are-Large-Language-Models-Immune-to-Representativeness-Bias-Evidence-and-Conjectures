To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Here is the required information for Bayes' theorem:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
  - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities)

- Likelihoods (informally assessed based on the description):
  - \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \): Probability that the given description matches a computer science professor. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits typically align more with humanities professors.
  - \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \): Probability that the given description matches a humanities professor. The description aligns well with common perceptions of humanities professors.

Given the description, let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Then:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
