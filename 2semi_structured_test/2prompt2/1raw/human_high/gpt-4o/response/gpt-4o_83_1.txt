To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we’ll use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the prior probability of an event, the likelihood of observed evidence given that event, and the probability of the evidence itself.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, we need to define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor. 
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a professor is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probability for a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability for a humanities professor, \( P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to assess:
- \( P(B | CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | H) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

From the description, Jason appears creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. These traits might be more commonly attributed to humanities professors. Therefore, 
- Suppose (subjectively estimated based on Jason’s traits) \( P(B | CS) = 0.2 \).
- Suppose \( P(B | H) = 0.8 \).

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \), which is the total probability of the description. This can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{(0.2) \cdot (0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, we can conclude:
