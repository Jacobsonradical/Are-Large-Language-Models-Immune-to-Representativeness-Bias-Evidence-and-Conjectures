To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's break down the information:

1. **Prior probabilities (base rates):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( 75 / 100 = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is \( 25 / 100 = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   Jason's description is notably creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and lacks technical skills. These traits are generally more associated with the humanities based on stereotypical attributes.
   - Let's denote the likelihood of this description for a computer science professor, \( P(Description | CS) \), as \( L_1 \).
   - Let’s denote the likelihood of this description for a humanities professor, \( P(Description | Hum) \), as \( L_2 \).

Given the description, it’s reasonable to infer that \( L_2 > L_1 \). For the purpose of this exercise, let's assign estimated likelihoods:
   - \( P(Description | CS) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.8 \)

3. **Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{ P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(Description) }
   \]

4. **Normalization factor** (\( P(Description) \)):
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

5. **Posterior probability:**
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{ 0.2 \cdot 0.75 }{ 0.35 } = \frac{ 0.15 }{ 0.35 } = \frac{ 15 }{ 35 } \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
