To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Based on the description, Jason seems more like a humanities professor as he is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technicalâ€”traits that are often associated with the humanities rather than computer science.

Assuming the likelihoods might look something like:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.9 \)

Now we can find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description \( B \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
