To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   This is where we need to assess how likely Jason's description fits the profile of each group. This is somewhat subjective, but based on the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, passionate but not particularly technical):
   - Given the description, it might be more likely he is a humanities professor due to traits like emotional and imaginative which are stereotypically less associated with computer science.
   
   Let's assume these likelihoods as:
   - Probability of Jason's description given he is a CS professor (\( P(Description|CS) \)) = 0.2 (since the description doesnâ€™t fit the typical technical stereotype of CS)
   - Probability of Jason's description given he is a Humanities professor (\( P(Description|Hum) \)) = 0.8

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where \( P(Description) \) is the normalizing constant and can be computed as:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
