To determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Jason's description.

We need to estimate the probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of being a computer science professor:
  \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability of being a humanities professor:
  \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given he's a computer science professor. Given the description emphasizes creativity, imagination, and emotionality while noting a lack of technicality, it's less likely to match the typical profile of a computer science professor. Let's assume a lower likelihood, for instance, 0.1.

- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given he's a humanities professor. The description aligns more closely with typical characteristics of humanities professors. Let's assume a higher likelihood, for instance, 0.7.

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.3"}} \]
