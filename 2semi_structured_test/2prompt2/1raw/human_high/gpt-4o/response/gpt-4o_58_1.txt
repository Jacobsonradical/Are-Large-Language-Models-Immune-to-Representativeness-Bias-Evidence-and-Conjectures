To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's define the probabilities with the given information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: 
   The probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science out of the 100 professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: 
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (25 out of 100):
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**:
   The probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description. Since the description fits more with the humanities profile, let's assume this probability is relatively low. For instance, we might say:
   \[ P(B | A) = 0.1 \]

4. **Complement Likelihood \( P(B | \neg A) \)**:
   The probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description. Considering the description fits the humanities profile well, this probability could be high, for example:
   \[ P(B | \neg A) = 0.7 \]

Now, we need \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Finally, applying these to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.3 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.3.
