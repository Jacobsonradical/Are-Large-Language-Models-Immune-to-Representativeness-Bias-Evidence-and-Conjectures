To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is well-suited to update the probability estimate for Jason being a computer science professor based on the given description.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
1. \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of someone randomly chosen being a computer science professor.
2. \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description \(D\) given that the person is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\).

First, we estimate the priors:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). The description provided fits more closely with common personality traits in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical). 

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \(P(D|C) = 0.1\) (since the traits are less likely to match a computer science professor)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) (since the traits are more characteristic of humanities professors)

Now, we calculate the total probability \(P(D)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
