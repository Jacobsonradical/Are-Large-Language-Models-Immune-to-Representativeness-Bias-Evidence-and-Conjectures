To solve this problem, we need to determine the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description.

Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

### Step 1: Determine Prior Probabilities
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. There are 75 CS professors out of 100 total professors.
  \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
  \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Determine Likelihoods
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor. Since Jason is described as not particularly technical, emotionally driven, and passionate, we might reason that this is less common in the computer science field, which is stereotypically more technical.
  Assume this likelihood is relatively low. For this calculation, let’s assume:
  \[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.1 \]

- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. The description matches more closely with typical stereotypes related to humanities professors.
  Assume this likelihood is relatively high. For this calculation, let’s assume:
  \[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.7 \]

### Step 3: Determine Normalizing Constant
- \( P(\text{Description}) \): The total probability of the description across all professors.
  \[
  P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25)
  \]
  \[
  P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate Posterior Probability
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ 
\text{{"probability": "0.3"}} 
\]
