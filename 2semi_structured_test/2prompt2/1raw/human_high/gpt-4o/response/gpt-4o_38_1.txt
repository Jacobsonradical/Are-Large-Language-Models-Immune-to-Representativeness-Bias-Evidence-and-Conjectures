To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We are trying to find P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | Description) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)): \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the likelihood of the description given each discipline. Given the creative and imaginative nature described, it appears more aligned with traits often found in humanities than in computer science. Thus, we might reasonably estimate:

- \( P(Description | CS) = 0.2 \) (assuming less likely for a CS professor)
- \( P(Description | H) = 0.8 \) (assuming more likely for a humanities professor)

The total probability of the description (\( P(Description) \)) is given by the law of total probability:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(Description) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.35 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.4286 \]

In conclusion, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
