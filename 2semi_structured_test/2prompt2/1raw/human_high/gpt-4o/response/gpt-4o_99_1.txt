To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, I will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen individual from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of having such a description.

First, let us define our events:
1. \( A \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
2. \( \neg A \): Jason is one of the humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).

From the description, Jason seems to fit more of a humanities profile, as he is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Therefore, we can make an educated guess that:

- \( P(B|A) \): the probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description is likely low. Let's estimate it to be around 0.1.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): the probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description is likely higher. Let's estimate it to be around 0.8.

Now, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of having such a description, using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.273.
