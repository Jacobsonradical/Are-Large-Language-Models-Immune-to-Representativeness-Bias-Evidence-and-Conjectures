To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We will denote the events as follows:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description fits Jason.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)).
- The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).

Since we don't have specific information about the likelihoods, we'll base our consideration on the fact that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. This description seems more aligned with typical traits of humanities professors than computer science professors.

For practical calculation, we'll denote:
- The likelihood of the description for computer science professors as \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming Jason's traits are less common among CS professors).
- The likelihood of the description for humanities professors as \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (assuming Jason's traits are more common among humanities professors).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
where,
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]
Now:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is around 0.4286.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
