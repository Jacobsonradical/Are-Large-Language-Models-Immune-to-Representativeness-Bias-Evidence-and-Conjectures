To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

Let's define the terms:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason fitting the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of Jason fitting the description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of Jason fitting the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (HU).
  
So:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{HU}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to match traits typically associated with humanities professors:
- Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, not particularly technical.
  
Assuming these traits are more common among humanities professors, we can make the following rough estimates:
- \( P(B|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\text{HU}) \approx 0.8 \)

Using these in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(B|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{HU}) \times P(\text{HU})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.4286"} \]

We round it to 4 decimal places:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.4286"\} \]
