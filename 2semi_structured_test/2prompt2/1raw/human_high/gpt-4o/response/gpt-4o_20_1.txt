To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be summarized as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of observing Jason's personality description.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, \( P(A_{CS}) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities, \( P(A_{H}) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(B|A_{CS}) \), and the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(B|A_{H}) \). Since this is subjective without explicit data, we must make an informed estimate. Jason's characteristics (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical) align more typically with humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's assume the likelihoods based on these qualitative descriptions as follows:
- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) (likelihood of the description given a computer science professor): 0.2
- \( P(B|A_{H}) \) (likelihood of the description given a humanities professor): 0.8

Finally, the total probability of observing Jason's description, \( P(B) \), can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
