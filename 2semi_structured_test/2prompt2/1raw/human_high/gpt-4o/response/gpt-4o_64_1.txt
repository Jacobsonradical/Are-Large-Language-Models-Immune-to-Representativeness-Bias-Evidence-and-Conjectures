To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Here, we'll denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's determine these probabilities:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we don't have explicit probabilities for \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we'll use our understanding of the description characteristics.

Given the description, Jason seems more typical of a humanities professor, as the description highlights creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and a lack of technical inclination, which are often more associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid C) \approx 0.2 \) (low since the description doesn't fit well with typical computer science professors).
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.8 \) (high since the description fits well with typical humanities professors).

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.75)}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
