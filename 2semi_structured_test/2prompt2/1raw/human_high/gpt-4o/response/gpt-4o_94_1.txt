To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors (100 professors total). So:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, based on Jason's description, it suggests he has traits that align more with the humanities than with computer science (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

For simplicity, let's estimate probabilities like this:
- Let's assume the probability of such a description for a humanities professor \( P(D | H) \) is higher, say 0.7.
- Let's assume the probability of such a description for a computer science professor \( P(D | CS) \) is lower, say 0.2.

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.2 \times 0.75 + 0.7 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4615 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4615.
