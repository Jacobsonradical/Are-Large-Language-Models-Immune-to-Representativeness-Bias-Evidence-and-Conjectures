To calculate the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The goal is to find \(P(CS | D)\), where \(CS\) stands for computer science professor and \(D\) is the given description of Jason.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability of picking a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability of picking a humanities professor: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's define \(P(D | CS)\) as the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Let's define \(P(D | H)\) as the probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," etc.), it aligns more closely with traits stereotypically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Although I don't have exact likelihood values, let's assume that:
   - \(P(D | CS)\) could be relatively low, let's denote it as 0.2.
   - \(P(D | H)\) could be relatively high, let's denote it as 0.8.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

So,
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Hence, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
