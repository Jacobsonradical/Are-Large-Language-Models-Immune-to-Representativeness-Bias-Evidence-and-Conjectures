To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We'll need to figure out each component of this formula:
1. \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
4. \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

### 1. Prior Probabilities
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### 2. Likelihoods
- \( P(D|C) \): Given the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, we might assume that such a description is less likely for computer science professors, who often have a reputation for technical and analytical skills. So let us assume \( P(D|C) \) to be a relatively low value, say 0.2.
- \( P(D|H) \): Given the description fits more with traits commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative), we might assign a higher likelihood for this group. Let's assume \( P(D|H) \) to be 0.8.

### 3. Total Probability \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

### Plugging into Bayes' Theorem
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, the desired posterior probability can be given as:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
