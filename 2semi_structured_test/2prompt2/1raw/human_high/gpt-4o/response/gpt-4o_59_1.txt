To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here is a step-by-step outline of the calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): \[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Humanities}) \)): \[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods*:
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \))
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \))

Considering that the description of Jason mentions he is imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Therefore, for the purpose of this calculation, let us assume the following heuristic likelihoods:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \)

3. **Total probability of the description (\( P(\text{Description}) \))**:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) * P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.1 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25 
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
   \]

4. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 * 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
   \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.273"}
