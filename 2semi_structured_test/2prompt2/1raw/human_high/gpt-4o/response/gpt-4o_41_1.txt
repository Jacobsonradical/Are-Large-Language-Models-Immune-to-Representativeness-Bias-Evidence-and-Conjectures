To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability based on new evidence.

First, let’s define our events:
- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Description matches Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.).

We need to find \(P(CS|D)\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate each part of this formula:
1. \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \(P(D|CS)\): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \(P(D)\): The total probability of the description, regardless of the field.

First, calculate the prior probability \(P(CS)\):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \(P(H)\):
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the likelihood of the description. We need an assumption here, as it’s not specified. Let’s assume \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) based on the description's alignment with typical traits.

Assume:
- The likelihood of a computer science professor being creative and imaginative (less technical): \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\)
- The likelihood of a humanities professor with such traits: \(P(D|H) = 0.6\)

Now, calculate \(P(D)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.6 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.15 = 0.225 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.225} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
