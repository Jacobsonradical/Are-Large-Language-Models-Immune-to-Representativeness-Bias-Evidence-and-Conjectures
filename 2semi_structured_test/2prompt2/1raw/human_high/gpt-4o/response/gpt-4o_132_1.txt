To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\neg A) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, consider the probability of Jason's description fitting a professor in each group. Given that his description matches a profile more aligned with humanities (creative, imaginative, not technical), we can make an educated but subjective guess on these probabilities:
- \( P(B|A) \) might be reasonably low. For estimation, assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) might be higher. For estimation, assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.4286"} \]
