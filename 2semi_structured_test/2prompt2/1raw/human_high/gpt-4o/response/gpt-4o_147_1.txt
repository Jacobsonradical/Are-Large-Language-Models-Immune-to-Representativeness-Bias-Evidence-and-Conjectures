To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:

1. We start with the prior probabilities:
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor (P(CS)) = number of CS professors / total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75.
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor (P(H)) = number of humanities professors / total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25.

2. Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods (P(description | CS) and P(description | H)). Based on the description of Jason, who is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical, it seems more representative of a humanities professor. Thus:
   - Let's assume P(description | H) = 0.9 (High likelihood based on the description fitting a humanities professor more closely).
   - Let's assume P(description | CS) = 0.1 (Low likelihood based on the description fitting a computer science professor less closely).

3. Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   Similarly, for the denominator:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

4. Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{(0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25)}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
   \]

5. Substituting this back into the formula:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
   \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
