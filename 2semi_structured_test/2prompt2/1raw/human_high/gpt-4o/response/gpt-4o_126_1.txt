To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps to calculate it:

1. **Determine Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods Based on Description**:
   - Let’s assume the likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description given (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical) is higher than that for a computer science professor. We need to assign reasonable likelihood values:
     - \( P(Description | Hum) \): Given the traits align more closely with humanities, let’s assume this likelihood is high, say 0.9.
     - \( P(Description | CS) \): Given these traits are less typical for computer science, let’s assume this likelihood is lower, say 0.3.

3. **Calculate Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(Description) = (0.3 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) = 0.225 + 0.225 = 0.45 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS | Description) \):

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.75}{0.45} = \frac{0.225}{0.45} = 0.5 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
