To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider both the base rates of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample, as well as how well Jason's description fits each category.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Based on Jason's description, we need to assess the likelihood that he fits the profile of a typical computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description suggests traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading, etc.) that are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors, who are often more technical.

To formally determine the posterior probability, we use Bayes' rule:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description, we can assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is low, say, around 0.1 because the description is more typical of a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) is high, say, around 0.9 because the description closely matches the profile of a humanities professor.

Now plug in these values:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
