Considering that:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving prior probabilities of P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75 and P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25.
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. These traits appear more stereotypically aligned with the humanities.

To use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) is the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(CS) \) and \( P(Hum) \) are the prior probabilities for computer science and humanities professors respectively.

If we assume that Jason's description is significantly more aligned with a humanities professor, let's assign \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D | Hum) = 0.8 \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
