To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's assign probabilities to each term.

1. **Prior Probability** \( P(A) \):

   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   
   \[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood** \( P(B|A) \):

   Based on the description, Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate but not technical. These traits are less typical of a computer science professor and more typical of a humanities professor. Let's assume a rough estimate for likelihoods:

   \[ P(B|A_{CS}) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(B|A_{H}) = 0.8 \]

3. **Total Probability** \( P(B) \):

   \[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
