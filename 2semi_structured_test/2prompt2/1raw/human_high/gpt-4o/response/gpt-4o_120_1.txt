To determine the likelihood that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason's description across all professors.

Firstly, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \) are:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, let’s consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) might be low since Jason’s profile does not fit the typical stereotype of a computer science professor (not particularly technical).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) might be high since Jason’s profile fits more with creative and imaginative traits often seen in humanities.

Assuming Jason’s description is more likely among humanities professors:

If we hypothesize values:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.2 \text{ (a guess based on the description being less typical for CS professors)} \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \text{ (a guess based on the description being more typical for humanities professors)} \]

We can calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.4286.
