To find the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description being observed given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing Jason's description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, given the description, we need to estimate the likelihoods:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \): Based on the description, Jason doesn't seem to exhibit traits commonly associated with the technical nature of computer science. Let’s assume that the proportion of computer science professors fitting this description is low, say \( 0.1 \).

- \( P(\text{description} | H) \): The description aligns more closely with typical humanities traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Let’s assume 0.9.

Now, compute the total probability of observing Jason's description \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | \text{description}) \):

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.25 \]

So the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.
