To determine the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

We'll need to calculate:
1. \( P(A) \): Probability that a random professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
3. \( P(B) \): Overall probability of Jason's description, regardless of discipline.

First, let's find \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's find \( P(\neg A) \):
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given Jason's description, we need to consider the stereotypical personality traits of each discipline. Jason is described as:
- Creative and imaginative
- Emotionally driven
- Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
- Gifted and passionate
- Not particularly technical

These traits seem to align more closely with humanities professors, but let's estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

For a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)):
- Let's reasonably estimate the probability, considering the given traits are not strongly technical: 
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \]

For a humanities professor (\( P(B|\neg A) \)):
- Given the alignment of Jason's traits with creative and emotionally driven characteristics:
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.8 \]

Now calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
