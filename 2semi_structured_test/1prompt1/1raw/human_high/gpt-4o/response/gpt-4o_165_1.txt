To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This will take into account both the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor and the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

### Prior Probabilities

First, we determine the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- Probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Probability of being a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

### Likelihood

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the given description fitting each type of professor:
- Let P(D|CS) be the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- Let P(D|H) be the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it is reasonable to estimate that this description is more likely for a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

For the purpose of this calculation, suppose:
- P(D|CS) is relatively low: say 0.2 (since the description doesn't closely match the typical profile of a computer science professor).
- P(D|H) is relatively high: say 0.8 (since the description closely matches the typical profile of a humanities professor).

### Posterior Probability

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, we compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:
