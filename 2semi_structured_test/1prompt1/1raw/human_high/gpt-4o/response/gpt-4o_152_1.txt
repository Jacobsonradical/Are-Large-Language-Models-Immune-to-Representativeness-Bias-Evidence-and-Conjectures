To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\(CS\)) \( N_{CS} = 75 \)
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)) \( N_H = 25 \)

Total number of professors: \( N = N_{CS} + N_H = 100 \)

From Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS | D)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description \(D\) given that the professor is in computer science.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability of the professor being in computer science.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\).

Let's start by approximating:

1. The prior probability \(P(CS)\):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{N_{CS}}{N} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. The prior probability \(P(H)\):
\[ P(H) = \frac{N_H}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. If we assume \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\) are roughly similar because the description provided does not strongly favor one discipline over the other, we can assume \(P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H)\).

Given the ratio of computer science to humanities professors in the sample, the simplest model without additional information would be to maintain their proportional representation:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \(P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H)\):

\[ P(D) \approx P(D | CS) \]

Then:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \approx \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | CS)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:
