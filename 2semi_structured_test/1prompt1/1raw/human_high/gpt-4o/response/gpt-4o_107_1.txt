To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step process to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

First, let’s set up our notation:

- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a person is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the given description if the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the given description if the person is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the given description.

From the problem, we know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which in this case is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

However, without specific values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can use a reasonable assumption for simplification.

Given the description, Jason appears more aligned with common traits found in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). Let us assume the following about the probabilities based on the description:

Suppose:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now we calculate \( P(D) \) assuming these probabilities:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
