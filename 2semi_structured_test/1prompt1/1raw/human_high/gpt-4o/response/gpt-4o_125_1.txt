To solve for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood that a computer science professor matches the description (\( P(D | CS) \)), and the likelihood that a humanities professor matches the description (\( P(D | H) \)).

Given the description mentions Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical," it seems more aligned with common stereotypes of humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Assume:
   - Likelihood that a computer science professor matches the description (\( P(D | CS) \)) might be relatively low: lets assume it to be 0.2.
   - Likelihood that a humanities professor matches the description (\( P(D | H) \)) might be relatively high: lets assume it to be 0.8.

3. **Total probability of the description (normalizing constant):**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Posterior probability (Bayes' Theorem application):**
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.4286.

So, the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
```
