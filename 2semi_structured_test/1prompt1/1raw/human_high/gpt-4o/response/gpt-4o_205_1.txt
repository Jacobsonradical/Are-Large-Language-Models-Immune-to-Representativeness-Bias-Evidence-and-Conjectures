To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of having the description provided.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \):**
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   - This is the probability of having the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Since we do not have the specific likelihood values, let's assume the description fits both groups fairly. However, we should lean on the qualitative nature of the description:
     - Creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical â€” these traits might fit a humanities professor better than a computer science professor.
     - If we are to use a rough estimate, let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) for computer science professors.

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \):**
   - This is the probability of having the described traits if Jason is a humanities professor.
   - In the absence of specific data, we give this a higher likelihood, say \( P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   - This is the combined probability of getting the described traits within the total sample.
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.15) + (0.2) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.35 \).

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   - Applying Bayes' Theorem:
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \)
   - \( P(A|B) \approx 0.429 \).

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.429.
