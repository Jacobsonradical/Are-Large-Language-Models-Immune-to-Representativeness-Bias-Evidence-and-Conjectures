To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in the context of this problem can be formulated as:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We start with the priors:
- The probability that someone is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- The probability that someone is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{H})\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Given the description provided, it seems more likely to match the characteristics commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors. However, for a precise calculation, we need to consider subjective assessments of how likely this description fits each group. Assuming we estimate that the description is twice as likely to fit a humanities professor as a computer science professor:

- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is a certain subjective probability.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \) is twice \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \).

Since the total probability must sum to 1, we can use normalization using Bayes' theorem for combining these conditional probabilities appropriately.

Let \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = k \).
Then \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) = 2k \).

So the total probability \( P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot 0.75 + 2k \cdot 0.25 = 0.75k + 0.5k = 1.25k \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{1.25k} = \frac{0.75}{1.25} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
