To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Total number of professors = 100 (75 in computer science, 25 in humanities)
- Jason's description: creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which is \( P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)

Given the description provided, it is more characteristic of humanities professors. Consequently, we will assume:
- \( P(D|CS) < P(D|H) \)
- For illustration, assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (this ratio reflects our assumption that the description is 9 times more likely for humanities professors)

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we can compute \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}} \]
