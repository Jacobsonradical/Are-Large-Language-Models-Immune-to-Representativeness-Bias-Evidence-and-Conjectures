To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this problem,
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description that we have for Jason.

First, we need to determine these individual probabilities:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \) and \( P(A^c) \)**:
   - \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
   - \( P(A^c) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.

Given: There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
   - \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Without specific details regarding the likelihoods, let's make some assumptions based on the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical. These traits suggest he might be less likely to be a computer science professor and more likely to be a humanities professor.
  
For simplicity, but fairly conservatively:
- Assume these descriptive traits are 30% (0.3) likely for a computer science professor.
- Assume these descriptive traits are 80% (0.8) likely for a humanities professor.

3. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)**:
Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description, we use:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.425 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.425} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.425} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.529 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is approximately 0.529.
