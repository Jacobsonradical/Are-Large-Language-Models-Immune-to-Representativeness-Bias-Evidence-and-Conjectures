To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's define the events:
- \(A_1\) as Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(A_2\) as Jason being a humanities professor.

From the problem, we know:
- \(P(A_1) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (since 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science).
- \(P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (since 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities).

Next, we need to estimate \(P(B|A_1)\) and \(P(B|A_2)\):
- \(P(B|A_1)\): The probability that a computer science professor has Jason's description. Given that Jason's description includes creative and imaginative traits and less emphasis on technical skills, it's plausible that these traits are less common in computer science compared to humanities. So let's assume a lower probability such as 0.2.
- \(P(B|A_2)\): The probability that a humanities professor has Jason's description. Since creative and imaginative traits are likely more common in humanities, let's assume a higher probability such as 0.8.

Now we can compute \(P(B)\) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
