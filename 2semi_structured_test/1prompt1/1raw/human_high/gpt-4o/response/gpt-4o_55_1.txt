First, let's use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving the description provided.

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \))**:
   The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (\( P(\text{Humanities}) \))**:
   The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \))**:
   To calculate the likelihood is more complex since we need to assess how likely a computer science professor has characteristics described in Jason's profile. However, based on the provided description which emphasizes being not particularly technical and being creative and imaginative, it's more likely among humanities professors. For illustration purposes, let's assume the following likelihoods:

   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \, \text{(assuming 20% likelihood)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.7 \, \text{(assuming 70% likelihood)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \))**:
   The total probability of the description happening:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability (\( P(A|B) \))**:
   Finally, we can compute the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \approx 0.4615
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4615.
