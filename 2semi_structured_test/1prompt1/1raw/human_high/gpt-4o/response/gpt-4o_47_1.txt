To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability**: The basis probability of choosing a professor from each field. We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS}) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Humanities}) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the description given that the professor is in a specific field. Let's evaluate the probabilities based on the description of Jason:
   
   - "Creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" suggests someone in the humanities, but it's not exclusive to humanities.
   - "Not particularly technical" further leans away from computer science.

Given this description, let's make some heuristic estimates for simplicity:
   
   - Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \)): Let's assume this to be low, say 0.2, because the description fits less with technical fields.
   - Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{Desc} | \text{Humanities}) \)): Let's assume this to be higher, say 0.8, because the description fits better with the humanities.

3. **Posterior Probability**: Use Bayes' theorem to combine these:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Desc})}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(\text{Desc}) \) which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{Desc}) = P(\text{Desc} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Desc} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Plugging in our values:

\[
P(\text{Desc}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, compute \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) \):

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Desc}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.4286"}}
\]
