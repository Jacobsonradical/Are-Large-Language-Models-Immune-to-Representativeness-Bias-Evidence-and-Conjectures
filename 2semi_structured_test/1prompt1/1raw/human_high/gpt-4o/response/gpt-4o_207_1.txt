To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem lets us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) for being a computer science professor
- \( H \) for being a humanities professor
- \( D \) for matching the description given (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring, not technical)

We want to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of the description given one is a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \).
   - The likelihood of the description given one is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \).

Since we don't have explicit data on how often computer science and humanities professors match this description, we'll assume that the description is more likely to match a humanities professor based on its content (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical), but we don't know the exact probabilities. Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) = 0.05, which is our estimate of the likelihood of a computer science professor matching this description (not very high).
- \( P(D | H) \) = 0.5, which is our estimate of the likelihood of a humanities professor matching this description (higher because it fits the humanities profile better).

3. **Marginal Probability:**
\[ 
P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H) 
\]
\[ 
P(D) = (0.05 \times 0.75) + (0.5 \times 0.25) 
\]
\[ 
P(D) = 0.0375 + 0.125 = 0.1625 
\]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.75}{0.1625} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.0375}{0.1625} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS | D) \approx 0.231 
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.231, or 23.1%.
