To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we'll calculate these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complement of Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**:
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)**:
   - This is what we need to estimate based on the description. Jason's description fits more with the traits associated with humanities rather than technical, logical traits typically associated with computer science. Let's assume a very small likelihood for humanities and a smaller number for computer science.

   Suppose, for simplicity: 
   - \( P(B | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \).
   - \( P(B | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \).

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - This is the weighted sum of the individual likelihoods:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B | \text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(B | \text{Humanities})P(\text{Humanities})
   \] 
   \[
   P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
   \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | \text{CS})P(\text{CS})}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.25.

So, the final answer is:
```
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
