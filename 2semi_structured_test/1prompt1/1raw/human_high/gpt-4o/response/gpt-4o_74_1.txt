To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior probability calculation**:
    - Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
    - Number of humanities professors (H): 25
    - Total number of professors: 100

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood calculation**:
To compute the likelihood, we need to consider the personality traits described and their likelihood in both groups. Based on the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical.

Assuming based on general stereotypes and known information:
- Humanities professors are generally more likely to fit this description compared to computer science professors.
- Let’s estimate the likelihood of such a description among humanities professors (\(P(D|H)\)) and among computer science professors (\(P(D|CS)\)) could be approximated (for simplicity, we’ll use assumed values based on common traits):
    - \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) (90%)
    - \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\) (20%)

3. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Where \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description, is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.225 = 0.375 \]

Now plug \(P(D)\) into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is given by:
