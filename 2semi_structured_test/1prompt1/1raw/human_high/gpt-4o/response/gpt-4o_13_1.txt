To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will employ Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

We are to find the probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \), i.e., the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To proceed, we would typically need the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \). 

Given the description of Jason as emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, these traits might be less common among computer science professors than among humanities professors. Let's assign subjective probabilities based on this description:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) = 0.4 \)

Now, we can find \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.4 \times 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.075 + 0.1 \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.175 \]

Finally, plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.175} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.175} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{75}{175} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
