To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote the different groups and probabilities:
1. Let \( P(CS) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. Let \( P(H) \) be the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
3. Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
4. Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.
5. Let \( P(D) \) be the probability of the description fitting any professor, regardless of their field.

From the problem statement:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given the description of Jason, which seems to be more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we would reasonably estimate:

\[
P(D|CS) \text{ (Lower probability due to less alignment with technical traits)} = x
\]
\[
P(D|H) \text{ (Higher probability due to more alignment with humanities traits)} = y
\]

Given that \( P(D|H) \) is higher and \( P(D|CS) \) is lower, but without exact numerical probabilities for these likelihoods, we might set a reasonable ratio. For instance:
\[
P(D|CS) = 0.2
\]
\[
P(D|H) = 0.8
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{15}{35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
\boxed{ {"probability": "0.4286"} }
\]
