To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( |C| \)) = 75
- The number of humanities professors (\( |H| \)) = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to find the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor \( P(C) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor \( P(H) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25

Now, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(description | C) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(description | H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description suggests he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it fits the stereotypical profile of a humanities professor more closely than a computer science professor. For this reason, we assume:

- \( P(description | C) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(description | H) \) is relatively high.

Let's assign some plausible values for these likelihoods:
- \( P(description | C) \) = 0.1 (10% chance a computer science professor fits this description)
- \( P(description | H) \) = 0.8 (80% chance a humanities professor fits this description)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C | description) = \frac{P(description | C) \times P(C)}{P(description)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(description) = P(description | C) \times P(C) + P(description | H) \times P(H)
\]

Calculating \( P(description) \):
\[
P(description) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
\]

Now calculate \( P(C | description) \):
\[
P(C | description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.273.
