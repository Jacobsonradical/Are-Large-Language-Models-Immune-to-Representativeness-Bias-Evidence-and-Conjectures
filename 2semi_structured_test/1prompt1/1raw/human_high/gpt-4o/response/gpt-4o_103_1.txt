To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event as more information becomes available.

We need to calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

We have the following data from the study:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Given that Jason seems to have traits that are more commonly associated with humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we can assume these traits are more likely in humanities professors.

Let's assume these probabilities for the sake of calculation:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.2 \) (Since the description fits less well with typical computer science professors)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.8 \) (Since the description fits well with typical humanities professors)

The overall probability \( P(D) \) can be calculated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
