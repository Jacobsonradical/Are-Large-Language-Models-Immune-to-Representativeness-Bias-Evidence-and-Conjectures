To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description provided, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The steps are as follows:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \(D\): Description matches Jason.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \(P(C)\), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities, \(P(H)\), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \(P(D|C)\): Probability that the description matches a computer science professor. Without additional specific data on how descriptions match up with each discipline, we must make an assumption. Let's assume (subjectively) \(P(D|C) = 0.2\), indicating it is less likely given the less technical qualities mentioned.
   - \(P(D|H)\): Probability that the description matches a humanities professor. Letâ€™s assume (subjectively) \(P(D|H) = 0.8\), given it fits with humanities more naturally.

4. **Total probability of the description \(D\):**
   - \(P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)\)
   - Substituting the values: \(P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)\)
   - \(P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35\)

5. **Posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - \(P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)}\)
   - Substituting the values: \(P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35}\)
   - \(P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}\)
   - \(P(C|D) \approx 0.4286\)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.
