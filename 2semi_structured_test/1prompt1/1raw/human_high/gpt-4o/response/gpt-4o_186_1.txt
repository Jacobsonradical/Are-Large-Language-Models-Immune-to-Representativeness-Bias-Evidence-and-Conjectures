To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS professors), we need to use Bayes' theorem, which in its simplest form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors: 
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we consider the likelihoods, \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A')\):
- We assume the description fits professors in the humanities better than those in computer science.
  - Suppose we estimate:
    - \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (a small chance that a CS professor matches the description)
    - \( P(B|A') = 0.8 \) (a high chance that a humanities professor matches the description)

Finally, we calculate the total probability \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275 \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(A|B)\):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
