To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the necessary probabilities.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \(P(CS)\):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \(P(Hum)\):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood of the evidence given each category:**
   - \(P(E | CS)\): The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
   - \(P(E | Hum)\): The probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Since we do not have specific probabilities about each likelihood and relying on general tendencies that humanities professors are more likely to be described as "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical," we could hypothesize that:

   - \(P(E | CS)\) is relatively low because the traits described do not match the stereotype of a computer science professor.
   - \(P(E | Hum)\) is relatively high because the traits described fit more closely with the stereotype of a humanities professor.

If we estimate these probabilities qualitatively,
- Let's assume \(P(E | CS) = 0.2\)
- Let's assume \(P(E | Hum) = 0.8\)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
\]

where \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence and can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, we calculate \(P(CS | E)\):

\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS | E) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
