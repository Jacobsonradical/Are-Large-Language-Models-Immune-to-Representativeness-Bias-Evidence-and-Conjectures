To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the evidence described about Jason.

We are asked to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to estimate the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description B given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description B.

Given the sample size:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors is 100.

Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability of being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, to apply Bayes' theorem, we need an estimate of \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), where \( \neg A \) denotes the event that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor).

Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, but not technical), it appears to align more closely with the general stereotype of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. We assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.9 \)

We compute \( P(B) \) as follows:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
