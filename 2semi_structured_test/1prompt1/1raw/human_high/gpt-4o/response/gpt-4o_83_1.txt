To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. We need the following components:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability that the description matches a profile given they are a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability that the description matches a profile given they are a humanities professor.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors among the 100 total professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, consider the descriptions. Given the information about Jason being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, it seems this description matches more closely with the typical humanities professor, but probabilities are needed.

This scenario can be further understood with simplifications:
- Let’s assume \( P(D|CS) \): Given a computer science professor, the probability of matching Jason's description is relatively low, let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \).
- Let’s assume \( P(D|H) \): Given a humanities professor, the probability of matching Jason's description is relatively high, let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \).

Now we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

Finally, compute \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.3 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.3 \).
