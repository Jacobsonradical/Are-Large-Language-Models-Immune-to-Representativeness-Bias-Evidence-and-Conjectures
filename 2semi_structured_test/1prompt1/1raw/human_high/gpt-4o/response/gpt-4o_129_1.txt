To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the prior probability of Jason's description.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors).

Next, we need the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). These represent how likely Jasonâ€™s description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given Jason's description, he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical, enjoys traveling, and reading. These traits may be more closely aligned typically with a humanities professor.

Lets assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \)

It's important to note that these likelihoods are subjective and based on common stereotypes.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
