To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem, which is articulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason’s description among all professors.

First, let's define our events:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: Jason has the given description.

We know:
- \( P(A) = \frac{\text{number of CS professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Given Jason's description, it seems more typical of a humanities professor who is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Although it's challenging to exactly quantify these probabilities, we might reasonably hypothesize that \( P(B|A) \) would be lower due to the lack of technical characteristics. Assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \)

Now, we need to compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Final answer:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
