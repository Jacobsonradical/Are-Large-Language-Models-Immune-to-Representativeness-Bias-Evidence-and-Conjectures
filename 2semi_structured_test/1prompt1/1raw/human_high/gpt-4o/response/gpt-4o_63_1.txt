To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, compute the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let's consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(D \mid C) \): The probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description is more typical for someone in the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it is reasonable to hypothesize that:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is lower.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is higher.

However, without exact numerical values, we simplify the problem by considering these as proportional.

For simplicity, assume \( P(D \mid C) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D \mid H) = 0.8 \)â€” these are arbitrary values reflecting the qualitative assessment.

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.42857 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
