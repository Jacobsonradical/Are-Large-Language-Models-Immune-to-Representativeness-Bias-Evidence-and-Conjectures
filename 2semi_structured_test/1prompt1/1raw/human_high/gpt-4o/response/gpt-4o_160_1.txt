To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) is the information in Jason's description.

Here's the sequence of the computation:

1. **Prior probabilities (base rates):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor ( \( P(\text{CS}) \) ): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor ( \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) ): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)): This is not directly provided, but for simplicity, let's assume that the characteristics described are more likely to be found in humanities professors based on the context of the description.

   - Let's assume that:
     - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.3 \)
     - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.7 \)

3. **Total probability of Jason's description ( \( P(\text{Description}) \) ):**
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.175 = 0.4 \]

4. **Posterior probability (using Bayes' theorem):**
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = 0.5625 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.5625.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.5625"}
