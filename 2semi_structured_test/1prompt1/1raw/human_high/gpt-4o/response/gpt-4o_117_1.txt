To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) as the event corresponding to Jason's description.

We are interested in \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Firstly, calculate the prior probabilities \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Then we need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). This involves making subjective estimates based on Jason's description and the typical characteristics of computer science versus humanities professors. Based on the description, which emphasizes creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and non-technical nature:

- It seems more aligned with the typical traits of a humanities professor, so let's assume \(P(D|H) = 0.8\).
- Conversely, the probability that a computer science professor has such traits might be lower, say \(P(D|C) = 0.2\).

Now compute \(P(D)\), the total probability of Jason's description, using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to compute \(P(C|D)\):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.4286"}\} \]
