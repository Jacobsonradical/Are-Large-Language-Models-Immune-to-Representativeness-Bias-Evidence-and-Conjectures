To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Define the events as follows:
- Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) represent the description given.

We need to find the probability \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate each term:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
  \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we do not have specific data on the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we will assume these probabilities based on the description to be more suitable for a humanities professor due to traits like creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, which might be less common in computer science professors. Let's assign the following estimates for simplicity:
  \[ P(D|C) = 0.1 \]
  \[ P(D|H) = 0.9 \]

- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
  \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
  \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
  \[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
  \[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
