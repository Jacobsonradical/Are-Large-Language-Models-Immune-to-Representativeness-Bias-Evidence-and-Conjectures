To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which involves considering both the base rates of computer science and humanities professors as well as the likelihood of certain descriptions fitting into each category.

### Step-by-step application of Bayes' theorem:

1. **Identify base rates (priors):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors (C).
   - There are 25 humanities professors (H).
   - Probability that a professor is from computer science: \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a professor is from humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Estimate the likelihood of the description:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of a professor fitting Jason's description if they are from computer science or humanities.

However, since we do not have explicit probabilities for the descriptions, we can only make a heuristic guess based on the information we have.

Let's assume that Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) fits more commonly with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Let's hypothesize that:
   - Probability of fitting the description given computer science: \(P(D|C) = 0.1\) (somewhat rare for computer science professors).
   - Probability of fitting the description given humanities: \(P(D|H) = 0.8\) (more common for humanities professors).

3. **Apply Bayes’ theorem:**
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275
   \]

   Now compute \(P(C|D)\):
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.273.

### Final answer:
{\ "probability": "0.273"}
