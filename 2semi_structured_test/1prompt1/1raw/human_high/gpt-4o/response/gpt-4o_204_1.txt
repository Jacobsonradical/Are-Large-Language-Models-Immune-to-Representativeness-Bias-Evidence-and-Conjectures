To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. We want to find \( P(CS | D) \), where \( CS \) represents being a computer science professor and \( D \) represents the description given.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to consider each part of this formula:

1. **\( P(CS) \)**: The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
2. **\( P(D | CS) \)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. **\( P(D) \)**: The overall probability of Jason fitting the description, considering both groups of professors.

Let's begin with \( P(CS) \). Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need \( P(H) \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are difficult to estimate precisely without more data, but we can make an informed guess based on the description:

- Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," which aligns more typically with stereotypes associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.
- Jason is "not particularly technical," which might further suggest he aligns more with humanities.

Given these characteristics, let's estimate:

\[ P(D | CS) = 0.2 \] (or some other low probability)

\[ P(D | H) = 0.8 \] (or some higher probability)

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{15}{35} \]

\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
