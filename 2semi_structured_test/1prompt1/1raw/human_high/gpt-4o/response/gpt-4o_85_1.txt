To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

The prior probabilities of being a computer science professor or a humanities professor are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely it is for someone with Jason's description to be in either category. Although we do not have precise likelihoods, we can reason intuitively based on the description given:

- Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," which are traits more commonly associated with humanities professors.
- He is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," which also suggests a higher likelihood of being in the humanities.

Because these traits seem to align more with the humanities than computer science, we will assume that the likelihood of this description given a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)) is higher than the likelihood of this description given a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)).

Assuming subjective likelihoods, let's say:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (Jason's description given he is a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (Jason's description given he is a humanities professor)

We can now use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
\]

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Therefore, the answer is:

\{"probability": "0.4286"\}
