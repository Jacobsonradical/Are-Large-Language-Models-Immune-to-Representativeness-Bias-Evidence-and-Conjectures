To compute this probability, we need to consider how likely it is that someone with Jason's described traits comes from either the computer science group or the humanities group. To simplify, Bayes' Theorem can be applied.

We know the following:
- \( P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider how likely a person with Jason's description would be from each group, assuming that creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of a technical focus are potentially more common in humanities professors than computer science professors.

Letâ€™s denote:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS Professor}) = p_{cs} \)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities Professor}) = p_{hum} \)

While exact numbers for \( p_{cs} \) and \( p_{hum} \) are not given, typical assumptions consistent with stereotypes might suggest:
- \( p_{cs} \) is low because Jason is described as not particularly technical.
- \( p_{hum} \) is higher because the description matches typical humanities traits.

If we qualitatively assume \( p_{cs} = 0.2 \) and \( p_{hum} = 0.8 \), then by Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is a normalizing factor and can be computed from the total contributions:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Professor}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Professor}) \]

Thus:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
