To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample, we should apply Bayes' Theorem. We'll identify the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need the probability that a professor in computer science fits Jason's description, \( P(D|CS) \)
   - We need the probability that a professor in the humanities fits Jason's description, \( P(D|H) \)

Since the problem does not provide explicit likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we have to rely on reasonable assumptions about the given descriptions:
   
Assumptions:
- Professors in humanities are generally more likely to be described as "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical".
- Professors in computer science are less likely to fit this description.

Without specific numbers, let's model it as:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (since the traits are less common in computer science based on typical stereotypes)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \) (since the traits are more common in the humanities based on typical stereotypes)

3. **Total Probability of Description**:
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \)

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \)

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description is:
