To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem involves updating our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
    - The probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - The likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
    - The likelihood \( P(D|H) \) that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

Since we are only presented with one description and no concrete data about how likely the traits are for each group, we can hypothesize based on the description:
- Jason is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and "not particularly technical". These traits might be considered more typical of humanities professors than computer science professors.

For simplicity, let's assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively low, say 0.1.
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively high, say 0.9.

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.1 \times 0.75 + 0.9 \times 0.25}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.225} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
