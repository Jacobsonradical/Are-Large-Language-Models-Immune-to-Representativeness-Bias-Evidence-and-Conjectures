To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science (CS) professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a CS professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Now, let:
- \(A\) be the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \(B\) be the event of Jason's description.

Firstly, we'll determine \(P(A)\):
- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \(P(A)\) (i.e., the probability of selecting a CS professor from the sample) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we'll determine \(P(\neg A)\):
- \(P(\neg A)\) (i.e., the probability of selecting a humanities professor from the sample) is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\). Estimating these probabilities requires assumptions based on the given description which seems more aligned with a humanities professor due to characteristics such as being emotionally driven, imaginative, and not particularly technical. Therefore, let:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.2 \]
and
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \]

To find \(P(B)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
