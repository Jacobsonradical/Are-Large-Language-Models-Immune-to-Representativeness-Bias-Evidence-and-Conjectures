To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how:

1. Let's denote:
    - \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
    - \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
    - \( D \) as the event that Jason fits the given description.

2. We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{ P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D) } \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups.

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider the descriptions:
- The description suggests qualities that are more typical of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

For the sake of this exercise, let's make a reasonable assumption:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (low probability because the description is less typical for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (higher probability because the description is more typical for a humanities professor)

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
\[ \mathbf{{"probability": "0.4286"}} \]
