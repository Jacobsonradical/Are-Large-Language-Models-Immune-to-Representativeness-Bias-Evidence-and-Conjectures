To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can go through the problem systematically:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability of picking a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): Probability of picking a humanities professor.

   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We need to assess the likelihood of the personality description for each group. (Though the description is more stereotypically aligned with humanities, let's assume no different likelihoods for simplicity.)
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) \): Probability of the description given the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \): Probability of the description given the professor is from humanities.

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]

   The marginal probability \( P(D) \) is:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
  
   Assuming Jason's description fits equally likely in both groups:
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 1 \) (for simplicity)

   Thus:
   \[
   P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1
   \]

   Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}
\]
