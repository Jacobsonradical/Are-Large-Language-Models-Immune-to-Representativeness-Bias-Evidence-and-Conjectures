To compute this probability, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(HU) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|HU) \) = Probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor

Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to account for the description given. The description seems to fit better with a humanities professor than with a computer science professor. However, we don't have exact numbers for these probabilities. For simplicity, let's assume that the description is twice as likely to fit a humanities professor as a computer science professor. 

Thus,
\[ P(D|CS) = x \]
\[ P(D|HU) = 2x \]

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), which is given by Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + 2x \cdot 0.25 = 0.75x + 0.5x = 1.25x \]

Now, we substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{1.25x} = \frac{0.75}{1.25} = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.6"} \]
