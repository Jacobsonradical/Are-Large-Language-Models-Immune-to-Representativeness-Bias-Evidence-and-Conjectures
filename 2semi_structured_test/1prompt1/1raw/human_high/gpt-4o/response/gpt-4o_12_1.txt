To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us compute the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

First, let's establish the basic probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)) is \(75/100 = 0.75\).
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(25/100 = 0.25\).

Now, we need to consider the description of Jason and estimate the likelihood of such a profile belonging to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor based on the provided description. 

Given that Jason is emotionally driven, imaginative, and not particularly technical, these traits might more commonly associate with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, without specific data on the distribution of such traits in each group, we can make an assumption based on logical propensity:
- Let's assume the probability of a computer science professor having this profile (\(P(Profile|CS)\)) could be reasonably low, say 0.1.
- Similarly, let's assume the probability of a humanities professor having this profile (\(P(Profile|Hum)\)) could be much higher, say 0.8.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|Profile) = \frac{P(Profile|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Profile)} \]

Where \(P(Profile)\) is the total probability of observing the profile, calculated as:
\[ P(Profile) = P(Profile|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Profile|Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Profile) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(Profile) = 0.075 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(Profile) = 0.275 \]

Now, we substitute back to find \( P(CS|Profile) \):
\[ P(CS|Profile) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|Profile) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|Profile) \approx 0.273 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.273.
