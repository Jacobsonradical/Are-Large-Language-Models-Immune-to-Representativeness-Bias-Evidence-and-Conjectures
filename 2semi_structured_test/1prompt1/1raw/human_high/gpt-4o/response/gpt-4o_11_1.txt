To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Let's assume that the description \( D \) fits equally well to both groups (which might simplify our calculation since specific estimations of \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are challenging without more detailed information).

So, \( P(C) \) is:

\[
P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

And \( P(H) \) is:

\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

If we assume that the description, creatively, fits computer science professors equally as it does humanities professors:

\[
P(D|C) = P(D|H)
\]

Thus,

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can denote this common conditional probability by \( P(D|X) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|X) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|X) \cdot 1
\]

Therefore, 

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|X) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|X)} = 0.75
\]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{0.75}
\]
