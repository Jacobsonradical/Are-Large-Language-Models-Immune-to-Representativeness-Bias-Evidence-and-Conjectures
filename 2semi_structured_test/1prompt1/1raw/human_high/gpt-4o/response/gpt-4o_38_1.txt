To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:

- \( C \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description that was given about Jason.

We need to determine:
\[ P(C|D) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- There are 100 professors in total: 75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Similarly, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate the probabilities \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). However, without precise data, we have to use reasonable assumptions based on the description. The description suggests traits more common in humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

Let's assume the following:
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (it's quite likely that a humanities professor would fit this description).
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (it's less likely, but still possible, for a computer science professor to fit this description).

Now, let's calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can find \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
