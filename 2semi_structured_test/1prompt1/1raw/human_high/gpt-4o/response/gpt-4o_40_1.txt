To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for calculating conditional probabilities. The steps are as follows:

1. **Define the Events**:
   - \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): Jason fits the given description.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
   - \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

3. **Likelihoods**: We need to estimate the probability that a professor from each group fits the description \( D \).
   - \( P(D|A) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches the description.
   - \( P(D|B) \): Probability that a humanities professor matches the description.

Since we don't have specific values, we make informed guesses based on typical characteristics described:
   - It's reasonable to assume that a humanities professor is more likely to fit the description of “creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, and gifted but not particularly technical.”
   - Therefore, let’s assume \( P(D|A) \) = low probability = 0.1 and \( P(D|B) \) = higher probability = 0.9

4. **Total Probability of Description \( D \)**:
   - \( P(D) = P(D|A)P(A) + P(D|B)P(B) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.75 + 0.9 \times 0.25 \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.3 \)

5. **Bayes’ Theorem**:
   - We need to calculate \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
   - \( P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D)} \)
   - \( P(A|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} \)
   - \( P(A|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \)
   - \( P(A|D) = 0.25 \)

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
