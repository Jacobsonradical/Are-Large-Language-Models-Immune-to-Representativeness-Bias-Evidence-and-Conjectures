To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, we need to define the relevant events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, is gifted, and passionate but not particularly technical.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We'll use the following steps:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(A') \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|A') \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the data, the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, but not technical) seems more likely to fit a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Let's assume reasonable estimates:

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \): Computer science professors are less likely to have this description.
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.5 \): Humanities professors are more likely to have this description.

Next, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.5 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.125 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.2} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.375 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ {"probability": "0.375"} \]
