To solve this problem, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample:

\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his personality traits (\( P(CS | D) \)). By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We do not have direct evidence about the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). However, since the description of Jason mentions that he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," "enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring," and is "gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," these traits seem more aligned with humanities professors based on common stereotypes.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.8 \) (High probability that a humanities professor matches this description)
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.2 \) (Lower probability that a computer science professor matches this description)

The total probability \( P(D) \) is found by the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting in our values:

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.20 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now we can compute \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.428 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.428.
