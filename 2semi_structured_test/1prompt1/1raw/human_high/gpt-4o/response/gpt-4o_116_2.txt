To solve this problem, we should use Bayesian reasoning. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find the probability \( P(C \mid D) \) where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

We need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

To use Bayes' theorem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Compute \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):**

Given in the problem, there are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total: 100 professors

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Compute \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \):**

Next, we need the likelihoods, \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). The description suggests traits more common in humanities professors, such as being imaginative and emotionally driven, rather than technical.

Assume (based on the description and common stereotypes) that the likelihood of a humanities professor having such a description is high, say 0.90, while the likelihood of a computer science professor having the description is lower, say 0.20.

\[ P(D \mid C) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(D \mid H) = 0.90 \]

3. **Compute the marginal likelihood \( P(D) \):**

This is the total probability of the description \( D \), and it can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(D) = (0.20 \times 0.75) + (0.90 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

4. **Compute the posterior probability \( P(C \mid D) \):**

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.75}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.40 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.40"\}} \]
