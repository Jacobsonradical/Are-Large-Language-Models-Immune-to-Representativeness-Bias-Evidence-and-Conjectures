Let's start by employing Bayes' theorem to compute the probability.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (C) = 75
- The number of humanities professors (H) = 25
- The total number of professors = 75 + 25 = 100

You are asked to compute \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ P(D | C) \cdot P(C) }{ P(D) } \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming we don't have specific numerical values for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we can make a reasoned guess based on the description. Since Jason is described as not particularly technical, emotionally driven, and passionate, characteristics not typically associated with technical fields like computer science, we might infer that:

- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively higher (let’s guess higher likelihood for humanities)
- \( P(D | C) \) is relatively lower (let’s guess lower likelihood for computer science)

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \)

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Therefore,

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ 0.2 \cdot 0.75 }{ 0.35 } \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ 0.15 }{ 0.35 } \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{ 3 }{ 7 } \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
