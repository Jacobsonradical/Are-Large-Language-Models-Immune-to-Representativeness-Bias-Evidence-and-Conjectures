First, let's assess the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the sample. We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors. 

The likelihood (prior probability) of picking a computer science professor at random is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The likelihood of picking a humanities professor at random is:

\[ P(\text{HU}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to adjust these base rates by considering how well Jason's description fits the typical profiles for these groups. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical. 

Characteristics like being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate align more closely with typical descriptions of humanities professors rather than computer science professors who might be more technical.

For simplicity, let's use subjective probabilities for how well Jason's profile fits the domains. Assume:

- Probability that Jason has this profile given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|HU) \), is 0.8.
- Probability that Jason has this profile given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \), is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{HU}) \cdot P(\text{HU})} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
