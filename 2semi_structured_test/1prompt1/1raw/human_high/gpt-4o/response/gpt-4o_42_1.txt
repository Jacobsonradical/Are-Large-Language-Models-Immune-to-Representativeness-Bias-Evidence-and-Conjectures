To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates (proportions) of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, as well as how well the description matches our stereotypical expectations of each group.

In our sample, we have:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

Now, letâ€™s use conditional probabilities. We need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.

Given the base rates:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, consider the descriptive probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description seems to align more typically with common perceptions of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Given this qualitative assessment, we might assume:

- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively low, let's hypothesize it to be around 0.2 (because he doesn't fit the stereotypical technical profile of a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively high, let's hypothesize it to be around 0.8 (because he fits the more creative, imaginative profile of a humanities professor).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.2) \cdot (0.75)}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
