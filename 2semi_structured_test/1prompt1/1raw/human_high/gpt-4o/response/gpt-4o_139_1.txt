To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to define our events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

We're looking to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

1. **Prior probabilities**:

   \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor)
   
   \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor)

2. **Likelihoods**:

   We need some reasonable assumptions about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

   - Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical), it seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.
   
   Let's assume:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (probability that a computer science professor has this description)
   
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.6 \] (probability that a humanities professor has this description)

3. **Marginal probability \( P(B) \)**:

   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.6 \cdot 0.25 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.15 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 \]

4. **Now we can apply Bayes' theorem**:

   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = 0.3333 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.3333.

Here is the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.3333"}
