To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason as a creative and imaginative, non-technical individual.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find the components on the right-hand side of the equation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \)**:
   - \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
   
   Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
   - \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

   It's reasonable to assume that a creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, non-technical description fits humanities professors better than computer science professors. Let's assume that \( P(D|C) \) is smaller than \( P(D|H) \). However, we're not given exact probabilities, so we can use proportions to make a general inference.

3. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we don't have exact numbers for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can use the information provided and general reasoning:

Given that the description more closely aligns with humanities professors, let's assume:
   \[ P(D|C) = 0.1 \] 
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

Now calculate \( P(D) \):
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275 \]

Finally, compute \( P(C|D) \):
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
   \[ P(C|D) \approx 0.2727 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
