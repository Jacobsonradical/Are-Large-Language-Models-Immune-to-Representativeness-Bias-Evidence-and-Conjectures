To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. We need to calculate \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any professor chosen at random is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (Note: \( H \) represents humanities.)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is the probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Since we do not have the exact likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can make an informed assumption based on the description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, which might be more typical of humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, we might assume:

\( P(D|CS) \le P(D|H) \)

Given the qualitative nature of the problem, let's assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

3. **Total probability of the description \( D \):**

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is roughly 0.4286.
