To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
    - The probability of picking a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - The probability of picking a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - If Jason were a computer science professor, what’s the likelihood he would have such a description?
    - If Jason were a humanities professor, what’s the likelihood he would have such a description?

Given he is described as creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, these traits might be more likely in humanities professors. However, without explicit numerical likelihoods, it's subjective. Let's assume:

    - Likelihood of this description for a CS professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (since these traits are less common in technical fields).
    - Likelihood of this description for a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (since these traits are quite common).

3. **Posterior Probability** using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, compute \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now compute \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.4286.
