To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's identify the relevant quantities:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a professor is in computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \): Probability that a professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|Hum) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

Priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \). Given that the description leans towards being more creative and imaginative, and less technical, we might assume such traits are less common in computer science professors compared to humanities professors. However, without exact probabilities, we can only make an educated guess.

Assuming \( P(D|CS) \) is lower than \( P(D|Hum) \), let's assign illustrative probabilities:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.8 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plug in the numbers:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
