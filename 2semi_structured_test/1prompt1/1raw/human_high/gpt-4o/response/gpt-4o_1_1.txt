To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should approach the problem using Bayes' theorem. However, we need to make certain assumptions, given the provided data. 

Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of a professor being in computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability of a professor being in the humanities, \( P(H) \):
     \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Assess the likelihood of the description fitting each discipline:**
   - We need to assume whether Jason's description is more likely indicative of a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Based on common stereotypes, a description that emphasizes creativity, imagination, and emotional drive might fit a humanities professor better than a computer science professor.
   
   For simplicity and due to lack of specific data to quantify these likelihoods, let’s assume:
   - Probability of this description given a computer science professor, \( P(D | CS) \): This may be relatively low, e.g., 0.2.
   - Probability of this description given a humanities professor, \( P(D | H) \): This may be relatively high, e.g., 0.8.

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**

   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \), calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(CS | D) \):**
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
