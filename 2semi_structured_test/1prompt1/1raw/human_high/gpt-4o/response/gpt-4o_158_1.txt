To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we need to find:

P(CS | Description)

Where:
- P(CS) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(Description | CS) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(H) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- P(Description | H) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- P(Description) is the total probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
   - P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihoods**:
   Since we don't have exact probabilities for the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we use the information given:
   Given Jason's description, it seems more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors (who are often, though not always, more technical).

   Let's assume:
   - P(Description | CS) = 0.2 (Assuming lower because the description seems less technical)
   - P(Description | H) = 0.8 (Assuming higher for alignment with humanities traits)

3. **Total Probability of the Description**:
   Using the law of total probability:
   - P(Description) = P(Description | CS) * P(CS) + P(Description | H) * P(H)
   - P(Description) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25)
   - P(Description) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   - P(CS | Description) = (P(Description | CS) * P(CS)) / P(Description)
   - P(CS | Description) = (0.2 * 0.75) / 0.35
   - P(CS | Description) = 0.15 / 0.35
   - P(CS | Description) â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is approximately 0.4286. Therefore, the answer is:
