To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here is the breakdown:

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description given for Jason.

We aim to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we are given the description \( D \) and need to find the likelihoods \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we use intuition based on the description for Jason. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, which fits more traditionally with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's assume:

- \( P(D \mid C) \) is quite low, due to the less technical nature of the description, let’s assume \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is high, fitting the humanities professor profile, let’s assume \( 0.9 \).

Next, we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
