To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will employ Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(CS) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(Jason|CS) \): The probability of Jason having his described traits given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(Jason|H) \): The probability of Jason having his described traits given that he is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have the exact likelihood values, we need to assume something about the likelihood based on the description provided. Jason’s traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and not particularly technical) seem more fitting for a humanities professor than for a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
   - \( P(Jason|CS) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(Jason|H) = 0.8 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Applying Bayes’ theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|Jason) = \frac{ P(Jason|CS) \times P(CS) }{ P(Jason) }
   \]

We first need \( P(Jason) \), the total probability of Jason’s description:
\[
P(Jason) = P(Jason|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Jason|H) \times P(H)
\]
\[
P(Jason) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)
\]
\[
P(Jason) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Now, applying the values to Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(CS|Jason) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS|Jason) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]
\[
P(CS|Jason) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
