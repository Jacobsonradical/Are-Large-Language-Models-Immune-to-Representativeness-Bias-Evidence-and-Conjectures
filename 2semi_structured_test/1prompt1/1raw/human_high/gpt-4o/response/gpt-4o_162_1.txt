To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the following:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

The probabilities we need to calculate are:

- \( P(C) \): The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | C) \): The probability of the given description \( D \) (Jason) given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the given description \( D \) (Jason) given that he is a humanities professor.

We have the following information from the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- And, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We can express \( P(D) \) as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, we are not given explicit numerical values for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Still, we can estimate these probabilities based on the description. Given Jason's personality traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, not particularly technical), these traits seem more characteristic of humanities professors.

Let's make reasonable assumptions: 

- \( P(D | C) \approx 0.2 \): There's a 20% chance a description with these traits belongs to a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.8 \): There's an 80% chance a description with these traits belongs to a humanities professor.

Now, we can use these to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2) \cdot (0.75) + (0.8) \cdot (0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{(0.2) \cdot (0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Thus, the answer is:
