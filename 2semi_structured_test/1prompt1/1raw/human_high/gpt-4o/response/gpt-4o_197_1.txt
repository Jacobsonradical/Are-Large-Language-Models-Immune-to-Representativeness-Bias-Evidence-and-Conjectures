To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

First, we identify the relevant quantities:

- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

The description suggests that Jason's characteristics may be more common in humanities professors. However, to numerically determine the probability, let's assume the traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, but not particularly technical) are more likely in humanities professors. Let's denote \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \) as higher than \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \), but for now, let us simplify and assume the following likelihood estimates to demonstrate the principle:

- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) = 0.2 \) (assuming the traits described are less common)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (assuming the traits described are more common)

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

First, compute \( P(\text{Description}) \) as the total probability of the description appearing either in Computer Science or Humanities:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Now, plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286. 

The answer, in the requested format, is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
