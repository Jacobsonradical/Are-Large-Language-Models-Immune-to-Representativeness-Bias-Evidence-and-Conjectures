Sure! Let's reason through this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Let’s denote:
- \(CS\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) as Jason's description.

Based on the provided numbers in the sample:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- So the total number of professors is \(75 + 25 = 100\).

\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Given Jason's description, to use Bayes' Theorem, we need \(P(D \mid CS)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\).

Assuming descriptions like Jason's are more likely to be associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors:
- Suppose we assign \(P(D \mid CS) = 0.1\) (as the description does not fit a typical computer science professor as closely).
- And \(P(D \mid H) = 0.9\) (as the description fits a typical humanities professor better).

Bayes’ theorem tells us:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring in the sample:
\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Now plug back into Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3}
\]
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
