To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to utilize Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description B.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description B given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description B occurring.

We know:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The next step would normally be to consider the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \), i.e., the probability of getting Jason's description given he is a computer science professor and given he is a humanities professor respectively. However, because we are computing this probabilistically and only have our priors to consider in this simplified model, we'll use the priors alone.

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75, or 75%.

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
