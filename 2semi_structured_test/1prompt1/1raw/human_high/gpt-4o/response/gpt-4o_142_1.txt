We need to use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.

Let's define:

- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of Jason having his description (creatively and emotionally driven, not particularly technical, etc.) given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of Jason having his description given that he is a humanities professor.

Based on the sample:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given Jason's description, it appears more aligned with traits common to humanities professors (creativity, imagination, emotional drive, etc.).

For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (since the description does not closely match traits typically expected in computer science professors).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (since the description closely matches traits typically expected in humanities professors).

We can now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is approximately 0.4286.
