To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description given of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of Jason having this description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason having this description irrespective of his field.

First, let's establish the priors and other required probabilities:
- The prior probability \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- Consequently, the prior probability \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\):
- \(P(D|CS)\): The description suggests Jason is "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, and not particularly technical." This set of traits seems more likely to be common among humanities professors rather than computer science professors, given that computer science often emphasizes technical skills.
- \(P(D|H)\): This set of traits is more aligned with the profile of a humanities professor.

Let's assume reasonable estimates for these likelihoods:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\) (since the traits are less common among computer science professors)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.8\) (since the traits are more common among humanities professors)

Now we need to calculate \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description irrespective of the field:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.275 \]

Finally, we compute \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{75}{275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{55} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.2727 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
