To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

Here is the formula for Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A = \) Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A = \) Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) \) = \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75
- \( P(\neg A) \) = \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25

Now, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which are the probabilities of the description being given to a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. 

Based on the description, Jason is described as emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys reading, traveling, and is not particularly technical. These traits might intuitively be more common in humanities.

For simplicity, let's assume the following intuitive probabilities (based on typical traits we might associate more with humanities scholars than with computer science professors):

- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (the description fits 20% of computer science professors)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \) (the description fits 80% of humanities professors)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286.

Here's the answer in the required format:
