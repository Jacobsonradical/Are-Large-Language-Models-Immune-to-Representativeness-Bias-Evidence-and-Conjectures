To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. We start by considering the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in the study. Given there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:

- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description being a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. The description notes that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and is not particularly technical. These traits might be slightly more common in humanities professors, but we need to consider how typical such a description is for each group.

Let's assume:
- P(Description | CS) = 0.3 (probability of a CS professor matching Jason’s description)
- P(Description | Humanities) = 0.7 (probability of a Humanities professor matching Jason’s description)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.225 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.4 \]

Now calculate \( P(CS | Description) \):

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{225}{400} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.5625 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is:

{"probability": "0.5625"}
