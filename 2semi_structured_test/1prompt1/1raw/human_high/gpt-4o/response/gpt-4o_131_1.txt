Based on the provided description of Jason and considering the base rate of the two groups in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability.

1. **Base rates**:
   - Number of computer science professors = 75
   - Number of humanities professors = 25
   - Total = 100

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - P(CS) = Probability that a professor is from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
   - P(H) = Probability that a professor is from humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

3. **Likelihood**:
   - P(D|CS) = Probability that the description matches a computer science professor
   - P(D|H) = Probability that the description matches a humanities professor

4. Using Bayes' theorem:
   - P(CS|D) = (P(D|CS) * P(CS)) / (P(D))

Since the problem does not provide specific numbers for the likelihoods (P(D|CS) and P(D|H)), we must consider Jason's description and make a subjective judgment. Given Jason's creative and imaginative personality, emotionally driven nature, and lack of technical inclination, this description seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Thus, let's subjectively assign:
- P(D|CS) ≈ 0.2
- P(D|H) ≈ 0.8

Then the overall probability P(D) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
- P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
- P(CS|D) = (P(D|CS) * P(CS)) / P(D) = (0.2 * 0.75) / 0.35 = 0.15 / 0.35 ≈ 0.4286

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

So the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
