To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of having the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description. 

Given:
- 75 computer science professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- 25 humanities professors, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since there is no explicit information on the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we assume if Jason's description fits more a humanities professor than a computer science professor based on stereotypical traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), the likelihoods might reflect this significantly:

- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) because Jason's description tends to fit less stereotypical computer science professors.
- Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \) because Jason's description tends to fit more stereotypical humanities professors.

Now, we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
