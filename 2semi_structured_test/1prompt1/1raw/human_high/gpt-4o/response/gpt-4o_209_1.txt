To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, we first need to set up the problem using the given information.

1. Total number of professors: 100
2. Professors in computer science: 75
3. Professors in humanities: 25

We need to determine the probabilities involved:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): Probability a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): Probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \): Probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Given the nature of the description, it seems more likely to fit a humanities professor. However, since we don’t have exact probabilities for \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \), we will have to make a reasonable assumption.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (20% chance)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (80% chance)

Next, we can use these values to calculate the overall probability using Bayes’ Theorem. The theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

First, we need to find \( P(\text{Description}) \). This can be found by considering the total probability of the description occurring in both groups.
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Given:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.35 \]

Then:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{(0.2 \times 0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
