To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which involves the following steps:

1. **Determine the proportions of professors in each group**:
   - 75 computer science professors
   - 25 humanities professors
   - Total = 100 professors

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities (\(P(HUM)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities (\(P(D|HUM)\))

From the description provided, it appears that Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) might be more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. We could roughly assume the following subjective likelihoods:
   - \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\)  (as being creative and not particularly technical is less common in computer science)
   - \(P(D|HUM) = 0.8\) (as these traits are more common in humanities)

4. **Posterior probability calculation using Bayes' theorem**:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description, calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|HUM) * P(HUM) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 * 0.75) + (0.8 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, compute \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is approximately 0.4286.

So the final answer should be:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
