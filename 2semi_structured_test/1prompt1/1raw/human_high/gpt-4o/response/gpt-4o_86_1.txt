To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the events:
- Event A: Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- Event B: Jason is one of the humanities professors.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D). 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Here's how we calculate each term:
1. \( P(A) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|B) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description, which can be computed using the law of total probability.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods Based on Description:**
   Given Jason's description, he seems more fitting for a humanities professor due to his creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven nature and less technical orientation. 
   For the sake of calculation, we estimate:
   - \( P(D|A) \approx \alpha \) (a low value since the description fits humanities better)
   - \( P(D|B) \approx \beta \) (a high value since the description fits humanities well)
   
   Assuming \( \alpha = 0.2 \) and \( \beta = 0.8 \) as reasonable estimates based on the description fitting a humanities professor more closely.

3. **Total Probability \( P(D) \):**
   \[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
   \[ P(A|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
