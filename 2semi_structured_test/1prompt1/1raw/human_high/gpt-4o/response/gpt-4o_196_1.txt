To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

We start by setting up our notation:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the specific description given for Jason.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We want \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Now we need to determine \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description matching a professor from either of the two fields. Without explicit probabilities for these, we typically use our judgment to estimate these values based on the description provided. 

Given Jason's traits: creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, and not particularly technical, it would seem these are traits more commonly associated with humanities than with computer science.

- Let's estimate \( P(D|C) \approx 0.2 \) (a computer science professor having these traits).
- Let's estimate \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (a humanities professor having these traits).

Now we need \( P(D) \), which can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2)(0.75) + (0.8)(0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.2)(0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4286. 

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
