To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant quantities:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
3. \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D | H) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Here's the information we have:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- Similarly, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

We also know that:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

To compute \( P(CS | D) \), we need estimates for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate, though not particularly technical"), it seems more likely to match humanities than computer science. This is a judgment we need to make because exact probabilities for these types are typically domains expertise assumptions.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (less likely given the description is not technical)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (more likely given humanities align more with the description)

Now we can compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
