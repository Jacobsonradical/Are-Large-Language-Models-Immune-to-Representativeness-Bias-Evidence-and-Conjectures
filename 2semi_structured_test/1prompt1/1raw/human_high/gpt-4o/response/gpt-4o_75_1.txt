To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event that the description applies to Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

We know:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To proceed, we need to estimate:
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the description suggests someone who is creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor. Assume:
- \( P(D|A) \) might be low because the traits fit less with the stereotypical technical nature of computer science professors. Let's assume \( P(D|A) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(D|B) \) might be high because the traits match well with the stereotypical nature of humanities professors. Let's assume \( P(D|B) = 0.8 \).

We now compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(A|D) \):

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
