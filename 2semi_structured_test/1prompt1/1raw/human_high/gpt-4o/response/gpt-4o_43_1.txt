To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here, we need to compute \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \).

First, let's outline the components:

1. **Prior probability \( P(CS) \)**
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Prior probability \( P(H) \)**
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Thus, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Evidence \( D \)**
   - The description provided seems to lean more towards humanities traits (creative, imaginative, less technical).

4. **Likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \)**
   - Let's assume the description \( D \) is \( D_{humanities} \).
   
5. **Posterior probability \( P(D) \)**
   - This is the probability of the description overall: \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \).

Assumptions on likelihood values (without exact test data):
- Let's assume \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively low because the description fits humanities better, say \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \).
- Let's assume \( P(D | H) \) is higher, say \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
