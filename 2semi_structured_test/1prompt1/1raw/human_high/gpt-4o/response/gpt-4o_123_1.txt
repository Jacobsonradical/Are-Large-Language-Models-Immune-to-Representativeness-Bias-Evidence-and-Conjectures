To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here’s how we can think through the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**: 
   - The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description of Jason seems to align better with traits that might be more common among humanities professors based on the given characteristics. However, without exact numerical data on how likely each group is to possess these traits, we need to make a reasonable estimate.
   
For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) is the likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description, and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) is the likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description. For the sake of demonstration, let's assume that the given traits are twice as likely among humanities professors compared to computer science professors:

   - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.3 \) (assumed likelihood a CS professor fits this description)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | H) = 0.6 \) (assumed likelihood a humanities professor fits this description)

3. **Posterior Probability** (using Bayes' theorem):
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   
   Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description appearing, calculated as:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.3 \cdot 0.75) + (0.6 \cdot 0.25) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]

   Now calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

```
{"probability": "0.6"}
