To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(Desc|CS) \)
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(Desc|Hum) \)

Since the description emphasizes creativity, emotional drive, and non-technicality, these traits might be more common among humanities professors. Therefore, we assume:
   \[
   P(Desc|CS) < P(Desc|Hum)
   \]

However, let's assign some proportional values for these likelihoods. Suppose the subjective probability that the description matches a computer science professor is 0.2 and the probability that the description matches a humanities professor is relatively higher at 0.8:
   \[
   P(Desc|CS) = 0.2, \quad P(Desc|Hum) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Total probability of the description, \(P(Desc)\):**
   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \times P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description is approximately:
