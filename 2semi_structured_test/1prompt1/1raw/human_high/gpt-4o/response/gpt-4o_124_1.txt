To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's define the following terms:

- \(P(CS)\) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(H)\) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\) = Probability of Jason's description.

We need to compute \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- \(P(CS)\) = 75/100 = 0.75 (proportion of computer science professors)
- \(P(H)\) = 25/100 = 0.25 (proportion of humanities professors)

Now, we need estimates for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Based on Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, passionate but not technical), it seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\) = 0.2 (relatively low because the description does not seem typical for computer science professors)
- \(P(D|H)\) = 0.8 (relatively high because the description seems typical for humanities professors)

To find \(P(D)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
