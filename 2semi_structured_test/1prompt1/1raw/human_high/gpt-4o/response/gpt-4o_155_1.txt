To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The formula for Bayes' Theorem in this context is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(D\)).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We start by calculating the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total, so \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), which represent the likelihoods of the description given the respective fields, are not provided. In the absence of specific likelihood values, we usually can't compute exact probabilities. But let's assume a hypothetical situation where, based on the description provided, it seems more likely fit for a humanities professor as it emphasizes creativity, imagination, and lack of technical inclination.

If we assume, for instance, \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) and \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \), we can then proceed to calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we can find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
