To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (CS) = \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (H) = \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   
2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description suggests Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Based on the given information, it seems more likely (although not impossible) that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.
   - Let's denote this probability as follows:
     - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) = Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
     - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \) = Probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

   - Given the description's nature, some assumptions must be made about these likelihoods. Let's reasonably assume:
     - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (lower probability because he is described as not particularly technical)
     - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.8 \) (higher probability given his creative and less technical nature)
   
3. **Normalizing Constant:**
   - To find the overall probability of the description under both scenarios (CS and H combined), we use:
     - \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \)
     - \( P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \)
     - \( P(\text{Description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \)

4. **Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem):**
   - Now, applying Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \)
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} \)
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \)
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{15}{35} \)
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{3}{7} \)
     - \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \approx 0.4286 \)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
