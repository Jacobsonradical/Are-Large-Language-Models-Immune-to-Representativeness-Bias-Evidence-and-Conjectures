To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS|D) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.
- \( P(H|D) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Expanding \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the likelihoods. Since the description hints towards characteristics more common among humanities professors due to its emphasis on creativity, imagination, and lack of technical skills, we will assume these prior likelihoods:

- Assume: \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (20% of CS professors fit this description)
- Assume: \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \) (70% of H professors fit this description)

Plugging in these values:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.175 = 0.325
\]

Now, calculating \( P(CS|D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.325} = \frac{0.15}{0.325} \approx 0.4615
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%.

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.4615"\}}
\]
