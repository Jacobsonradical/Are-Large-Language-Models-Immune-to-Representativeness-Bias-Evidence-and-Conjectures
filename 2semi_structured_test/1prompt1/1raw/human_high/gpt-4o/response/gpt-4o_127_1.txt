To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to find \( P(C | D) \), where \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, let's establish the probabilities:

1. \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
\[
P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

2. \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Now, without specific probabilities \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we need to rely on the prior probabilities and consider how likely the description fits each group based on typical stereotypes (since no specific test results are given).

Given the description, Jason seems to fit the profile of a humanities professor more closely, as he is creative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. We can make an educated guess:

- Let's assume \( P(D | C) = 0.1 \): The description "Jason" fits a computer science professor with a low probability.
- And \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \): The description "Jason" fits a humanities professor with a high probability.

To find \( P(D) \), we use the total probability rule:
\[
P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.9 \times 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3
\]

Finally, we can find \( P(C | D) \):
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.75}{0.3}
\]
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\{ "probability": "0.25" \}
\]
