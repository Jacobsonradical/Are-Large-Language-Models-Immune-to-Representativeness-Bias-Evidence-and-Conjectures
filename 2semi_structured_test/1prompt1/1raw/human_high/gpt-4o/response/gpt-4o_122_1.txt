To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The given data includes descriptions of 100 professors, split into 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Firstly, let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(HUM) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of getting a description like Jason's given the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|HUM) \) as the probability of getting a description like Jason's given the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of getting a description like Jason's.

From the data, we know:
\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
\( P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Let's assume \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|HUM) \) are our subjective likelihoods given the information about Jason. Since Jason's description fits more with traits associated with the humanities compared to the more technical nature of computer science, we assume:
\( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (creative, imaginative professors are less common in computer science)
\( P(D|HUM) = 0.9 \) (these traits are more common in humanities)

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.075 + 0.225 = 0.3 \]

So:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} = \frac{0.075}{0.3} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
