To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description fits Jason.

We want to find \(P(C | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

So,
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). These are the probabilities that a description like Jason's describes a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively. Given the description characteristics:

- Creative, imaginative, emotionally driven
- Enjoys traveling, reading, exploring
- Gifted and passionate, not particularly technical

These traits seem more likely to describe a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.

Let's assume, for the sake of calculation, that:
\[ P(D | C) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D | H) = 0.8 \]

Now, we calculate the total probability of the description: 
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.4286"}
