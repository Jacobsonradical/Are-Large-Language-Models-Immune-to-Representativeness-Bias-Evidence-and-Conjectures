Consider the given description of Jason. The task is to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the provided data and his characteristics. 

First, let's outline the numbers and characteristics:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The goal is to find the probability that Jason, described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical," is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Given the data, it makes sense to apply Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability. Let's define the variables for clarity:
- \( P(CS) = \) Prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \) Prior probability that a professor is a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate:
- \( P(D|CS) = \) Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D|Hum) = \) Probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities.

Because the description aligns more closely with humanities traits, we might reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is lower, say, 0.1 (since 'not particularly technical' is a notable point against being a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|Hum) \) is higher, say, 0.8 (since 'creative and imaginative' fits well within typical humanities traits).

Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.273 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
