To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can set up our calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**: This is the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The prior probability \( P(Hum) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**: This is the probability of the given description given the professor's subject.
   - We'll denote the given description by \( D \).
   - We need \( P(D|CS) \) (Probability of the description given a computer science professor) and \( P(D|Hum) \) (Probability of the description given a humanities professor).

Based on the description provided:
- Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys exploring and reading, and not particularly technical. These traits seem more aligned with the typical description of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Let's assume you assess subjective probabilities for the likelihood of the description:

  - \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (as it's less likely for a computer science professor to fit the description)
  - \( P(D|Hum) = 0.8 \) (as it's more likely for a humanities professor to fit the description)

3. **Posterior Probability** (using Bayes' theorem): This is what we want to find.

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Let's compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description is approximately 0.273.
