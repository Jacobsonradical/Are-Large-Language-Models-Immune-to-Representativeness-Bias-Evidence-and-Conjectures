To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is defined as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the sample sizes:
- 75 computer science professors (CS)
- 25 humanities professors (H)

We need to define our probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
2. \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) represent the likelihoods of the description given their respective groups. Given the description, Jason seems to fit more closely with common traits of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical), though this is subjective without detailed probabilities. For simplicity, assume:

- \( P(B|A) = 0.3 \): probability that a computer science professor matches the description.
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.7 \): probability that a humanities professor matches the description.

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

Plugging the numbers in:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.75}{0.3 \cdot 0.75 + 0.7 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.5625 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.5625.
