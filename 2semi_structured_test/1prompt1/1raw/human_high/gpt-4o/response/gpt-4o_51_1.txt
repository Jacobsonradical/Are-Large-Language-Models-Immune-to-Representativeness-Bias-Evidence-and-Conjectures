To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description.

First, define the following terms:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): Probability of the description.

Here are the estimates and known values:
- There are 75 computer science professors, hence \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, hence \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To find \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we need to estimate how indicative the description is of each group. Given the textual description, it seems to fit the profile of a humanities professor more closely.

Assuming \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (implying the description is less likely for a computer science professor) and \( P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \) (implying the description is more likely for a humanities professor):

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
