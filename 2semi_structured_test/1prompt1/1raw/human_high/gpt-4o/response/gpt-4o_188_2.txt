Given the problem, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's use Bayes' theorem for this calculation. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

Firstly, let's identify the probabilities we need to calculate:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Jason’s description.

We can start with \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \). Without detailed descriptions of others, let's assume descriptions like Jason's are less common among computer science professors and more common among humanities professors based on the "not particularly technical" part which fits humanities more.

Let's assign probabilities based on this assumption:
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason’s description if he is a computer science professor. This would be low given he's not particularly technical. Let's say \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \).
- \( P(B|¬A) \): Probability of Jason’s description if he is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor). Therefore, \( P(B|¬A) = 0.8 \).

Next, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A) \]
\[ P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.2 = 0.275 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \approx 0.273 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.273"} \]
