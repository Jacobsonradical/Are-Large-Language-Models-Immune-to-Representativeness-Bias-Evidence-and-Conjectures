To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which requires considering the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description fitting each category.

Here’s how we can compute it:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \) = Probability of a professor being in computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) = Probability of a professor being in humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) = Probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) = Probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

   Given the information, we need to make a reasonable assumption about these likelihoods based on the description provided. The description of Jason appears to fit a humanities professor more closely because it emphasizes creativity, imagination, and less technical ability. Thus, we might reasonably assume:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (Assumed likelihood for CS professors)
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (Assumed likelihood for Humanities professors)

3. **Using Bayes’ Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description appearing, which is a weighted sum:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
