To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll employ Bayes' theorem, which is appropriate for this kind of conditional probability problem.

First, let's denote the following:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description provided.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We break this down into components we can estimate:

1. **Prior probabilities**: 
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihoods**: 
   These need to be subjectively estimated based on the description. Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it may seem more likely that he is a humanities professor than a computer science professor based on common stereotypes.
   However, since these likelihoods require some subjective estimation and could vary, one could reasonably guess the following:
   \[
   P(D|C) = 0.2 \quad \text{(low, due to "not particularly technical")}
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(high, fits the humanities stereotype)}
   \]

3. **Overall likelihood of the description**: 
   By the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.429 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.429.
