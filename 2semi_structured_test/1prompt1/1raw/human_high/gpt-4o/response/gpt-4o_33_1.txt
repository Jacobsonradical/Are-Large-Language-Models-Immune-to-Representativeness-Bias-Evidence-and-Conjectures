To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here are the steps and the information we need:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The description suggests Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical," which might be less consistent with the typical stereotypes of computer science professors and more consistent with those in the humanities. But let's remain unbiased and use likelihoods as follows:
   - Let \( P(D | CS) \) be the likelihood of this description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(D | H) \) be the likelihood of this description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description seems to align more with humanities, we'll reasonably hypothesize:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.8 \)

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   We want to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

   By Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be found by:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(D) = 0.2 * 0.75 + 0.8 * 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

   Now computing \( P(CS | D) \):
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.75}{0.35} \approx \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, is approximately \(0.4286\).

So, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
