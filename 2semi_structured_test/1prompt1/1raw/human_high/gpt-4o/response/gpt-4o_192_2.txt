To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities)
- We're given Jason's description, which seems to match the profile of a humanities professor more than a computer science professor.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|D) \) â€” the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a professor being in computer science.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \):**

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):**

To estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we interpret the description. Jason's description fits better with the profile of a humanities professor due to attributes such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) could be relatively low since computer science professors might be less likely to fit this profile.
- \( P(D|H) \) could be relatively high since humanities professors are more likely to fit this profile.

For the sake of argument, let's assign values:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

4. **Overall Probability \( P(D) \):**

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

5. **Computing \( P(CS|D) \):**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
