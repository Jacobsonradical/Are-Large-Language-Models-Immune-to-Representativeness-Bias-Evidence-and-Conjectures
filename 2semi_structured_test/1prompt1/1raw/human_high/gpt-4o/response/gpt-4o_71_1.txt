To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor
- \( B \): Jason has the given description

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) is equally plausible for both computer science and humanities professors (as there is no given reason to think otherwise), the probability of the description given the professor's department is essentially the same. Thus:
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) would be treated similarly.

Since there are no specific details to differentiate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), letâ€™s assume for simplicity that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Now, calculate the total probability of the description \( B \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), we can simplify the total probability \( P(B) \):
- \( P(B|A) = x \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = x \)

Thus,
\[ P(B) = x \cdot P(A) + x \cdot P(\neg A) = x \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = x \]

So the Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
