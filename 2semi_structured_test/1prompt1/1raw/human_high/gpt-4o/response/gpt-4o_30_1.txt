To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us determine the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. 

In this case:
- Let \( C \) be the event that "Jason is a computer science professor."
- Let \( H \) be the event that "Jason is a humanities professor."
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Let's outline what we know:
- \( P(C) = \text{Prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \text{Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To determine \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we must estimate the likelihood of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor and if he is a humanities professor. Given that the description emphasizes creativity, imagination, and non-technicality, it seems more typical for a humanities professor. Without specific data, we can assume:

- \( P(D|C) = \text{Probability of the description given he is a computer science professor} = \alpha \) (where \(\alpha\) is a small number, suggesting non-technicality is less common in computer science)
- \( P(D|H) = \text{Probability of the description given he is a humanities professor} \approx 1 \) (where humanities often align with creativity and imagination)

Let's assume \(\alpha\) is significantly smaller than 1, say \(\alpha = 0.1\) for calculation simplicity.

Thus:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.325} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.23 \]

So, our probability is about 0.23.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.23"}
