To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the probability \(P(\text{CS}|\text{description})\).

Here's a step-by-step outline of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rates):**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science group: \(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities group: \(P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science, \(P(\text{description}|\text{CS})\).
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is in humanities, \(P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities})\).

Let us assume that likelihoods \(P(\text{description}|\text{CS})\) and \(P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities})\) are needed here but not provided directly. Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical, it's reasonable to infer a higher likelihood of belonging to the humanities, as these traits are less emphasized in computer science.

For simplicity, assume a reasonable likelihood:
- \(P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \approx 0.2\)
- \(P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.8\)

3. **Total Probability of the Description:**
   - \(P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})\)
   - \(P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)\)
   - \(P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35\)

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   - \(P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}\)
   - \(P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35}\)
   - \(P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286\)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
