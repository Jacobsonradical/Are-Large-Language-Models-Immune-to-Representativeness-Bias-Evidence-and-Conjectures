To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll define the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason fits the given description.

We want to compute \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we have:

\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(C | D) + P(H | D) = 1 \), we can simplify:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

From the data, \( P(C) \) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And \( P(H) \):

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now we assume \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \):

While we do not have exact probabilities, the description of Jason seems more aligned with the personality traits of humanities professors. Let’s denote \( P(D | H) \) as being more significant than \( P(D | C) \).

Let’s assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.2 \) (likelihood Jason fits the description given he's in computer science)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (likelihood Jason fits the description given he's in humanities)

Now we can calculate:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{(0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25)} = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
