To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 25
- Total number of professors = 100
- Description of Jason suggests a profile that might be more common in the humanities rather than in the technical field of computer science.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given Jason's profile, it seems more likely that he fits the humanities profile. Let's assume some hypothetical probabilities based on the description:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \): Probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \): Probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.

Now, we need to find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.3
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\{ "probability": "0.25" \}
