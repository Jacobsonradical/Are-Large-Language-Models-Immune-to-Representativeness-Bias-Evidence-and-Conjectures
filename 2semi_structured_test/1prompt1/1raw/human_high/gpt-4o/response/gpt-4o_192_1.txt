Based on the information provided, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. These are the prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we apply Bayes' theorem. However, we are only given the description and no specific likelihoods associated with that description belonging to either group. Given that, we can use the base rates to form our calculation.

Without specific likelihoods or additional statistical information about the traits of professors from each department, we rely primarily on the base rates:

\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) P(CS) / P(\text{description})
\]

Given our lack of specific likelihood information, we approximate \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) as implied by the base rates. Therefore, the calculation essentially hinges on the prior probabilities (since \( P(\text{description}) \)—the total probability of the description occurring—remains constant for both departments):
\[
P(CS \mid \text{description}) \approx P(CS) = 0.75
\]

Hence, based on the base rates without further specific disambiguating information:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.75"
\]
