To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Determine Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Determine Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \)
   - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|Hum) \)
   
   Since the description suggests traits more typically associated with humanities rather than computer science (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we will assume:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.2 \quad \text{and} \quad P(D|Hum) = 0.8
   \]

3. **Compute Posterior Probability:**
   - Use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
     \]
     Simplifying further:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
     \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the given description is approximately 0.4286.

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
