To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event "Jason is a computer science professor," and \( B \) be the event "Jason fits the given description."

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

### Steps to compute \( P(A|B) \):

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \) (Not a computer science professor, i.e., a humanities professor):**
   There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.
   \[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   - The description of Jason suggests characteristics that might seem more common among humanities professors.
   - To quantify, let's assume the probability of a computer science professor (like Jason) fitting this description is \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \):**
   - For humanities professors, the likelihood of fitting the description, let's assume \( P(B|A') \approx 0.8 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
