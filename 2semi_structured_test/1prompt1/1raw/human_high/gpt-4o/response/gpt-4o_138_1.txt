To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

Let's define the following:
- \( C \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Using Bayes' theorem, this probability is:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Firstly, we need to estimate the priors \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):
- \( P(C) \) is the probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we estimate \( P(D|C) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science, and \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities. 

- Given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys exploring, not particularly technical), it likely aligns more with typical descriptions of humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume:
  - \( P(D|C) \) is relatively low, say 0.1, since not being particularly technical and not aligning with stereotypical technical traits makes it less likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
  - \( P(D|H) \) is relatively high, say 0.9, since the description fits the stereotype of a humanities professor more closely.

Now we need to calculate \( P(D) \), the overall probability of the description. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
