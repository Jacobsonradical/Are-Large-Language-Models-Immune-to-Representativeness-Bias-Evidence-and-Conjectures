To compute the probability that Jason is one of the 75 computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates of computer science and humanities professors in our sample and compare them against the personality description provided.

We can use Bayes' theorem here. First, let's establish the following:

- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of observing the description.

The base rates are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Let's make an assumption regarding the likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | Hum) \). Given the description, "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical," it seems more likely to apply to a humanities professor than to a computer science professor. However, we need to place some numbers for the likelihoods to proceed:

- Let \( P(D | CS) = 0.2 \) (assuming a lower likelihood because the description seems less fitting for computer science professors)
- Let \( P(D | Hum) = 0.8 \) (assuming a higher likelihood because the description seems more fitting for humanities professors)

Using Bayes' theorem, we find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
0.2 \cdot 0.75 = 0.15
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\{"probability": "0.4286"\}
