To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given for Jason.

We want to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to account for the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). This quantifies how likely the description would apply to a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Here, we make a subjective estimate based on the description provided. 

Jason is described as:
- Creative and imaginative
- Often emotionally driven
- Enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring
- Gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical

These traits typically align more with common perceptions of humanities professors than computer science professors. While this is a subjective judgement, we might estimate:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (since Jasonâ€™s characteristics are less typical for computer science professors)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (since these characteristics are more typical for humanities professors)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.4286 \).
