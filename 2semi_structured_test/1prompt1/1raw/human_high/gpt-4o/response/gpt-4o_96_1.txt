To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps involved:

1. Let \(C\) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \(H\) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. Let \(D\) represent the description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

Here's what we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Therefore, \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) and \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

Without specific probabilities for \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\), we can use the principle of proportionality since the sample sizes are known.

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that his traits such as being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical align more with the humanities. However, since we need to rely on the base rates in absence of concrete numbers, we continue with:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are unknown, let's assume they are equal for simplification due to lack of specific values provided:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) = p \]

Thus,
\[ P(D) = p \cdot P(C) + p \cdot P(H) = p (P(C) + P(H)) = p(0.75 + 0.25) = p \]

The value of \(p\) cancels out in the fraction:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{p \cdot 0.75}{p} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, based on the given description, is:

\[ \boxed{0.75} \]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
