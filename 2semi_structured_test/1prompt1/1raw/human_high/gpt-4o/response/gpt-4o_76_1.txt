To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we will use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description matches Jason.

1. \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]  (Probability that he is one of the 75 computer science professors)

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \] (Probability that he is one of the 25 humanities professors)

To proceed, we need to estimate:

1. \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen computer science professor matches the description.
2. \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen humanities professor matches the description.

The description suggests traits like creativity, imagination, and emotional drive, which might be more common among humanities professors. Thus, we might assign a higher probability that a humanities professor fits this description compared to a computer science professor. However, without specific data on how well the description fits each group, let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) \) (description matches a computer science professor): We might assign a lower probability here due to the emphasis on non-technical traits.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (description matches a humanities professor): We might assign a higher probability.

Assuming reasonable probabilities based on the description:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \)

Using the Law of Total Probability to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
