To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider two pieces of information:

1. The base rates (prior probabilities) of the groups.
2. The likelihood of observing Jason's description given the group.

Let's start with the base rates:

- Number of computer science professors (CS): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

So, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we assume \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \). Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) seems more common among humanities professors, so let's set some reasonable values for these conditional probabilities:

- P(description | CS) = 0.2 (less likely for a CS professor)
- P(description | H) = 0.8 (more likely for a humanities professor)

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

\[ P(H | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(CS | \text{description}) \):

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus,

{"probability": "0.4286"}
