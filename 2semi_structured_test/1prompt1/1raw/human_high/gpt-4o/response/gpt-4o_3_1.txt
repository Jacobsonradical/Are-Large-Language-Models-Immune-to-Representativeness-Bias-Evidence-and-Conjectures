To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the events as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
  
We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{description} \mid C) \)) and given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(\text{description} \mid H) \)). Without specific data on the likelihoods from the study, we need to make a reasoned estimate based on the description given:

- The description of Jason states that he is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical," traits that are stereotypically more associated with humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:
  - \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) is relatively low.
  - \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \) is relatively high.

However, since we don't have exact values, we'll use approximate likelihoods based on the descriptions:
- \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = 0.2 \) (assuming low likelihood due to not being particularly technical)
- \( P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.8 \) (assuming high likelihood due to traits like creativity and being emotionally driven)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is calculated as:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.35 \]

Finally:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
