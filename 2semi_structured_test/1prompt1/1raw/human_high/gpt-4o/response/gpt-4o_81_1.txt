To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

We are given:
- 75 professors in computer science
- 25 professors in the humanities
- A description of Jason that fits best with a humanities professor

Let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( HU \): Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): Jason's description

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Here:
- \( P(CS) \) = prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(HU) \) = prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To use Bayes' theorem, we also need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HU) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science or humanities professor. Without exact numerical likelihoods, and given the description's alignment with humanities traits, a reasonable assumption is:
- \( P(D | CS) \), the likelihood of a computer science professor fitting Jason's description, is low.
- \( P(D | HU) \), the likelihood of a humanities professor fitting Jason's description, is high.

Let's assume conservatively that:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D | HU) \approx 0.9 \)

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
