To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must utilize Bayes' theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description given.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description,
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of Jason having the description overall.

Firstly, we know:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the probability of Jason's description given his field (\(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\)) reflects the characteristics accurately described (i.e., creative and imaginative) and knowing that usually humanities professors might fit this stereotype more often than computer science professors, let's say \( P(D|C) \) is unlikely but not impossible, and \( P(D|H) \) is fairly likely.

For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(D|C) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now calculate \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.42857 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.42857.
