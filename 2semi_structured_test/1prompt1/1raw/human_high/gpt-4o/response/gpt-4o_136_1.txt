To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(A) \): the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
3. \( P(B) \): the overall probability of the given description.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A) \)
This is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(B|A) \)
This probability is the likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description. Based on the description, he does not seem like a typical computer science professor (not particularly technical). Therefore, we could reasonably assign a lower probability here. Since no specific numbers are given, let's assume a reasonable guess:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.2 \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \)
This is the overall probability of the given description, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor, and \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description. Given Jason's description, he seems to fit humanities professor better:
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.8 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

### Step 4: Calculate \( P(A|B) \)
Now, plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.43 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.43.
