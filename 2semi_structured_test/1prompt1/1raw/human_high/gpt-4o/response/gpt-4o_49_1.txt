To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which combines prior information with likelihood to compute a posterior probability.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - Probability that the description is of a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \):
      \[
      P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
      \]
    - Probability that the description is of a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \):
      \[
      P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
      \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \):
      - Since the description mentions characteristics that seem less typical for a technical field like computer science, let's assign a hypothetical probability of 0.2.
    - The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \):
      - Given that the description fits more closely with typical humanities traits, let's assign a hypothetical probability of 0.8.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
    \[
    P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})}
    \]
    Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description:
    \[
    P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
    \]

    Plugging in the values:
    \[
    P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
    \]

4. **Calculate the Posterior Probability:**
    \[
    P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
    \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.4286"}
\]
