To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which considers both the total number of professors in each category and how likely the description fits each category.

First, let's establish the base rates (prior probabilities):
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is \( 75 + 25 = 100 \).

The base rate probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihood of the description fitting each category. Here, we must consider the description provided:

Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is passionate but not particularly technical.

By intuition, such descriptions are typically more common for humanities professors than for computer science professors, who might be described more often as technical and analytical.

Let's assign:
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) (likelihood that a humanities professor matches the description)
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) (likelihood that a computer science professor matches the description)

Assume the description (using a subjective and intuitive estimate for illustrative purposes):
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.2 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.8 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.2 \times 0.75) + (0.8 \times 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, calculate \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
