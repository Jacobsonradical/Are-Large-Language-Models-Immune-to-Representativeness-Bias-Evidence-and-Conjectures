To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the observed description of Jason.

Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. Prior Probability \( P(A) \)
The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### 2. Complementary Event \( P(\neg A) \)
The event that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### 3. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)
The likelihood of getting the description if Jason is a computer science professor. This is subjective but based on the description, Jason seems to fit the stereotype of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \]
(that is, only 10% of computer science professors fit that description)

### 4. Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)
The likelihood of getting the description if Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \]
(that is, 80% of humanities professors fit that description)

### 5. Total Probability \( P(B) \)
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

### 6. Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \)
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.1 \cdot 0.75)}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{75}{275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{11} \approx 0.273 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.273.
