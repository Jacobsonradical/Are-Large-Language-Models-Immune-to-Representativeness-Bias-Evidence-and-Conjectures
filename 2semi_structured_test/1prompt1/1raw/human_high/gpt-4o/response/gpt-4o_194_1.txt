To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting the description provided.

First, let's outline what we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \), the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Given the description, Jason seems to align more with characteristics typically associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, we can make some educated assumptions:

- Let's assume \( P(B|CS) = 0.2 \), indicating that the description is somewhat unlikely for a computer science professor.
- Let's assume \( P(B|H) = 0.8 \), indicating that the description is quite likely for a humanities professor.

Finally, we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
