To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason's personality description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, etc.).

We want \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The marginal probability of Jason's description.

Let's determine \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, \( P(B|A) \):

We don't have specific data on how likely a computer science professor is to have Jason's traits, but since Jason's description mentions he is "not particularly technical," it might be less likely for a computer science professor. However, without specific numbers, we will assume that it is also relatively low. Let's hypothesize \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (10%).

Next, \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( \neg A \) represents the event that Jason is not a computer science professor, i.e., he is a humanities professor. Given there are 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We now need \( P(B|\neg A) \):
Given Jason's description fits more traditionally with humanities due to his creativity, imagination, and non-technical nature, we can assume this probability is higher. Let's hypothesize \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.7 \) (70%).

Now calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.175 = 0.25 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.25} = 0.3 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability"}: "0.3"} \]
