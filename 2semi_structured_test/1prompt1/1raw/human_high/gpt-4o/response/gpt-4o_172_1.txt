To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem to incorporate the base rates and the given description. 

We start with the following base rates:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
  
We are given the description of Jason and need to find the probability that he is a computer science professor based on this description.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
  
We are interested in \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We need the probabilities \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \), \( P(C) \), and \( P(\text{description}) \).

1. Prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The denominator \( P(\text{description}) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that we do not have specific probabilities for \( P(\text{description} \mid C) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \), we should make a reasonable assumption based on the provided description. Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, and passionate but not particularly technical. These traits suggest that Jason is more likely to be a humanities professor.

To proceed, let's make an assumption consistent with this bias:
- Assume \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = 0.1 \)
- Assume \( P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.9 \)

Now compute \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.9 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.3 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore,
