To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update probabilities based on new information.

First, let's define our variables:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

Let’s specify the given numbers first:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Hypothetically, let’s assume that given the description, the personality traits described are more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors. For simplicity, let’s assume:

- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \), meaning there’s a 20% chance that a computer science professor fits this description.
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \), meaning there’s an 80% chance that a humanities professor fits this description.

To find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

So, the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
