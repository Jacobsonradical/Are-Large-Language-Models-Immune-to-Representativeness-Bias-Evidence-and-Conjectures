To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description fits Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we determine the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[
P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description regardless of whether Jason is in computer science or humanities:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

To proceed, we need to consider the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason fits a humanities professor profile. We can subjectively estimate these probabilities. Let's assume:

\[
P(D|C) = 0.2 \quad \text{(assuming not particularly technical fits less with computer science)}
\]
\[
P(D|H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(assuming creative and imaginative fits more with humanities)}
\]

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
\]

Finally, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
