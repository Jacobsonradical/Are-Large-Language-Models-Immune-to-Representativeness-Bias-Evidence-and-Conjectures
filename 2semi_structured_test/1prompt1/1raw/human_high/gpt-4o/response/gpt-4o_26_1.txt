To compute this probability, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. Let \( D \) represent the description provided.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since Jason is chosen randomly from a group of 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, we have:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability of choosing a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability of choosing a humanities professor)

To proceed further, we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability that Jason fits the given description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability that Jason fits the given description if he is a humanities professor.

However, without additional specific data, it's reasonable to assume that the description provided (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical) might more closely align with the typical perception of a humanities professor. Let's hypothetically assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.5 \)

Now, we can use the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.5 \cdot 0.25) = 0.075 + 0.125 = 0.2 \]

Now we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.2} = \frac{0.075}{0.2} = 0.375 \]

Thus:

\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.375" \]
