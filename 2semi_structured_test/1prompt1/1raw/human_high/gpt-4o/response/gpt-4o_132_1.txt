To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

1. Let \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to find \(P(C)\), \(P(H)\), and \(P(D)\).

- \(P(C)\) (the prior probability that any professor chosen at random is a computer science professor) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

- \(P(H)\) (the prior probability that any professor chosen at random is a humanities professor) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\), which are the likelihoods of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

Given the description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, not particularly technical"), it seems more likely to describe a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

However, we don't have exact quantitative values for these probabilities. Thus, we need to make an educated estimate. Letâ€™s assume:

- \(P(D|C)\) might be low, say \(0.1\)
- \(P(D|H)\) might be high, say \(0.9\)

We can now compute \(P(D)\) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \(0.25\). 

Here is the answer in the required format:
