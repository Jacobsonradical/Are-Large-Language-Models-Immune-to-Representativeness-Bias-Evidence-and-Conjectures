First, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on Jason's description. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's denote:
- \( A_1 \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_2 \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Description of Jason.

First, we calculate the priors:

\[ P(A_1) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to make an assumption about the likelihoods \( P(B|A_1) \) and \( P(B|A_2) \). Jason's description fits more generally with a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). It is reasonable to assume that the description is more likely to appear in the humanities group than in the computer science group.

Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A_1) = 0.2 \]  (assuming such a person is less common among computer scientists)
\[ P(B|A_2) = 0.8 \]  (assuming such a person is more common among humanities professors)

Now, we compute \( P(B) \), the overall probability of Jason's description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1)P(A_1) + P(B|A_2)P(A_2) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.2)(0.75) + (0.8)(0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can compute the posterior probability \( P(A_1|B) \):

\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1)P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{(0.2)(0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description is approximately 0.4286.
