To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We'll use the provided information to calculate the probability.

First, let's denote the following:
- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \(P(CS|D)\), where \(D\) is the description of Jason.

Bayes’ theorem states that:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \(P(CS)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - \(P(H)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities: \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(D|H)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Without specific numerical values for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\), we assume that certain traits (like not being particularly technical and being emotionally driven) are more common in humanities professors. Therefore, let's assume \(P(D|H) > P(D|CS)\). For simplicity, if we assign them as:
  - Let \(P(D|CS) = x\)
  - Let \(P(D|H) = y\)

Since \(P(D|H) > P(D|CS)\), let \(y = kx\) where \(k > 1\).

3. **Total Probability**:
\[P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + y \cdot 0.25\]
\[P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + kx \cdot 0.25\]
\[P(D) = x (0.75 + 0.25k)\]

4. **Bayes' Theorem Application**:
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x (0.75 + 0.25k)}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25k}\]

Because we’re assuming \(P(D|H) = k \cdot P(D|CS)\) and \(k > 1\), let's estimate with \(k = 2\) as a more straightforward assumption for understanding:

\[P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + 2x \cdot 0.25\]
\[P(D) = x (0.75 + 0.50)\]
\[P(D) = x \cdot 1.25\]

Thus:
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{1.25}\]
\[P(CS|D) = 0.6\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.6"}
