To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science:
     \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities:
     \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|C) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more consistent with typical traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

For this scenario, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) (assuming it’s less likely, but possible Jason is a non-typical computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (assuming it’s more likely given the non-technical and creative description)

3. **Total probability of the description (normalizing constant):**
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

4. **Posterior probability:**
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
   \[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
