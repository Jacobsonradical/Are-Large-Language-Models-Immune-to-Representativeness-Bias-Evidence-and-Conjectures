To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason fits this particular description.

First, compute \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in humanities.

Therefore:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the descriptions:
- Based on typical stereotypes, Jason's description of being creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical might fit humanities professors more often than computer science professors.

While the exact probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are subjective without specific data, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of this description given Jason is a computer science professor) can be relatively low. Let's assume it as 0.2.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability of this description given Jason is a humanities professor) might be higher. Let's assume it as 0.8.

To get \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.429 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.429"\}} \]
