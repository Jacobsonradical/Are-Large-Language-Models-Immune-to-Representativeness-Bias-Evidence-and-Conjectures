Let's proceed with the information given and apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

To compute this, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor.

1. **Base rates:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)).
   - We also need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)).

Given the description, Jason does not seem particularly technical and is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might be less stereotypical of a computer science professor and more typical of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's suppose:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (Not a typical fit for a computer science professor)
   - \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (A good fit for a humanities professor)

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

And \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Thus:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately \(0.43\).

Thus, the final answer is:
{"probability": "0.43"}
