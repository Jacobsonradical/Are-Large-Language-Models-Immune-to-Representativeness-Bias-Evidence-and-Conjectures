To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that Jason's description is equally likely to describe a humanities professor as a computer science professor, we can say:
- \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) can be determined by how typical the traits are for each group.

If we assume that Jason's traits are more likely to be associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors (given descriptors like "creative," "imaginative," and "not particularly technical"), then \( P(D | H) \) might be higher.

However, if we assume that the personality traits are about equally likely in both samples without additional data on the specific weighting of characteristics:

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \times P(C) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(D | X) \), where \( X \) represents either discipline.

For simplicity, the numerator and the denominator will have this common factor cancel out:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx \frac{0.75 \times P(D | X)}{(0.75 \times P(D | X) + 0.25 \times P(D | X))} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.75}{1.00} = 0.75 \]

Thus:
