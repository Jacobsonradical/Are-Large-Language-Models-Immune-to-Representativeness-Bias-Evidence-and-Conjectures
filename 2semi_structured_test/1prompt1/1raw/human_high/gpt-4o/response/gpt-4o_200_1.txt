To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we determine the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, since we don't have the exact probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we will assume that Jason's description fits the humanities professor better than the computer science professor because it mentions he's not particularly technical and highlights creativity and exploration, which are typically more associated with humanities.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the likelihoods and the total probability \( P(D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, without precise values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can only use reasonable assumptions. Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)  (since the description is less likely to fit a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)  (since the description is more likely to fit a humanities professor)

Given these assumptions, we compute \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
