To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We want to find \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \).

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(C) \)) is 75 out of 100.
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(H) \)) is 25 out of 100.

Without additional information, assume that all professors (computer science or humanities) could fit the given description with equal likelihood. This is equivalent to saying \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \).

Thus, by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be computed as:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we assume \( P(\text{description} \mid C) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \]

Therefore, \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description} \mid C)} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = P(C) \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
