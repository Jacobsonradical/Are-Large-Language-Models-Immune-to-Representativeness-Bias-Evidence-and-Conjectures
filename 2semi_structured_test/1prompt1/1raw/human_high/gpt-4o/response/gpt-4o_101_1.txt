To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula for this scenario is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let’s clarify each term with the information given:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \):**
   This is the fraction of computer science professors in the sample:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \):**
   The fraction of humanities professors in the sample:
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Probability of Description Given Profession \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
   Since the description seems to fit a humanities profile more (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), we might conjecture that the probability is higher for humanities; however, we do not have explicit details. We can use an educated guess for these probabilities.

   Let's assume:
   \[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(D) \):**
   This combines the probabilities given each profession:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
