To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here's the setup:

- We want to determine P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- We know the base rates: 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- Therefore, P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 and P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 where H represents humanities.
- Let D represent the description provided for Jason.

We need to compute P(D | CS) and P(D | H), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. 

Given the description, Jason is not particularly technical, which might suggest a lower probability for a computer science professor and higher for a humanities professor. However, without direct statistical evidence from the study about detailed distributions, we assume some subjective probabilities based on general traits:

- P(D | CS) could be relatively low because it said Jason is not particularly technical.
- P(D | H) could be higher since traits like being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven might be more common in the humanities.

Let's make assumptions based on general reasoning without exact data for the purpose of demonstration:

- Assume P(D | CS) = 0.1 (subjectively low probability due to lack of technical alignment)
- Assume P(D | H) = 0.6 (subjectively higher probability aligned more with humanities)

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Calculating P(D):

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.6 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.15 = 0.225 \]

Now, calculate P(CS | D):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.225} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.225} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.333\]

So, according to these assumptions, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.333"}
