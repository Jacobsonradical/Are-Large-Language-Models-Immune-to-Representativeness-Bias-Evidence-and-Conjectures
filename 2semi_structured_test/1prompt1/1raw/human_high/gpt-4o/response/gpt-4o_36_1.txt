To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) be the overall probability of the description.

From Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we must determine \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \). Based on the description given, Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring) seem to align more closely with typical humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) > P(D|\text{CS}) \).

For the sake of the calculation, letâ€™s consider the probabilities \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \) and \( P(D|\text{CS}) \). Suppose \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) and \( P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \).

Now, calculate the overall probability of the description \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, compute \( P(\text{CS}|D) \):
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.4286.
