Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Hence, the prior probabilities are: 
  \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Let's assume whether a professor (computer science or humanities) fits the given personality description is independent of their field but each field has different likelihoods of producing this type of description:

- Let \( P(D \mid C) \) be the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
- Let \( P(D \mid H) \) be the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

Suppose that the nature of the description fits more closely with what we might expect from a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). If we do not have exact percentages, we can estimate likelihoods based on the qualitative data.

Assuming some reasonable likelihood values:
- \( P(D \mid C) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.7 \)

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to determine \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.7 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.3 \]

Therefore, given the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.3"}
