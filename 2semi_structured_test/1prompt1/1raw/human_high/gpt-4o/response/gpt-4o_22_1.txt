To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we’ll use Bayes' theorem. In this context, we want to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Here's the formulation of Bayes' theorem for this situation:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that the professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

First, we compute the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which describe how likely someone from each group is to have Jason's described characteristics. Given the description, Jason’s characteristics might align better with the humanities profile (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical).

Assuming a reasonable set of likelihoods based on the description:
- Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) (since Jason is described as not particularly technical, which may be less common among computer science professors)
- And \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (since his description fits very well with typical humanities profiles)

Now we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.9 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.30 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.075}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
