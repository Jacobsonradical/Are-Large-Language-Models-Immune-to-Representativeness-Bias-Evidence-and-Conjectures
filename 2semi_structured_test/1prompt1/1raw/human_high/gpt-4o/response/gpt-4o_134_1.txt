To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to rely on Bayes' Theorem. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the information given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C).
- There are 25 humanities professors (H).

Prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihood \( P(description|C) \) and \( P(description|H) \). Without specific numbers for these likelihoods, we often approximate using the description's fit to common stereotypes or assumed distributions. However, for simplicity, if we assume that Jason's non-technical, creative, and imaginative description is more typical for humanities professors than for computer science professors, \( P(description|H) \) is higher than \( P(description|C) \).

Given no numerical likelihoods, we need to make a justifiable assumption. Commonly, we balance these approximate terms equally just to illustrate the calculation approach:

\[ P(description|C) \approx \alpha \]
\[ P(description|H) \approx \beta \]

For simplicity, if we assume \( \alpha = 0.3 \) and \( \beta = 0.7 \), where \( \beta \) is higher since the description fits better to the stereotype of a humanities professor:

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|description) = \frac{P(description|C)P(C)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) = P(description|C)P(C) + P(description|H)P(H) \):

\[ P(description) = (0.3 \times 0.75) + (0.7 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.225 + 0.175 = 0.4 \]

Now we compute \( P(C|description) \):

\[ P(C|description) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.75}{0.4} = \frac{0.225}{0.4} = 0.5625 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
