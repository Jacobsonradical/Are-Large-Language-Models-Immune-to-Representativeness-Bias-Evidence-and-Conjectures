To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor

We need to compute \(P(C | \text{description})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Let’s break this down step-by-step:
1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Total: 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \):**
   - This part involves subjective judgment unless we have specific data. We need to estimate the likelihood (probability) of the given description for both computer science and humanities professors.
   - Given the description, Jason appears to have traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) that might be more common among humanities professors than computer scientists.
   - Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume that \( P(\text{description} | H) > P(\text{description} | C) \). For the sake of this calculation, let's assume \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.2 \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.8 \) to reflect this.

3. **Marginal Probability \( P(\text{description}) \):**
   - This is the total probability of the description occurring, considering both groups:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
\[ \boxed{0.4286} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
