To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided for Jason.

We want to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We start with the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need the likelihoods. \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. 

Because the description indicates Jason is not particularly technical and emotionally driven, it seems more consistent with a humanities professor. However, we lack precise likelihood values, so we make an assumption about the relative likelihoods. For simplicity, let's assume that:

\[ P(D|C) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

Now, compute \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, compute \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
