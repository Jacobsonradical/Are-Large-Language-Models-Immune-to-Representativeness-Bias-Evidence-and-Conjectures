To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to compute the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Given the description of Jason, we need to determine how likely he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Here are the steps:

1. **Compute the prior probabilities:** These are based on the initial proportions.

   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \(P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Compute the likelihood of the description given the profession:**

   We will denote the description as \(D\).
   
   - Likelihood of \(D\) given computer science (\(P(D|CS)\)): Let's assume \(P(D|CS) = x\)
   - Likelihood of \(D\) given humanities (\(P(D|Hum)\)): Let's assume \(P(D|Hum) = y\)

   Since the description seems to fit a humanities professor more closely ("creative," "imaginative," "not particularly technical"), let's make some assumptions about these likelihoods. Suppose:

   - \( x = 0.2 \)
   - \( y = 0.8 \)

3. **Compute the total probability of the description:**

   The total probability \(P(D)\) is given by:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.4286\).

Let's format the answer as requested:
