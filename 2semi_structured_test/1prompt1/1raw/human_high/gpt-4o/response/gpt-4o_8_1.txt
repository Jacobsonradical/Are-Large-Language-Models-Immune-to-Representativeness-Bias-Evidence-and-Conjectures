To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events. It's given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the base rate probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H \): Jason is one of the humanities professors.

From the problem statement, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.

So, the base rates are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description, Jason seems to have traits that align more closely with those typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, etc.).

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

For this computation, let's make an educated guess based on typical stereotypes and traits:

- Assume the probability that a computer science professor has Jason's traits is fairly low due to the description not being technical and rather emotionally driven. Let's say \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.2 \).
- The probability that a humanities professor has Jason's description is higher. Let's assume \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.8 \).

Now, we calculate the total probability of Jason's description \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \):
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately:
