To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the samples:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), where \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Because we do not have the exact probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \), we can use the description to infer the likelihoods. Based on the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring â€“ traits that seem more likely for a humanities professor.

Given this, we assign:
- \( P(B|A) \): Likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits might be lower. Let's assume it is 0.2.
- \( P(B|H) \): Likelihood of a humanities professor having these traits might be higher. Let's assume it is 0.8.

Next, we compute the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286, or in the requested format:
