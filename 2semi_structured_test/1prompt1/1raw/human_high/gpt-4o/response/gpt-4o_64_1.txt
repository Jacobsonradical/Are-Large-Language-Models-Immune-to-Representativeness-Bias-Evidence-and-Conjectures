To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, let's apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) based on new evidence (his description).

### Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\(P(CS)\)): 75
- Number of humanities professors (\(P(HUM)\)): 25
- Total professors: 100

### Probabilities:
- Prior probability of being a computer science professor: \(P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- Prior probability of being a humanities professor: \(P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to consider how likely it is that a given description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, not particularly technical) seems more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities rather than computer science.

Let’s estimate:

- Probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)): Since the description doesn’t fit the typical stereotype of a computer science professor, this could be estimated low. Let's assume \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\).
- Probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|HUM)\)): This fits more with the stereotype of a humanities professor. Let’s assume \(P(D|HUM) = 0.8\).

Now, let’s apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(HUM|D) = \frac{P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

### Calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

### Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the probability in the required format:
