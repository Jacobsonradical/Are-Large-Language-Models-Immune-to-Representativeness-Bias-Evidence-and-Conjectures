To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. This requires the following steps:

1. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is 75 out of 100 professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \), is 25 out of 100 professors: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. Evaluate the likelihoods: We need to make assumptions about the likelihood of someone with Jason's description being from the computer science or humanities groups. Given the description emphasizes traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it may be more likely for someone like Jason to be in the humanities rather than computer science. However, in the absence of precise likelihoods, let's denote:
   - Probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
   - Probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(D|Hum) \).

3. We can use Bayes’ Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|Hum) * P(Hum)} \]

Without specific numerical values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \), but assuming based on the description that \( P(D|Hum) > P(D|CS) \), we qualitatively understand that Jason is more likely to be in humanities. However, let’s proceed with an assumed likelihood — for instance, if we assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(D|Hum) = 0.4 \)

Then we have:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 * 0.75}{0.1 * 0.75 + 0.4 * 0.25} = \frac{0.075}{0.075 + 0.1} = \frac{0.075}{0.175} \approx 0.4286 \]

Hence, the probability would be:
