To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Given Information:**
   - There are \( 75 \) computer science professors (\( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
   - There are \( 25 \) humanities professors (\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).

3. **Description Fit:**
   - \( P(D | C) \): Probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | H) \): Probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason:
- Emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, not particularly technical. These traits seem more in line with humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

4. **Assign Likelihoods:**
   - Due to the traits described, we can assume \( P(D | H) \) is higher than \( P(D | C) \), but we need approximate values.
   - Let's assume for the sake of the calculation (based on typical stereotypes), \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(D | C) = 0.2 \).

5. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

6. **Compute \( P(D) \):**
   \[
   P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35
   \]

7. **Compute \( P(C | D) \):**
   \[
   P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \approx 0.4286
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{0.4286}
\]

In the required format:

\[
{"probability": "0.4286"}
\]
