To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the given description for a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the given description.

We know the following:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C) and 25 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- \( P(A) = P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without specific information on the probability of the description for each group (i.e., \( P(B|C) \) and \( P(B|H) \)), we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore:

\[ P(B|C) \approx P(B|H) \]

Since the problem doesnâ€™t specify otherwise, we can assume the description is uniformly likely across both groups, meaning:

\[ P(B) = P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(B|C) \) and \( P(B|H) \) are the same and cancel out, Bayes' theorem simplifies to the prior probabilities:

Thus:

\[ P(C|B) = P(C) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
