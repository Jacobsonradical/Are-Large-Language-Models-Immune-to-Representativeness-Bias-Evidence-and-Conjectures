To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, our hypothesis \( H_{CS} \) is that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H_{Hum}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the total sample size is 100 professors, with 75 from computer science and 25 from humanities, we have:
- \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H_{Hum}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H_{Hum}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

We recognize that the description of Jason seems to align more with typical traits associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). Therefore, let's assume:
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) = 0.2 \) (assuming it is less probable for a computer science professor to have these traits)
- \( P(D | H_{Hum}) = 0.8 \) (assuming it is more probable for a humanities professor to have these traits)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{Hum}) \cdot P(H_{Hum}) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_{CS} | D) \):

\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.4286"}
