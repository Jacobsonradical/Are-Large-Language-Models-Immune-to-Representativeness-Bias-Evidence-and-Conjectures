To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \): Probability of selecting a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): Probability of selecting a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood of the Description:**
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) \): Probability of the description given a computer science professor (difficult to compute exactly, but intuitively this description seems less likely for a computer science professor)
   - \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \): Probability of the description given a humanities professor (this description seems more likely for a humanities professor)

For simplicity, we will assume rough estimates for these likelihoods based on typical associations with the given traits:
   - Let’s assume \( P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.2 \) (i.e., 20% chance this description matches a CS professor)
   - Let’s assume \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 0.8 \) (i.e., 80% chance this description matches a humanities professor)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{(0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.2}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{15}{35} = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
```json
{"probability": "0.4286"}
