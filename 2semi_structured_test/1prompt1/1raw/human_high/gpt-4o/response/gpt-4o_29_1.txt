Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the evidence about Jason's personality traits.

First, define the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(Hum) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, define the likelihoods:
- \( P(B | CS) \): Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | Hum) \): Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description indicates he is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it's reasonable to assume that such traits are more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. However, without specific numerical values, we'll make some reasonable assumptions:
- \( P(B | CS) \) is low, say 0.2 (indicating it's relatively uncommon for computer science professors to fit this description).
- \( P(B | Hum) \) is high, say 0.8 (indicating it's more common for humanities professors to fit this description).

Now, calculate the total probability of the evidence \( B \):
\[ P(B) = P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{P(B | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(CS | B) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | B) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is approximately:
