To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) \)
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor from the sample is a humanities professor: \( P(H) \)

   Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Define the likelihoods:**
   - Probability of getting a description like Jason's, given that he is a computer science professor: \( P(D | CS) \)
   - Probability of getting a description like Jason's, given that he is a humanities professor: \( P(D | H) \)

   Suppose descriptions like Jason's are more likely in humanities than in computer science. Let's assume \( P(D | H) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D | CS) \). For the sake of example, let's assume:
   \[ P(D | CS) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(D | H) = 0.8 \]

3. **Compute the total probability of the description:**
   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.075 + 0.2 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.275 \]

4. **Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.275} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.075}{0.275} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{75}{275} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) = \frac{15}{55} \]
   \[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.2727 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.2727.
