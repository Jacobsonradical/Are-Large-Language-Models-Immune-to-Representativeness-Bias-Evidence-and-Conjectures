Based on the information provided:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We have a personality description of Jason, who is described as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, not particularly technical.

Given the relatively small sample size and the detailed personality traits, we can utilize Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. The theorem calculates the posterior probability based on prior probability and likelihoods.

However, there is no explicit likelihood function provided, only the descriptions which are somewhat subjective. In this scenario, using prior probabilities will be our best estimation tool.

1. Prior probability:
   - For a computer science professor \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - For a humanities professor \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. Likelihood given the personality description:
   - Without detailed likelihood values, we'll make a reasoned assumption. Jason's description fits more traditionally with a humanities profile due to the focus on creativity, imagination, and emotionality, which is less commonly associated with technical fields like computer science.

Since we don't have exact likelihood values to adjust our priors, we lean on our intuition and subjective judgment:
   - Let's assume the probability of this description fitting a humanities professor \( P(Desc|Hum) \approx 0.7 \)
   - And the probability of this description fitting a computer science professor \( P(Desc|CS) \approx 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \times P(Hum)} \]

Substitute:
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.75}{0.3 \times 0.75 + 0.7 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.175} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.4} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = 0.5625 \]

Therefore, the computed probability is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.56"} \]
