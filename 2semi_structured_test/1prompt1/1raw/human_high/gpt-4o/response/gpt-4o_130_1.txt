Sure, let's compute the probability using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
Similarly,
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same in both cases, we only really need to compute \( P(D|C) \cdot P(C) \) and \( P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \) to compare them. Because we don't have the exact values for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we rely on Bayesian reasoning:

Given the description of Jason (emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, enjoys traveling and reading, not particularly technical), it more closely matches the typical attributes of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, suggesting \( P(D|H) > P(D|C) \).

However, we can still use the base rates to factor in the initial likelihoods.

Since there are three times as many computer science professors as humanities professors in the sample (75 vs. 25), even if the description fits a humanities professor better, the base rate still impacts the final probability significantly.

Without specific probabilities for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), but knowing \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \), and intuiting that the description fits humanities professors better, let's estimate:

Given:
- Base likelihood: 3 times as many CS as humanities professors.
- Description fits humanities better.

A reasonable estimate might be that the description double counts toward humanities professors versus an even count.

Therefore:
- Estimated \( P(D|C) \): Baseline (1).
- Estimated \( P(D|H) \): Double Baseline (2).

Then estimate:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 2 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.5} = \frac{0.75}{1.25} = 0.6 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.6"}
