First, we need to consider the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample. We have:

- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

The total number of professors is 100.

This gives us the prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we examine Jason's description and match it against typical profiles for each group. Jason is described as:
- Creative and imaginative
- Often emotionally driven
- Enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring
- Gifted and passionate
- Not particularly technical

These traits appear to be more characteristic of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor due to the creative and emotionally driven aspects, along with the fact that he's not particularly technical.

Given that we have no explicit numerical likelihoods, we can use qualitative reasoning to adjust our posterior probability.

Since Jason's traits better fit the humanities profile rather than computer science profile, we will adjust the probabilities more in favor of humanities.

So, let's adjust the probabilities qualitatively while still keeping our priors in mind. Without exact likelihoods and just using the given strong match to the humanities profile, we might reasonably assign a lower probability to Jason being a computer science professor.

Thus, a possible estimated probability for Jason being a computer science professor might be around 0.1, reflecting the stronger match to the humanities profile while acknowledging our prior information.

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.1"}
