To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let’s define our terms:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of drawing Jason’s description.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To solve this, we need to compare \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are the probabilities of a person with Jason's description being from computer science or humanities. Given the description of Jason, who is described as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," these traits seem to fit more closely with the typical profiles of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Therefore, \( P(D) \) (the overall probability of seeing Jason's description) can be found by:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.75) + (0.8 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes’ Theorem equation:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
