To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. The theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A' \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we identify the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need the conditional probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \). These represent the likelihoods of the description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively. Given the description of Jason, which suggests a more humanities-oriented personality, let's assume these probabilities accordingly, noting this as an intuition-based estimation:

- \( P(B|A) \ll P(B|A') \)

Without specific knowledge, assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.2 \) (likelihood of a computer science professor being described this way)
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.8 \) (likelihood of a humanities professor being described this way)

Now, we compute the total probability of the description \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.75 + 0.8 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.2 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, we compute \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.75}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.429 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
