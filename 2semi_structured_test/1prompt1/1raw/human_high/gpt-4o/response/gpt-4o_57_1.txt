To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- 75 professors are from computer science.
- 25 professors are from humanities.
 
Let:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) = The description matches Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description, Jason's characteristics seem more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. Without additional specific probability data, we can reasonably suppose that:
- \( P(D|C) \) is lower (e.g., 0.2) given Jason's description does not align much with a typical computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is higher (e.g., 0.8) given Jason's description aligns well with a typical humanities professor.

Next, we need to compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2) \cdot (0.75) + (0.8) \cdot (0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.2) \cdot (0.75)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{15}{35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{3}{7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.4286.
