To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of having the description provided.

First, we identify the necessary probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from computer science. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of having the description provided given that Jason is a computer science professor. This is hard to quantify definitively, but letâ€™s assume for simplicity that the description is equally likely for both groups (based on generalized reasoning without specific knowledge).

- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of having the description provided. Given that we don't have specific information on how likely such a description is for each group, let's denote:
  
  \( P(B|A) = P(\text{description}|Computer Science}) \)
  \( P(B|\neg A) = P(\text{description}|Humanities}) \)

- We also need to consider the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from the humanities department:
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \]

Since descriptions are equally likely, we can assume:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Therefore, the total probability \( P(B) \) using the Law of Total Probability is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 1.0 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{(1 \cdot 0.75)}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
