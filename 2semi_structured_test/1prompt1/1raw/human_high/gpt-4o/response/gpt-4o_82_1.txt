To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that event A occurs given that B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that event B occurs given that A is true.
- \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \) are the probabilities of events A and B, respectively.

In this problem:
- Event A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- Event B: Jason matches the given description.

We need:
1. \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
2. \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
3. \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor matches Jason's description.

First, let's reason through these probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): The proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- Probability that Jason matches the given description:
  - It is difficult to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B| \neg A) \) (probability of the description among computer science and non-computer science professors) without further information. However, since Jason's description is more aligned with a humanities profile (creative, emotionally driven, not technical), we can estimate.

For simplicity and based on qualitative reasoning:
- Let’s assume \( P(B| \text{CS}) = 0.1 \) (10% of computer science professors fit this description).
- \( P(B| \text{Humanities}) \): Assume it's higher because the description fits better with humanities’ traits. Let’s assume \( P(B| \text{Humanities}) = 0.7 \) (70% of humanities professors fit this description).

Hence:
\[ P(B) = P(B| \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B| \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1) \cdot (0.75) + (0.7) \cdot (0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.075 + 0.175 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.75}{0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = \frac{0.075}{0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | B) = 0.3 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.3 \).
