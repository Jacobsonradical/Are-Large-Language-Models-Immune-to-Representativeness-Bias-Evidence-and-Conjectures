To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description, we need to find the likelihood that Jason is a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- \(C\): being a computer science professor
- \(H\): being a humanities professor

We need to find \(P(C \mid D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Letâ€™s break this down step by step:

1. **Prior probabilities \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods \(P(D \mid C)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\):**
   - This is the tricky part because based on the description, we need to judge how likely it is that Jason fits into each group. The description given fits more the profile typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

3. **Posterior probability \(P(C \mid D)\)**:
   - We don't know precise likelihoods, but we can make a reasonable assumption. If we assume that Jason is 4 times more likely to be a humanities professor based on the description, then:

\[ P(D \mid C) = \frac{1}{5} \]
\[ P(D \mid H) = \frac{4}{5} \]

Now combining these:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 0.75\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5} \times 0.25\right) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35 \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{(1/5) \times 0.75}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.15}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.428571. Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.43"}
