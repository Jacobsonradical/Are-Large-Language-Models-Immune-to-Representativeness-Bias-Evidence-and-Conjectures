To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of our approach:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability of picking a computer science professor at random, \( P(CS) \), is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The probability of picking a humanities professor at random, \( P(H) \), is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Since the description has been chosen at random and we have no specific information favoring either group based on the description alone, we can consider the likelihood of finding a description like Jason's equally probable in both groups. Therefore, we assume:
\[
P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
\]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), given by:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), we can simplify the equation to:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
\]

Substitute the prior probabilities:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
