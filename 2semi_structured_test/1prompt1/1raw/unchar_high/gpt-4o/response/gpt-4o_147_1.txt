To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description and the composition of the sample (75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors), we can use a straightforward application of the principles of Bayesian inference.

Given:
- 75 out of 100 professors are in computer science.
- 25 out of 100 professors are in the humanities.

As we do not have any additional specific information that differentiates Jason apart from the existing proportions, we can use these base rates directly.

The probability \( P(CS) \) of selecting a computer science professor at random from the pool is given by the proportion of computer science professors in the entire sample:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the probability \( P(Hum) \) of selecting a humanities professor at random from the pool is given by the proportion of humanities professors in the entire sample:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are given a description that does not provide specific indicators for one discipline over the other, the probabilities will reflect the proportions of the sample.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

So, the response would be formatted as:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
