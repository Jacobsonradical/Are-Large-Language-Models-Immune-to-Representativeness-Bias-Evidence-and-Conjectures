To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science \(P(CS)\) is:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities \(P(Hum)\) is:
   \[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need to identify the likelihood of observing the description given if Jason is from computer science \(P(description | CS)\) and if Jason is from the humanities \(P(description | Hum)\). Since the description doesn't provide any particular bias towards either group based on the information given, we can assume:
   \[ P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Since the likelihoods are considered equal and the only difference lies in the prior probabilities, the posterior probability that Jason is from computer science is:
   \[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

   But given that \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \), the denominator \(P(description)\) becomes:
   \[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
   
   But since \(P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum)\), this becomes irrelevant to the calculation and we can simplify:
   \[
   P(CS | description) = P(CS)
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | description) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability is:
