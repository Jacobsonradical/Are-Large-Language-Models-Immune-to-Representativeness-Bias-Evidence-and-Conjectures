To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. We have the following information:

- The total number of professors interviewed: 100
- The number of computer science professors: 75
- The number of humanities professors: 25

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

Let's simplify some terms:

- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(B) \) is the sum of the probabilities of Jason's description across both groups. However, since we don't have precise conditional probabilities and the description seems neutral and equally likely for both fields, we assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (where \( A^c \) indicates humanities professors) to be roughly equal. Under this equal likelihood, \( P(B) = 1 \).

Assuming \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), they essentially cancel out in the formula. 

Therefore, the probability is mainly driven by the prior probabilities \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
