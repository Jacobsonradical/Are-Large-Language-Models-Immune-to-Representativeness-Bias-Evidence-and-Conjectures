To solve this, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find each part of this formula:

1. \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, we get:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are choosing the description randomly from the 100 available descriptions, we assume that the description can apply equally to professors in both fields. Therefore, we assume:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equally likely, we donâ€™t need their exact values because they will cancel each other out when computing the probabilities.

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we simplify:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|C) \cdot 1 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot 1} = P(C) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
