Given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. 

The relevant quantities are:

1. \(P(CS)\): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the computer science group.
2. \(P(H)\): The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities group.
3. \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of having the given description if the professor is from computer science.
4. \(P(D|H)\): The probability of having the given description if the professor is from humanities.
5. \(P(D)\): The overall probability of having the given description.

For simplicity, let's assume Jason's description does not significantly favor either group based on the limited information provided.

First, we have the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we do not have specific information suggesting that the description is more probable for one field over the other, we can assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Thus, based on Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

And since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), it simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Hence, we have:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{(P(CS) + P(H))} \]

Finally substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
