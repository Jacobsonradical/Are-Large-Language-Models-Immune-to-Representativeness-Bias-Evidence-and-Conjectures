To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description occurring.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Thus:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability that Jason is a humanities professor) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assuming that the description provided does not give any additional information favoring one discipline over the other (i.e., descriptions are equally likely for computer science and humanities professors), we can say:
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are assumed to be equal and thus cancel out in the Bayesian formula, we only need to compare the prior probabilities:

So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
