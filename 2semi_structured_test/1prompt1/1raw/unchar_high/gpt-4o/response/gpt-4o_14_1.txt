To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:
     \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

   - The probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)) is:
     \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Assuming the description does not preferentially indicate either group, calculate the posterior probability:**
   - The description provided does not contain any explicit characteristic that distinctly separates computer science professors from humanities professors. Therefore, we can consider the description equally likely for both groups.

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Let’s denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor as \( CS \), and the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( Hum \).
   - We want \( P(CS|D) \), where \( D \) is the provided description of Jason.

Since we have no distinguishing information in the description \( D \), we rely on the prior probabilities directly:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given the symmetry in the description’s relevance:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) = 1 \]

Thus, the denominator \( P(D) \) is calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.75 + 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \]

So,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
