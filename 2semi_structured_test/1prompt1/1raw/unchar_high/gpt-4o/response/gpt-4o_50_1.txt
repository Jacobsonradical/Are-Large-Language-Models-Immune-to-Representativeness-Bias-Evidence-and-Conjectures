To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason has the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each component:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Therefore:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields:
- \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are both 1 because the description does not specify a field and is equally likely.

Using total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
