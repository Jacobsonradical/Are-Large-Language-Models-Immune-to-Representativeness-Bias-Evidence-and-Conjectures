To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 
First, let's break down the given information:

- Number of computer science professors (C): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

The probability we are interested in is \( P(C \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the description given for Jason. 

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Here are the individual probabilities:

1. **\( P(C) \)** is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **\( P(H) \)** is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **\( P(D \mid C) \)** is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume the description could apply equally to professors in both fields, implying \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \).

4. \( P(D) \), the marginal probability of the description, is:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D \mid H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Given \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \]

With all equal likelihoods:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
