To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

First, we need the following information:

1. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \).
2. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Humanities}) \).

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the study, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we calculate the probability of having the same description for a professor in either group, denoted as \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \). In the absence of specific prior information about how likely Jason's description is for either group, we assume these probabilities are equal. Therefore, we assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \).

We are looking for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups and can be written as:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

And with the assumption earlier that \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) (P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})) \]

Since \( P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities}) = 1 \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \]

Then, using Bayes' theorem again:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
