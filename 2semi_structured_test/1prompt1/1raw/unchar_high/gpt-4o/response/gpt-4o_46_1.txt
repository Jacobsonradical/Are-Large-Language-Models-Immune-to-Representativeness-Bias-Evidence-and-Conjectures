To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let’s define our terms and gather all necessary information.

Given:
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
- There are 25 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
- The total number of professors is 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities).

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his profile. Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason's description.

Given the lack of specific probabilistic information in the profile (i.e., the description doesn’t favor computer science or humanities particularly), we consider the prior probability \( P(A) \), the probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} \).

Similarly, the prior probability of being a humanities professor is \( \frac{25}{100} \).

Besides, the profile (B) given does not provide any information to change these prior probabilities dramatically. Hence, we can reasonably assume that the probability \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|¬A) \) are the same.

This simplifies our calculation:

\[ P(\text{CS professor} | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} | \text{CS professor}) \cdot P(\text{CS professor})}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{humanities professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without additional distinguishing details in the description,

The resulting probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{Jason's description}) = \left(\frac{75}{100}\right) \cdot (\text{Prob description | CS professor}) + \left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \cdot (\text{Prob description | humanities professor}) \]

Assuming an equal likelihood of the description fitting any professor, this aspect eventually cancels out the normalization factor leading to:

\[ P(\text{CS professor} | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1.0} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:
