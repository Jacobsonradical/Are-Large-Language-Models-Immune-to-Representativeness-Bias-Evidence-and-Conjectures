To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and the evidence described.

First, let's state the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- Prior probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- Prior probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider how likely it is that a professor with Jason's description comes from either group. This is subjective without detailed data, but if we assume the description is equally likely for professors in both fields (i.e., it does not give any more weight to one group), we simplify the computation by treating the likelihood of the description for each field as equal.

Therefore:
- P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} 
\]

Since P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H), the probabilities are only scaled by the prior probabilities of selecting each type of professor:
\[ 
P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} 
\]
Replacing with the prior probabilities:
\[ 
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.75}{1} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS | Description) = 0.75 
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
