To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem gives us a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Firstly, we need to define the following:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is from the computer science group.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any randomly selected professor is from the humanities group.
3. \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description for any professor.

Given that we have equal and unbiased information about professors from both groups, let's start by calculating the prior probabilities:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming no specific information about how the description differs between groups, we treat the probability of the description given either group as the same:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) is a normalizing constant, we can ignore it for relative probabilities, and thus use:
\[ P(CS|D) \propto P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) \]
\[ P(H|D) \propto P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Because \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(CS|D) \propto P(CS) \]
\[ P(H|D) \propto P(H) \]

Finally, we normalize these to sum to 1:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
