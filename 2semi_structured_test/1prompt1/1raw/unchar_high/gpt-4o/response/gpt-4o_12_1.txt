To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define Events:**

   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Given Probabilities:**

   - \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - \( P(B) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

3. **We need:**

   - \( P(A| \text{description}) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
   - \( P(B| \text{description}) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**

   For the given description, assuming the descriptions are equally likely for computer science and humanities professors, we have:

   \[
   P(A| \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   And

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{description}|B) \cdot P(B)
   \]

5. **Assumptions:**
   
   If we assume that the descriptions are identically likely irrespective of the field, then \( P(\text{description}|A) = P(\text{description}|B) \).

So \( P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{description}|B) \cdot P(B) \) becomes:

\[
P(\text{description}) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k
\]

Substituting back in Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A| \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75
\]

Since \(\frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \), we conclude the probability is:

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
