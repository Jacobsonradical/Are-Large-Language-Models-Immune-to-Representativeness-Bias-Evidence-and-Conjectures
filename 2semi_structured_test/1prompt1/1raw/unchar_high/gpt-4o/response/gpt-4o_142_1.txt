To start, we need to utilize Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description we have. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given of Jason.

To solve this problem, let's define our terms:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science department.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities department.
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from the computer science department.
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities department.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, assuming that the description of Jason is equally likely among professors from either group (which implies \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \) are equal), we can simplify the equation since the evidence does not strongly suggest otherwise.

Therefore, we use:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be broken into:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Given \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \), cancel out these terms:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75.
