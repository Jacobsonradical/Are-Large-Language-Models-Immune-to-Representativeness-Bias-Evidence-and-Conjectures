To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that he fits a description from the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem gives us a way to update our probability estimates given new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason fits the description given.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's the information we have:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are given a random description from the sample of 100 professors and have no additional information indicating that a description is more likely for one group than the other, we assume that the probability of any professor fitting a given description is uniform across both groups. Thus:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]
This is because every professor in the sample has a description and there's no indication that the sampling of description is biased towards either group.

- \( P(B) \): The probability of picking any given description from the sample, which, since every professor has one description, sums as follows:
\[ P(B) = (P(B|A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)) \]
Substituting the values we get:
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
