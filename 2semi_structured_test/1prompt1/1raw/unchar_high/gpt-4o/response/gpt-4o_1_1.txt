To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information that would significantly alter whether he belongs to either group, we consider the descriptions equally likely for any individual within each group.

3. **Posterior probability:**
   The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is calculated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D) } \]

To find \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given no strong indicators favoring either discipline in the description, we assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \). Let's denote this common likelihood as \( P(D|group) \).

Then,

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|group) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|group) \cdot 0.25 = P(D|group) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|group) \cdot 1 = P(D|group) \]

Because \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), it cancels out in the Bayes' theorem computation:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D|group) } \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|group) \cdot 0.75 }{ P(D|group) } = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.75"\}} \]
