To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( HU \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event that Jason's description is given.

We need to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, since we do not have specific information about the event \( D \), we will assume the descriptions are equally likely for professors in both fields.

Let's consider the prior probabilities:

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming descriptions are equally likely for both groups, \( P(D|CS) = P(D|HU) \), we can simplify our calculation:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HU)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
