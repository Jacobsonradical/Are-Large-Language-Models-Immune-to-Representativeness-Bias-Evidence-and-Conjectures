To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's start with the provided information:

- Total tenured and successful professors in the sample: 100
  - Computer Science professors: 75
  - Humanities professors: 25

We assume each description is equally likely to be chosen.

Let \( \text{CS} \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
Let \( \text{H} \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
Let \( \text{D} \) be the description provided.

We aim to find \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{D}) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{D}) = \frac{P(\text{D} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{D})} \]

Breaking it down:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)  (prior probability of being a humanities professor)
  
We assume the description \( \text{D} \) doesn't offer specific details to favor one field explicitly. Thus, \( P(\text{D} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{D} \mid \text{H}) = 1/100 \). Since there are no additional details to differentiate based on the field, these conditional probabilities are equivalent.

The total probability \( P(\text{D}) \) can be found by combining these conditional probabilities with their respective priors:
  
\[ P(\text{D}) = P(\text{D} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{D} \mid \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

\[ P(\text{D}) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.75 + \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(\text{D}) = \frac{0.75}{100} + \frac{0.25}{100} = \frac{1}{100} \]

Since the description \( \text{D} \) provides no specific distinguishing detail:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{D}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
