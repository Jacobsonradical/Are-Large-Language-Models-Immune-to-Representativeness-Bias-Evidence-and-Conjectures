To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in our context can be framed as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

However, given that we only have raw counts of the two groups (computer science and humanities professors) without any specific probability deviations based on the description, we can simplify this to basic probability estimation based on the counts in the sample.

We have:
- \(P(A_{cs})\): the prior probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor.
- \(P(A_hum)\): the prior probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor.
- \(P(B|A_{cs})\): the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor (assumed equal as description is given randomly from the same pool).
- \(P(B|A_hum)\): the likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor (assumed equal as description is given randomly from the same pool).
- \(P(B)\): the marginal probability of the description (not needed as same in both cases).

We know:
- Number of computer science professors, \(n_{cs} = 75\)
- Number of humanities professors, \(n_{hum} = 25\)
- Total professors, \(n_{total} = 75 + 25 = 100\)

Thus:
- \(P(A_{cs}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(A_hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Since the descriptions are randomly selected and we have no reason to believe the description's source otherwise, the P(B|A) terms can be simplified as equivalent because the methods of selection imply equal distribution.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[
P(A_{cs}|B) = \frac{P(B | A_{cs}) \cdot P(A_{cs})}{P(B)}
             = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{\frac{1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25}{100}} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
