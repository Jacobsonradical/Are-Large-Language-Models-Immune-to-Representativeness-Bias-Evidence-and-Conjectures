To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Given description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

We'll assume the description of Jason is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors, meaning \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \). In that case, the formula simplifies, and we basically consider the base rates:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \):

\[
P(C | D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
