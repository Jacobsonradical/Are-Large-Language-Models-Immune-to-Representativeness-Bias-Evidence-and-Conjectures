To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events. 

Here are the relevant pieces of information:

- Total number of professors = 100
- Number of computer science professors = 75
- Number of humanities professors = 25

We are given a description of Jason and asked to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors. 

We can denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( HUM \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event that we have the given description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(HUM) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | HUM) \) is the probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Assuming that the description does not significantly favor one discipline over the other (it is equally likely for both disciplines), then \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HUM) \) can be assumed to be the same.

Thus, for simplicity, we set \( P(D | CS) = P(D | HUM) = k \) (a constant).

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

Since \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HUM) \) are assumed equal:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(HUM) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Substituting back in the Bayes' formula:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{ k \cdot 0.75 }{ k } = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:
