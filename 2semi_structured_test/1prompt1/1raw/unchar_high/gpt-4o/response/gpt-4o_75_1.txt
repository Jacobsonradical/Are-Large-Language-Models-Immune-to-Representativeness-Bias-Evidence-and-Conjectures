To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the given sample based on the description and the information provided, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 100.

We are looking to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of a professor being in computer science.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given the professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since we have no detail about the difference in the descriptions specific to whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Then the probability is directly proportional to the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(CS|D) \) is just:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The answer can be given as:

{"probability": "0.75"}
