To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events as follows:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\): The description provided matches Jason

We are given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\): The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\): The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor

We want to calculate \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. We will use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's assume the description is equally likely for both groups, so:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1 \]

The denominator, \(P(D)\), can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \(P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1\):

\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, we calculate \(P(C|D)\):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
