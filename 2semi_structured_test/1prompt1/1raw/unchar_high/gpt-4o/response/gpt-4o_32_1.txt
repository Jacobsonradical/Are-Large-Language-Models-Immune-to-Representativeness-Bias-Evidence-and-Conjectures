To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the given data and the computation step-by-step:

1. Total number of professors: 100
   - Computer Science (CS) professors: 75
   - Humanities professors: 25

2. We need to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \):

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For our problem:
- A = Jason is a CS professor
- B = Jason's description

So we need:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Let's work with the components:
1. \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a CS professor:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(\text{Humanities}) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a Humanities professor:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(\text{description}) \): This is the total probability of the description given. Since the description does not provide specific details distinguishing between the two groups, we will assume this description could equally likely be associated with both groups. Thus:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Assuming that \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) are similar because there's no distinguishing feature, they can be treated as comparable. Therefore, equivalently use:
\[ P(\text{description}) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]
where \( k \) is a constant that normalizes probabilities.

4. \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \):
\[ P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = k \]

Given that both \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) describe similar qualities:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
