To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We are asked to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We will begin by computing \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Hence, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the descriptions are equally likely to be written for professors in either field, so:

- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)

Given the equal likelihood, the total probability \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), let \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = p \).

\[ P(D) = p \cdot P(C) + p \cdot P(H) = p \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = p \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = p \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{p \cdot 0.75}{p} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
