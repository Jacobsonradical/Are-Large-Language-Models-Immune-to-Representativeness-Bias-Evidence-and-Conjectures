Let's analyze the problem using Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total, so \( P(CS) = 0.75 \).
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors total, so \( P(H) = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The description given doesn't provide any specific information that increases or decreases the likelihood of Jason belonging to either group, so we assume the likelihood of Jason’s description being that of a computer science professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) is the same as the likelihood of Jason’s description being that of a humanities professor (\( P(D|H) \)). Therefore, we assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

3. **Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem Calculation)**:

   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), the denominator \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) can be simplified:

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]
   
   Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), let this be \( P(D) \). Then, the equation simplifies to:

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times 0.75 + P(D|CS) \times 0.25 = P(D|CS)
   \]

   Therefore, the posterior probability is just the prior probability for a computer science professor.

   \[
   P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.75
   \]

So, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
