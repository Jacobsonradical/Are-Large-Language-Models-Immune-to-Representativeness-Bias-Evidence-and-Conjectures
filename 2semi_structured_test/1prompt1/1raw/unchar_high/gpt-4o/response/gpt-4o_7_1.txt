To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to compute the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors (CS)
- 25 humanities professors (H)

The description does not provide specific details that would help distinguish between a CS professor and a humanities professor, so we assume there's no particular bias in the description towards either group.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) be the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) be the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|A) \) be the probability of drawing such a description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \) be the probability of drawing such a description if Jason is a humanities professor.

The proportion of CS professors in the sample is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The proportion of humanities professors in the sample is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we assume the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(D|A) = P(D|B) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) \),
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = P(D|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|A) \cdot 0.25 = P(D|A) \]

Thus,
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|A)} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
