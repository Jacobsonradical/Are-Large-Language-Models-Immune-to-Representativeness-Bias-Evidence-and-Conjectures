To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which involves the following components:

- The prior probabilities:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- The likelihoods and evidence are tricky to determine precisely because we don't have specific likelihood ratios from the given description. However, if we assume there's no inherent bias in the description favoring either group, we can simplify the problem.

Bayes' theorem formula for the probability \( P(CS|D) \) given description \( D \) is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)} \]

Given that \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|HUM) \), the probabilities simplify to:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(HUM)} \]

In this simplified context:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{1} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.75.
