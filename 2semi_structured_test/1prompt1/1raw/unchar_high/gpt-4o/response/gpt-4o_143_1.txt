To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to determine:

- The total number of professors: 100 (75 in computer science + 25 in humanities).
- The probability of randomly picking a professor based on the fields: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) for computer science and \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) for humanities.
- Since the description does not provide any specific detail that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the likelihood of providing the given description is equally probable for both groups.

Given these assumptions, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS|D) \), can be computed as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) }{ P(D) } \]

Since the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|Hum) \) are presumably equal, we simplify this as:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|Hum) \]

Therefore,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{ P(CS) }{ P(CS) + P(Hum) } = \frac{ 0.75 }{ 0.75 + 0.25 } = \frac{ 0.75 }{ 1 } = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
