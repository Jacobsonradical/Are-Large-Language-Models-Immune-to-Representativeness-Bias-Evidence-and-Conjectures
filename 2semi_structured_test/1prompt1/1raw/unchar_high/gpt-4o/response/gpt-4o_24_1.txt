To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description of Jason given.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is:
\[ P(C) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from humanities, which is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

For simplicity and due to the randomness of the single description, we assume that \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \). This assumption simplifies our problem under the condition of no additional specific information favoring one group over the other based on the description given.

Therefore, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Due to our assumption:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Hence, \( P(D) \) simplifies as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|C) \cdot P(H) = P(D|C) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|C) \cdot 1 \rightarrow P(D) = P(D|C) \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
