To solve this probability question, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Here's how Bayes' Theorem is applied in this context:

Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

1. **Prior probabilities:**
    \[
    P(C) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]
    \[
    P(H) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   These are the probabilities of the description given the category of professor. Since the description is a generic one that equally fits both computer science and humanities professors, we will assume:
    \[
    P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) = 1
    \]

3. **Normalization constant:** This is the total probability of the description \( D \):
    \[
    P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 1
    \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).

The answer to the question is: 

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
