To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We know the following:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Jason is one of the 100 professors described.

We want to find P(CS | Jason), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]

Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **P(CS)**: The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **P(H)**: The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **P(Jason | CS)** and **P(Jason | H)**: These would be the likelihoods of Jason’s description given he's in either field. Given the description alone and no additional information, we can assume that these probabilities are equal (the description is not biased towards either field). Therefore, we assume:
\[ P(Jason | CS) = P(Jason | H) \]

Since P(Jason | CS) and P(Jason | H) are equal and thus cancel out in the Bayes' Theorem ratio, we only need to consider the prior probabilities.

4. **P(Jason)**: The total probability of randomly selecting Jason's description from the given sample.
\[ P(Jason) = P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Jason) = P(Jason | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(Jason | H) \cdot 0.25 \] 
Given P(Jason | CS) = P(Jason | H), their exact values will cancel out in the ratio.

So, simplifying Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]
\[ = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(Jason | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(Jason | H) \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
