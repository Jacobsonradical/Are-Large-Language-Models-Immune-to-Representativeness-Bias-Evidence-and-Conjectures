To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define our terms:

- \( A \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description we have of Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's how we can define each term:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of getting Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of getting Jason's description.

First, let's determine the priors:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Similarly, the probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since we have no other specific information about how the descriptions were crafted based on the field of expertise and given the lack of distinguishing features between fields:

\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \]

Let's assume the description is equally likely for both groups:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \approx 1 \)

At this point:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) \approx 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.75"} \]
