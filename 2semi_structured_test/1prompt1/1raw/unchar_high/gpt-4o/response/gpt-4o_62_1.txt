To determine the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the description of Jason, we need to find the probability that he is one of the computer science professors (let's denote this event as \( C \)), given the description.

We know the following:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Using the information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, without additional information to differentiate the description probability \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we assume that a professor fitting this description is equally likely to be found in both fields:

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):

\[ P(D) = x \cdot 0.75 + x \cdot 0.25 = x (0.75 + 0.25) = x \]

Thus, \( P(D) = x \), and the exact probability values cancel each other out in:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
