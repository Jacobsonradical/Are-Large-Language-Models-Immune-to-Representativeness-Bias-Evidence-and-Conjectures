To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (let's denote this event as \(A\)) given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's lay out the necessary components:

1. The total number of professors interviewed is 100 (75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities).
2. We are given a random description of one individual out of these 100.

Bayes' theorem is represented as:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the problem statement, we don't have specific details on how likely Jason's description is for each group separately. We assume the description is equally likely for any professor due to lack of information indicating otherwise. So, we consider:

1. \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the prior probability of picking a computer science professor.
2. \( P(\text{not } A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the prior probability of picking a humanities professor.

Since the description is assumed to be equally likely in both groups (no given discriminative information), we simplify:

\[ P(B \mid A) = P(B \mid \text{not } A) = 1 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B \mid A) = P(B \mid \text{not } A) \) and given no specific probability, they cancel out:

\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1 \]

Thus:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
