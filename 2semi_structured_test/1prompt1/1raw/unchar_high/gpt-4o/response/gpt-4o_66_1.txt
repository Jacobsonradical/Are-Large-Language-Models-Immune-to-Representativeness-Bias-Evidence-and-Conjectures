To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on the given information.

Here are the pieces of given information:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
- You randomly pick one description out of 100.

The probabilities we need to consider are:
- The prior probability of picking a CS professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability of picking an H professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Given the description, we must calculate the posterior probability, \( P(CS|D) \), where \( D \) is the description. However, because the description does not provide a specific marker to distinguish between CS and H professors, we will consider them equally likely to fit such a description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since every professor has an equal likelihood of fitting the description, \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal. We can say:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = P(D) \]

So, the equation simplifies to considering just the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
