To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimates given new evidence.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors
- Total of 100 professors

The probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability \( P(Hum) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is:
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

We aim to compute \( P(CS|B) \).

Assuming these descriptions (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, positive reputation) are equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors:
\[ P(B|CS) = P(B|Hum) = \frac{1}{100} \]

Then we compute the numerator of Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.75 = \frac{0.75}{100} \]

Similarly, for humanities professors:
\[ P(B|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.25 = \frac{0.25}{100} \]

The denominator \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description, which is the sum of the numerators for both groups:
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.75}{100} + \frac{0.25}{100} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{0.75}{100}}{0.01} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is 0.75.

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
