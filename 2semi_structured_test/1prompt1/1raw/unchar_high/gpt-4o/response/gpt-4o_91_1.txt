To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The given description matches Jason.

We need to find \(P(CS | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we start with the base rates:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:

\[P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\]

\[P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\]

Next, we need the likelihoods of the description \(D\) given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Since we don't have specific information on how often such descriptions fit professors in either category, we assume that the description is equally likely for both groups, so:

\[P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\]

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

And since \(P(D)\) can be derived from the total probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Assuming \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\):

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.25 = P(D | CS) \cdot 1 = P(D | CS)
\]

So:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)}
\]

Since \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\), they cancel each other out, leading to:

\[
P(CS | D) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
