To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

To compute \( P(A|D) \), we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B) \): The prior probability of being a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|B) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the numbers in the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors \( n = 100 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To compute \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Assuming the description \( D \) is equally likely for professors in both disciplines:

\[ P(D|A) = P(D|B) \]

Since the description does not favor one discipline over the other, let's assume \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) = k \). This means:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = k (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.75k}{k} \]
\[ P(A|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \) or 75%.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
