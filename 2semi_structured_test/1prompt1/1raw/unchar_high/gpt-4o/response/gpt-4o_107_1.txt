To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the given description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the given description occurring among all professors.

To apply Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   There are 75 computer science professors and 100 total professors.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Event Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**:
   There are 25 humanities professors.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Description Probability \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   Since the description does not give specific details that would clearly differentiate between computer science and humanities professors (e.g., specific academic interests or teaching styles), we assume that the description is equally likely among both groups. Hence:
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = \frac{1}{100} \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   This is the weighted average of the probabilities of the description, considering both groups:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)(0.75) + \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)(0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = \frac{0.75}{100} + \frac{0.25}{100} \]
   \[ P(B) = \frac{1}{100} \]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)(0.75)}{\frac{1}{100}} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
