To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Given:
- \(P(A)\): prior probability that a professor is from computer science = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(B)\): probability of selecting a description (This is irrelevant since it remains the same for all calculations and thus cancels out)
- \(P(B|A)\): probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
- \(P(B|C)\): probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor
- \(P(C)\): prior probability that a professor is from the humanities = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Without additional information to differentiate the descriptions provided by discipline, we assume that the description being equally likely for computer science and humanities professors. This assumption means \(P(B|A) = P(B|C)\).

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|C) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|C) \cdot P(C) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 \] 
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A)} = 0.75 \]

So, based on the given information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
