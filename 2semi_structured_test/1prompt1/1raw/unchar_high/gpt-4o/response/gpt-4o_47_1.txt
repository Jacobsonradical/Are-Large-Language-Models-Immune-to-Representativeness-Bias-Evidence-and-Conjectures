To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the probability of a hypothesis before (prior probability) and after evidence (posterior probability).

Given:
- The total number of professors (T) = 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100.
- The number of computer science professors (C) = 75.
- The number of humanities professors (H) = 25.

The probability we are interested in is P(C | description of Jason), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We assume that the description is just as likely to describe a computer science professor as it is to describe a humanities professor due to no specific distinguishing characteristics in the given information about Jason's academic field. This simplifies the calculation as P(description | C) and P(description | H) are considered equal.

Thus, we use the base rates of computer science and humanities professors, i.e., the prior probabilities:
- P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
- P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25

Given P(description | C) = P(description | H), the ratio of the base rates provides the probability directly. Therefore, P(description) can be simplified out since it does not affect the relative strength of P(description | C) compared to P(description | H).

Thus:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
