To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We'll utilize the given information to find the posterior probability.

Here is the setup:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is 100.

Given that a description is chosen at random from these 100 descriptions, the chances of picking a computer science professor's description \( P(\text{CS}) \) and a humanities professor's description \( P(\text{H}) \) are as follows:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now we need to look at the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we are looking to find:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) \]

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Given that the descriptions are chosen randomly and uniformly across both groups, we can assume:
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) = \frac{1}{75} \)
- \( P(\text{description}|\text{H}) = \frac{1}{25} \)

The overall probability of picking Jason's description, \( P(\text{description}) \), can be split into two parts:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ P(\text{description}) = \left(\frac{1}{75} \cdot 0.75\right) + \left(\frac{1}{25} \cdot 0.25\right) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = \left(\frac{0.75}{75}\right) + \left(\frac{0.25}{25}\right) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} = \frac{0.01}{1} = 0.01 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{\frac{1}{75} \cdot 0.75}{0.01} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{0.01}{0.01} = 1 \]

Given the assumptions and calculations, this implies 100% confidence under the uniform and random description choice model. However, if we revisit the scenario without over-relying on the uniform likelihood of description fit, we follow the base rates:
- That is likely to be a misstep in reasoning. We revisit the base rates, absent further specific variance on descriptiveness causing over specificity on CS fitment given base rates.

So, we probabilistically rerate:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{total})} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the updated and appropriate representation numerically computed is:
