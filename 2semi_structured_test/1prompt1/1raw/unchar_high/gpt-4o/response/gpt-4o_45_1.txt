To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is one of the 75 computer science professors.
- \( B \): Jason is one of the 25 humanities professors.

We know:
- P(A) = 75/100 = 0.75
- P(B) = 25/100 = 0.25

Since we are given a description, we assume we have no additional information that makes the descriptions more likely to come from either group. Thus, the descriptions are equally likely for either group given this information.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{P(A | Description)} = \frac{\text{P(Description | A) P(A)}}{\text{P(Description)}} \]
\[ \text{P(B | Description)} = \frac{\text{P(Description | B) P(B)}}{\text{P(Description)}} \]

Given the descriptions are equally likely:
\[ \text{P(Description | A)} = \text{P(Description | B)} \]

Consequently:
\[ \text{P(A | Description)} = \frac{\text{P(A)}}{\text{P(A) + P(B)}} \]

Let's compute it:
\[ \text{P(A | Description)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
