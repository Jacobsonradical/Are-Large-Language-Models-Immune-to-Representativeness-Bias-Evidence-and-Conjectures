To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Total number of professors**: 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100
2. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS))**: 
   \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
3. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(H))**: 
   \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the descriptions for both groups are relatively similar because we have no information suggesting otherwise. Therefore, the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) (probability of the description given the professor is in computer science) and \( P(D|H) \) (probability of the description given the professor is in humanities) can be considered equal.

4. **Using Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)}
   \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal, they cancel out in the proportions, so the posterior probability is the same as the prior ratio:

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
