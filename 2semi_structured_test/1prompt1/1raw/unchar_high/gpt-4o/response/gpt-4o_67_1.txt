To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities**:
   - Total number of professors in computer science: 75
   - Total number of professors in humanities: 25
   - Total number of professors overall: 100

   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:
   \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

   The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is:
   \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Calculate Posterior Probabilities**:
   - Assume the description is equally likely for professors in both fields since the description provided does not preferentially describe someone more likely to be in computer science or humanities.

   Therefore, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(desc|CS) \)) is:
   \( P(desc|CS) = 1 \)

   Similarly, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(desc|H) \)) is:
   \( P(desc|H) = 1 \)

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem formula for computing the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\( P(CS|desc) \)) is:
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(desc)}
   \]

   Where \( P(desc) \) is the overall probability of the description. Since the description is equally likely across both groups:
   \[
   P(desc) = P(desc|CS) \times P(CS) + P(desc|H) \times P(H)
   \]
   Given \( P(desc|CS) = 1 \) and \( P(desc|H) = 1 \):
   \[
   P(desc) = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 1
   \]

   Thus:
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
