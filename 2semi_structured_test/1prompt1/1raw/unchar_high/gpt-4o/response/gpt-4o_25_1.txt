To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us calculate the probability of a hypothesis given some observed evidence.

Given:
- Total professors: 100 (75 computer science + 25 humanities)
- We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define our events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | C) \): Likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

1. **Calculate \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):**
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Assume \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \):**
Given no specific information that distinguishes between description likelihoods for computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the description \( D \) is equally likely for both groups.
\[ P(D | C) = P(D | H) \]

3. **Calculate \( P(D) \):**
Since \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are assumed to be equal:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k(0.75 + 0.25) = k \]
Here \( k \) represents \( P(D | C) \) or \( P(D | H) \).

4. **Calculate \( P(C | D) \):**
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
