To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(H) \) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We assume that the description is equally likely to be chosen for anyone in the cohort because the description does not provide information specific to one group. Hence,
- \( P(D | CS) \) = \(\frac{1}{100}\)
- \( P(D | H) \) = \(\frac{1}{100}\)

Now, to compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.75 + \frac{1}{100} \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{1}{100} \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{1}{100} \]

Since this calculation simplifies the problem unrealistically (considering we used an identical likelihood for descriptions across the board), let's double-check:

The correct approach would be:

Given all assumptions and the description as it is (without creating any differentiation):

Finally, Bayes' theorem simplifies with equal likelihoods:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Simplifying further:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
