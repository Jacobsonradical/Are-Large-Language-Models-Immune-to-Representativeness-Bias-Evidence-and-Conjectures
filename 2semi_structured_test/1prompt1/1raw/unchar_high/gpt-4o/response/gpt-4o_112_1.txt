To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Given description of Jason.

What we need to find is \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We can break this down step by step.

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **P(B|A)**: The probability of Jason having his description given that he is a computer science professor. 

3. **P(B)**: The total probability of the given description. This is a bit complex but can be broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \]

Since the description does not provide specific information that helps to differentiate between the two groups, we can assume that descriptions are equally likely (same \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \)) given motivation, high ability, and positive reputation are common traits among successful professors in both fields.

Therefore:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

Plugging in Bayes' Theorem, assuming equal likelihood of the description whether Jason is from computer science or humanities:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Both \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) cancel out, resulting in:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
