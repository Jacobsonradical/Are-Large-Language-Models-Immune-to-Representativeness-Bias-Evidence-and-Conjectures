To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( A_1 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( A_2 \)).
- The prior probabilities are \( P(A_1) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(A_2) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need \( P(B|A_1) \) and \( P(B|A_2) \). Since the description is randomly chosen and doesn't specify any distinguishing characteristics, assume the chances of the description fitting either group are equal. So we consider the probabilities of the descriptions \( B \) given someone is from either group to be the same.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) \]

So:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]

Since \( P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) \), let's denote this common probability as \( P(B|A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A_1) + P(A_2)) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A)} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 

\[ \boxed{0.75} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
