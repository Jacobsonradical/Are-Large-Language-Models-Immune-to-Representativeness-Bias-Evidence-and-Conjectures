To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how to approach the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(\text{CS}) \)) is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
    - \[
    P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
    \]
    - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(\text{H}) \)) is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
    - \[
    P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
    \]

2. **Likelihood**:
    - Given the description, we need to estimate the likelihood of this description being for a computer science professor (\( P(D|\text{CS}) \)) versus a humanities professor (\( P(D|\text{H}) \)). Since the description contains very general information without specific indicators to distinguish between the two fields, we'll assume that it is equally likely to be a description of any professor regardless of the field, i.e.,
    - \[
    P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H})
    \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
    - Applying Bayes' theorem:
    - \[
    P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{ P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(D) }
    \]
    - We know \( P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \), but since \( P(D|\text{CS}) = P(D|\text{H}) \), these terms cancel out.
    - Thus, the posterior probability simplifies to:
    - \[
    P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
    \]
    - Substituting the values:
    - \[
    P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
    \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
