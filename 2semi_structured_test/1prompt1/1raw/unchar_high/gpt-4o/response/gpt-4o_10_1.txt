First, let's determine the base rates (or prior probabilities) for each group in the sample:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is:
\[ 75 + 25 = 100 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given the description of Jason, and without any specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we will use the base rates to calculate the probability:

Because we do not have any additional evidence that favors one group over the other, we rely on the base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is simply the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, which is 0.75.

Answer:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
