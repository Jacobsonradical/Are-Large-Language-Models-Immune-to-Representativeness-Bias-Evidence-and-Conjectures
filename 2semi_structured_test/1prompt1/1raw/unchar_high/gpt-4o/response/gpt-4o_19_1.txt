To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

We define the events as follows:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We want to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We have:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming that the descriptions are made without bias to favor either group (i.e., they are equally likely to describe a computer science or humanities professor), we can consider that \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are roughly equal. Therefore, \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \).

Since we are considering probability from descriptions that were uniformly and randomly chosen, we could assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Thus, \( P(D) \) (the overall probability of any given description being picked) is given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

If \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), both terms will be about equal scaled by their respective priors (0.75 and 0.25).

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
Since we assumed \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \), we get:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Therefore, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|CS)} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the final probability is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]

Which completes our calculation for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
