To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can compute it step by step.

Given:
- 75 tenured and successful computer science professors (CS)
- 25 tenured and successful humanities professors (H)

Total: 100 professors

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description (regardless of the field).

1. **Prior Probability**:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   Since the description given does not favor either group with specific traits more common in one field, we will assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \). For simplicity, let's set both to 1 (assuming equal likelihood for both disciplines given no clear differentiation).

3. **Overall Probability (Normalization Constant)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
