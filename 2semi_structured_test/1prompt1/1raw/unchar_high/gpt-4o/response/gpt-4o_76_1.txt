To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here is the process:

1. **Total professors**: 75 (computer science) + 25 (humanities) = 100.

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\(P(\text{CS})\)) = 75/100 = 0.75.
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (\(P(\text{H})\)) = 25/100 = 0.25.

3. **Likelihood**: We assume the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor as a humanities professor since we don't have specific information favoring one group more than the other.

4. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \(P(\text{Description})\) is:

\[ 
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
\]

Since the description likelihood (\(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS})\) and \(P(\text{Description}|\text{H})\)) are the same:

\[ 
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
\]

Since \(P(\text{CS}) = 0.75\) and \( P(\text{H}) = 0.25 \):

\[ 
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
