To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we should use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D | H) \) = Probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can use the law of total probability for \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the probability of getting the given description, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), is equal for both disciplines, we can simplify the calculation. Let's denote this probability as \( P(D) \).

Thus, we have:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D) \cdot 0.75 + P(D) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D) \]

The probabilities \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) cancel out because they are equal.

Thus:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
