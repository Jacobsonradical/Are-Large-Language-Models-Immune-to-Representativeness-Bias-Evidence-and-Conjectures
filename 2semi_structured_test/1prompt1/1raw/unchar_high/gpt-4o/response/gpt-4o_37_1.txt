To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group.
2. \( P(\text{H}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group.
3. \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \): The probability of seeing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \): The probability of seeing Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**1. Prior Probabilities:**
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

**2. Assumed Likelihoods:**
Since we don't have specific likelihood information, we'll assume Jason's description is equally likely for professors in both groups.
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) = 1 \]

**3. Total Probability of the Description:**
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

**4. Posterior Probability:**
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}} \]
