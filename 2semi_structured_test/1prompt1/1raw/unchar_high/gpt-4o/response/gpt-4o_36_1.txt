To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100.
   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100.

   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\), and the prior probability that he is a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Since the description does not provide any specific distinguishing traits that favor either discipline over the other, we assume that the likelihood of receiving such a description is the same for both computer science and humanities professors.

3. **Posterior Probability** (Bayes' Theorem):
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is proportional to the likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor multiplied by the prior probability.
   - Similarly for a humanities professor.

   Since the likelihood for both is the same and doesn't affect our computation, we only consider the prior probabilities.

So:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Because \(P(\text{Description} | CS)\) and \(P(\text{Description} | Hum)\) are equal, they cancel out, and we use the prior probabilities directly:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)}
\]

Plugging the numbers in:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75  
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
