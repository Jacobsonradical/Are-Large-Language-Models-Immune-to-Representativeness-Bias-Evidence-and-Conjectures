To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that he is a tenured and successful professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - Number of computer science professors (\( C_s \)): 75
    - Number of humanities professors (\( H \)): 25
    - Total number of professors: 100

    Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
    - \( P(C_s) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
    - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
    - We need to assess whether Jason fits a typical description of professors in computer science or humanities. Since the description doesn't overtly favor one group over the other, we assume the likelihood of receiving this description is equal for both groups. This simplifies our problem since \( P(Description | C_s) = P(Description | H) \), which cancels out in Bayesian computation.

3. **Posterior probability**:
    - \( P(C_s | Description) = \frac{P(Description | C_s) * P(C_s)}{P(Description)} \)
    - Since \( P(Description | C_s) = P(Description | H) \):
    - \( P(C_s | Description) = \frac{P(C_s)}{P(C_s) + P(H)} \)

Given our prior probabilities:
    - \( P(C_s | Description) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
