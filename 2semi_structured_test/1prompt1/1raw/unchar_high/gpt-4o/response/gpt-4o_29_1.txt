To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Initially, we need to consider the number of professors in each sample and then update this with the given description.

In this case:
- The number of computer science professors (CS) = 75
- The number of humanities professors = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

Given that we have no reason to believe the description favors one group over the other based on the information provided, and assuming descriptions are equally likely to be about any person in the study, we apply:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Here:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming descriptions do not provide new distinguishing information:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 1 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}) = 1 \)

Since the descriptions are uniformly sampled:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
