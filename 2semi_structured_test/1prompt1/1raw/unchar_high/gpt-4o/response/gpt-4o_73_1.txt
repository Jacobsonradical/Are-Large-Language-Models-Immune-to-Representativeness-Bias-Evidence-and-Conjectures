To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the key portions of the Bayes' formula we'll use:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason having the described traits.

First, let's define our probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Since the description given of Jason does not provide any specific traits that uniquely distinguish computer science or humanities professors, we assume \( P(B|A) \) is the same for both groups (that is, the probability of having these traits given the professor is in either group is roughly equal).

Therefore:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \)

We apply Bayes' theorem (assuming equal distribution of description traits among both groups):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), \( P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \).

Given that the distributions of traits are assumed to be the same:
\[ P(B) â‰ˆ P(B|A) \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
