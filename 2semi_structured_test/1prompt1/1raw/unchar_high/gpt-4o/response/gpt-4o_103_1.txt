To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) given new evidence (Jason's description).

Let's define the following:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(A|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Without specific likelihoods \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \), we often assume the description is equally typical for both groups due to lack of distinctive information. This simplifies calculation, but this uniform assumption must be acknowledged as a limitation.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) P(A)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) is a weighted average of the conditional probabilities:

\[
P(D) = P(D|A) P(A) + P(D|B) P(B)
\]

If we assume \( P(D|A) \approx P(D|B) \) then:

\[
P(D|A) \approx P(D|B)
\]

Thus, 

\[
P(A|D) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
\]

Rewriting we get:

\[
P(A|D) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the approximate probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[
\{ "probability": "0.75" \}
\]
