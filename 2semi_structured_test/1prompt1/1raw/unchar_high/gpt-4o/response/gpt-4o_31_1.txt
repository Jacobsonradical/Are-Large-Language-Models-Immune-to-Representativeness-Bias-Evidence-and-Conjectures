To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since the description doesn't seem to differentiate between the fields clearly, we assume the description is equally likely for professors in both fields (\( P(B|A) \) is the same for computer science and humanities).

First, we compute \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \):

- The number of computer science professors \( n_{CS} = 75 \)
- The number of humanities professors \( n_H = 25 \)
- Total number of professors \( n_{Total} = 100 \)

So,
\[ P(A) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{Total}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_H) = \frac{n_H}{n_{Total}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that the description is not biased towards either field, \( P(B|A) = P(B|A_H) \). Hence, the likelihoods cancel out:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A_H) \cdot P(A_H) \]
Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A_H) \), it simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(A_H)) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 \]

And thus, 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A_H)} = P(A) \]

Therefore, given that the description is random and does not provide specific distinguishing information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample simplifies to the prior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
