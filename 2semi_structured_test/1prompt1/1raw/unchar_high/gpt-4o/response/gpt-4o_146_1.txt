To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to consider the base rates of the two groups and the fact that the description is given randomly among the two groups.

The base rates are:
- 75 computer science professors
- 25 humanities professors

Total number of professors in the sample is 100.

Given no specific information that would differentiate between the two groups based on the description alone, we use the base rates to compute the probability.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) can be computed as follows:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} \]

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} \]

\[ P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
