To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- The total sample size includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
- A description of a single professor (Jason) has been chosen randomly.

We are to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given that his description was chosen.

Let:
- \( C \) represent Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description provided for Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:

- \( P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to assume that the probability of getting the description \( D \) should be the same (common personality traits) for both groups since no additional distinguishing detail about fields was provided in the description other than the positive traits. Hence, \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) can be considered equally likely. This results in:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Given that \( P(D|C) \approx 1 \) and \( P(D|H) \approx 1 \), we only need the prior probabilities to determine the result:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) \) can be considered a normalization factor and \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), we replace:

\[ P(C|D) = P(C) \]

So,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
