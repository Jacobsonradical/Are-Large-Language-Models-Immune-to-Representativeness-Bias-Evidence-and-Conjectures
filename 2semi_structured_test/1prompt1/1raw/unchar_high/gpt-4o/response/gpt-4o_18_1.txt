To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. In this case, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define the following events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we need the prior probabilities of Jason being from each group:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science \(P(C)\):
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities \(P(H)\):
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We want \(P(C|D)\), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

To simplify, let's assume the descriptions are equally likely whether Jason is from computer science or humanities, so \(P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1\). This assumption implies no bias in the descriptions for either group.

The denominator \(P(D)\) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substitute the assumptions:
\[
P(D) = (1) \cdot 0.75 + (1) \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
\]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
