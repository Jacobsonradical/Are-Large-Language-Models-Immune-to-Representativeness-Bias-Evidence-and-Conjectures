To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Description provided fits Jason.

We're trying to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: 
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Complementary Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: 
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - The description does not provide specific details that would influence a particular likelihood for \( P(B|A) \) (computer science) or \( P(B|\neg A) \) (humanities) based on the information provided. So, unless we have evidence that the description is more likely to be for one group or the other, we'll assume it is equally probable for both.
   \[
   P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A)
   \]

Since the description is chosen at random and assumed equally likely for either group, the likelihood \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \) cancels out in the Bayes' Theorem equation. Thus, it simplifies to the prior probability:

\[ P(A|B) \approx P(A) \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
P(A|B) = 0.75
\]

So, the final answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
