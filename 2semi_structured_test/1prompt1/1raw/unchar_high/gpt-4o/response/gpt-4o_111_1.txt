To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

We are given the following information:
1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. A professor (Jason) is randomly chosen and we need to determine the probability that he is one of the computer science professors given his description.

First, define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of the professor being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the professor being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description is equally likely to apply to any professor regardless of their field (i.e., \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)), the term \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), let's denote this common value as \( k \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k (P(C) + P(H)) = k (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

So:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

The answer in the requested format is:
