To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of professors interviewed is 100.
2. There are 75 computer science professors.
3. There are 25 humanities professors.

We need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

First, let's determine \( P(CS) \):

\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we determine \( P(H) \) for the humanities professors:

\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

We know that the prior probabilities are set by the sample sizes; however, since specific probabilities for the given description are not provided (e.g., the likelihood that a computer science professor has Jason's traits vs. a humanities professor having those traits), we assume that the given description is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors.

Let’s assign the likelihoods based on this assumption:

\[
P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1 
\]

Calculate the total probability \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = (P(D | CS) \times P(CS)) + (P(D | H) \times P(H)) = (1 \times 0.75) + (1 \times 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
\]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( 0.75 \).

So the answer is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
