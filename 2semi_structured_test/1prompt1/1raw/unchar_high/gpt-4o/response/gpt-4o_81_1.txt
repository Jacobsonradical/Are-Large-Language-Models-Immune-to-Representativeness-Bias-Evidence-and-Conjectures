To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Bayesâ€™ Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (Jason is a computer science professor) is true given the evidence (the description of Jason).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the hypothesis is true (before observing the evidence).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.

In this case:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: The description provided.

We can start by calculating the prior probabilities.
- \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science department is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(A^c) \) (The complement of A): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities department is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Without any specific details about how likely such a description is from the two groups, we assume these are equally likely for both groups since no distinguishing information was provided. Thus:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), and these probabilities cancel each other out in the calculation, acting as equal constants.

Thus, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]
Since \( P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 \),

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{1} = P(A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 (or 75%).

Here is the answer in the specified format:
{"probability": "0.75"}
