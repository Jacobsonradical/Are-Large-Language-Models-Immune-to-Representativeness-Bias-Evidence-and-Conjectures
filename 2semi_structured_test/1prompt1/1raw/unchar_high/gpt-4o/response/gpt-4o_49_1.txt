To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's define the probabilities we need:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the given description, Jason, given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the given description, Jason, given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the given description, Jason.

From the information given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- And \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given that we do not have additional information about the different likelihoods of descriptions for computer science vs. humanities professors, we assume that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the normalizing constant:

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Since we assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), let's call it \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = P(D) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H))
\]

Since \( P(CS) + P(H) = 1 \):

\[
P(D) = P(D) \cdot 1 = P(D)
\]

So:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} = 0.75
\]

Given these assumptions and simplifications, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
