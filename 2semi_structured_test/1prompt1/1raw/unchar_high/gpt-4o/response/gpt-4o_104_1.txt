To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, without specific probabilities \( P(D | CS) \) and \(P(D | H) \), we assume that the description \( D \) applies equally to professors in computer science and humanities. So, \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \).

Thus, \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), letâ€™s denote it by the common term \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D) \cdot 0.75 + P(D) \cdot 0.25 = P(D)(0.75 + 0.25) = P(D) \]

Given this, we simplify Bayes' theorem in this particular case:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D) \cdot 0.75}{P(D)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
\[ \boxed{0.75} \]

So the answer is: {"probability": "0.75"}
