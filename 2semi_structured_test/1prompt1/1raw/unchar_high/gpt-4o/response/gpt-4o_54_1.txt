To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. This involves understanding the base rates of the two groups and then updating our beliefs with the given description.

First, recognize the proportion of professors in each field:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the total number of professors is \(75 + 25 = 100\).

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We are given the description of Jason but no specific characteristic that strongly distinguishes between CS and humanities professors in the given context. Hence, we consider the prior probabilities as they stand because the description provided (Jason is high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and has a positive reputation) is equally likely in both fields given the information we have.

Using Bayes' theorem, where the evidence given doesn't differentially affect the likelihoods, the posterior probability remains aligned with the prior. Therefore:

\[
P(\text{CS Prof} \mid \text{Jason's description}) = P(\text{CS Prof}) = 0.75
\]

So the answer is:
\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
