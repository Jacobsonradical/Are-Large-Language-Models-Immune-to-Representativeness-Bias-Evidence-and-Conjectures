To address the problem using Bayes' Theorem, we need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Jason's description.

We are interested in finding \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Given the number of professors in each category:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 75 + 25 = 100.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Without additional information, we assume the probability of the description \(D\) given Jason's field is equal for both categories, implying:
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

Normally, this would mean the description doesn't provide additional discriminative power between the two fields.

For our calculations, we simplify by assuming \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\) as long as the description doesn't favor one group over the other. This simplifies our formula:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \cdot P(D|H) \]

Since \(P(D|C) \approx P(D|H)\), they cancel out:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
