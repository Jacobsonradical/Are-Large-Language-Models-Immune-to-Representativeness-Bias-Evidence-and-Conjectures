To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Given a description that is equally likely to apply to professors in both computer science and the humanities, we can start by calculating the base rate of the professors in each field.

First, we know that there are:
- 75 computer science professors (CS)
- 25 humanities professors (H)

So, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description provided does not favor either group and is equally likely for both groups, the likelihood \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) are equal.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) * P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be considered as a normalizing constant that makes the probabilities sum to 1, and the description is equally likely given either group, we can simplify it to:

\[
P(\text{Description}) =  P(\text{Description} | CS) * P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) * P(H)
\]

But, because \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), the equation simplifies further and we focus only on the prior probabilities:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
\]

Thus:

\[
P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

```
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
