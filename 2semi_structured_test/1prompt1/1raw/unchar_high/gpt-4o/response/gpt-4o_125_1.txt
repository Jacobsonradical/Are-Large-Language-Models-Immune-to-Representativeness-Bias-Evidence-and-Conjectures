To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We'll start by defining our terms:

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
Let \( B \) be the event of the given description of Jason.

We are seeking \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we'll compute the prior probability \( P(A) \):

There are 75 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors, so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(A^c) \)), where \( A^c \) denotes the complement of event \( A \), is:

There are 25 humanities professors out of the total 100 professors, so:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we assume the likelihood of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(B|A) \) is the same as the likelihood of the description \( B \) given that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(B|A^c) \).

Because the description provided does not favor any specific field, we'll assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \).

Under the assumption that:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

We can use these equalities to simplify our problem since \(P(B)\) can be expressed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A^c) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), they will cancel out, simplifying our calculation to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(A^c)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75 \cdot P(B|A)}{0.75 \cdot P(B|A) + 0.25 \cdot P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
