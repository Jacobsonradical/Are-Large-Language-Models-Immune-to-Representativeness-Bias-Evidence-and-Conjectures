To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | Hum) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we have no reason to believe Jason's description is more likely in one field over the other, we assume that \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \).

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25 \)

We want to compute \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Since we assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | Hum) \), it simplifies:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | Hum) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \]

Therefore, \( P(CS | D) \) simplifies to:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.75}{P(D | CS)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
