To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors, and there are 100 professors in total.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Determine the likelihood:**
   - The problem does not provide specific likelihoods \( P(desc|CS) \) and \( P(desc|H) \) based on the description. In the absence of explicit differences, we'll assume the likelihood of having such a description is equally likely for a computer science professor and a humanities professor.

3. **Compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(desc)}
   \]

   Since \( P(desc|CS) \) and \( P(desc|H) \) are assumed to be equal, the denominator \( P(desc) \) simplifies. The term \( P(desc) \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(desc) = P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(desc|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Given equal likelihoods, \[
   P(desc|CS) = P(desc|H) = k
   \]
   thus,
   \[
   P(desc) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) = k \cdot 1 = k
   \]

   Plug this back into the posterior probability formula:
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{k \cdot P(CS)}{k} = P(CS)
   \]

4. **Simplified calculation:**
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = P(CS) = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
