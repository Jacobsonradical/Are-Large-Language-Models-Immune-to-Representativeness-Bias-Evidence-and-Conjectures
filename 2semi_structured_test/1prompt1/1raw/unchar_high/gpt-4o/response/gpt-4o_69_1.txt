To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Let's define the events:
   - \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \(J\): The description provided is that of Jason.

2. We need to find P(C|J), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

3. Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)}
   \]

4. We need to find:
   - \(P(C)\), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(H)\), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   - \(P(J|C)\), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(J|H)\), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
   - \(P(J)\), the total probability of Jason's description.

5. From the study:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

6. Assuming the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor as a humanities professor (as no specific information differentiates the likelihood):
   - \(P(J|C) = P(J|H) = 1\)

7. Using the law of total probability, \(P(J)\) is:
   \[
   P(J) = P(J|C) \cdot P(C) + P(J|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(J) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
   \]

8. Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
