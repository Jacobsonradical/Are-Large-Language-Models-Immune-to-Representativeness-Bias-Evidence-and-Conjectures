To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the given description matches Jason.

In this problem:
- We have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. 
- The total number of professors is 100.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A_{Hum}) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description "Jason is a 30-year-old man, married and without children. He is known for his high ability and strong motivation. Well-liked by his colleagues, Jason enjoys a positive reputation in his professional environment." does not point to any specific information that allows us to differentiate between the two groups definitively, and it's given that other personality descriptions will also be broadly similar in terms of personal and professional success traits:

- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): Probability that a computer science professor fits the description.
- \( P(B|A_{Hum}) \): Probability that a humanities professor fits the description.

Assuming the descriptions also do not strongly favor one group over the other populace-wise, they would be estimated as similar:

- \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_{Hum}) \approx 1 \)

Thus, by Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

Given that \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx  P(B|A_{Hum}) \), and recognizing the total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{Hum}) P(A_{Hum}) \approx P(B|A_{CS}) \times 0.75 + P(B|A_{Hum}) \times 0.25 \]
\[ = 1 \times 0.75 + 1 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) \approx \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.75"}
