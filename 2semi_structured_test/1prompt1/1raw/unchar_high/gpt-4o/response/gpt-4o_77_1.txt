To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem defines the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A (Jason is in computer science) given event B (the given description of Jason).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B (the given description) given event A (Jason is in computer science).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A (Jason is in computer science).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event B (the given description).

Given the data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A_{CS}) \) = Probability Jason is a computer science professor = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- \( P(A_H) \) = Probability Jason is a humanities professor = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Without specific differentiating factors in Jason’s description that indicate a higher likelihood of being in one field over the other, we can assume the description doesn’t change the likelihood:

Thus, \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_H) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(A_{CS}|B) \):

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B|A_{CS}) \approx P(B|A_H) \),

\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_H) \cdot P(A_H) \]

Since \( P(B|A_{CS}) ≈ P(B|A_H) \), they cancel out, and thus,

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Answer:

\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
