To answer the question, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The given conditions are:

- 75 professors out of 100 are from computer science.
- 25 professors out of 100 are from the humanities.

We are selecting descriptions at random. Thus, the base rates for the two groups are:

- Probability of selecting a computer science professor, P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor, P(Hum) = 25/100 = 0.25

Given the description of Jason, we have no additional information suggesting distinct personality traits that differentiate a computer science professor from a humanities professor explicitly in this context. So, we rely on the base rates for our probability calculation.

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(CS|Description)\)) given the random description provided.

Since the description does not inherently favor either group and assuming equal likelihood of such descriptions being applicable to both groups, our updated probability relies mainly on the base rate probabilities.

Thus, 

- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, remains the base rate, P(CS) = 0.75.

So, the result is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
