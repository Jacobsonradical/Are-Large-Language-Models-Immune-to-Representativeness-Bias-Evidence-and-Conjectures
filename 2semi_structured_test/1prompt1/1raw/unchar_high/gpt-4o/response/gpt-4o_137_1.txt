To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. Number of computer science professors (\(C\)): 75
2. Number of humanities professors (\(H\)): 25
3. Total number of professors (\(T\)): 100

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)} \]

where:
- \(P(C|J)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (Jason).
- \(P(J|C)\) is the probability of Jason having that description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of a professor being from computer science.
- \(P(J)\) is the overall probability of getting the description of Jason.

Given the random description nature and nothing specific about Jason leaning more towards one field over another, the description Jason is independent of the field of study. Thus, we can consider:

- \(P(J|C) = P(J|H)\), because the description should be typical for both fields based on the formulation.
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Bayes' theorem simplifies since \(P(J)\) is a normalization factor which ensures probabilities sum to 1, and thus we can ignore it in this relative probability calculation:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Since we know:

\[ P(C) = 0.75 \quad \text{and} \quad P(H) = 0.25 \]

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
