To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem and the principle of conditional probability. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (C: 75).
- There are 25 humanities professors (H: 25).

We need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided. This can be written as \( P(C | \text{Description}) \).

Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

To simplify, we can note:
- \( P(C) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To proceed, we need to consider that the description provided doesn't specify any features that favor either C or H, thus we assume \( P(\text{Description} | C) = P(\text{Description} | H) \).

Given this, we have:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} | C) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), they cancel out from the numerator and denominator:

\[ P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
