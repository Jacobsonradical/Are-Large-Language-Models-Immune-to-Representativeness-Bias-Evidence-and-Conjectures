To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be written as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the information provided:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The description does not seem to contain specific information that discriminates between computer science and humanities professors (i.e., it does not favor one group over the other).

We assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Let's calculate the priors:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since \( D \) is equally likely for both groups:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \)

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), they cancel out:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Answer in the specified format:
\[ \{"probability": "0.75"\} \]
