To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The information provided gives us the initial (prior) probabilities and the group sizes:

- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Given this, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(H)) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We also have the description of Jason, but it does not provide any additional information that differentiates between a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Under the assumption that the description provides no additional distinguishing information (Jason being equally likely from computer science or humanities given the traits described), the likelihood of observing such a description is the same for both fields. Thus:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), and the total probability can be given by the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that these are equal likelihoods:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 = P(D|CS) \]

Thus, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{1} = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Since the description does not provide additional differential information about the field of study, we conclude that the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
