To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the proportions of professors in each category and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:

- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor

We know:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The prior probabilities (based on proportion) are:

\[
P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Since we are given no additional distinguishing information about Jason that would make being one discipline more likely than the other beyond the initial distribution, we assume the descriptions are equally likely for any professor in either group. 

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:

\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = P(C) = 0.75
\]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.75"}}
\]
