To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, let's use Bayesian reasoning. 

First, we have to identify our prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors out of the total sample of 100.
- There are 25 humanities professors out of the total sample of 100.

This means the prior probability (P(CS)) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The prior probability (P(H)) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

The description provided does not statistically favor either group specifically in terms of unique characteristics (as nothing specific to either field was mentioned and both groups are composed of successful and well-reputed individuals).

Thus, the likelihoods (P(Description|CS) and P(Description|H)) might reasonably be assumed equal because the description could equally apply to both groups. So:

\( P(Description|CS) = P(Description|H) \)

In Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS|Description) \) is then proportional to the product of the prior probability \( P(CS) \) and the likelihood \( P(Description|CS) \).

Hence, the posterior probability \( P(CS|Description) \) is:

\( P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|H) \times P(H)} \)

Given \( P(Description|CS) \approx P(Description|H) \):

\( P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = 0.75 \)

So, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
