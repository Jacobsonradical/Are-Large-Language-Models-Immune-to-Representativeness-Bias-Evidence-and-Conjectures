To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are asked to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, if we assume that the description is just as likely for a computer science professor as it is for a humanities professor (i.e., \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \)), these probabilities will cancel each other out in Bayes' formula. Thus,
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) = P(D \mid C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D \mid H) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D \mid C) \]

Therefore, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D \mid C)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
