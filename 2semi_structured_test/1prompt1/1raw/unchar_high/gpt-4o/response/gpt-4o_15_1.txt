To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem and consider the given information.

Firstly, let's summarize the given data:
- Total professors: 100
  - Computer science professors: 75
  - Humanities professors: 25

The probability we are looking for is the posterior probability that Jason is from the computer science department given his description. Let's define the events as follows:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor

We are interested in \(P(C | \text{description})\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}\]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that a professor is from humanities, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Assuming the personality description does not favor one discipline over the other, the likelihoods \(P(\text{description} | C)\) and \(P(\text{description} | H)\) are considered to be the same. Therefore, the probability \(P(\text{description})\) can be calculated as follows:
\[P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)\]

Given that the description is equally likely for both disciplines, these simplify to:
\[P(\text{description}) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k (0.75 + 0.25) = k\]

Since \(k\) does not change between events, it cancels out in the Bayes' theorem calculation:
\[P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\{"probability": "0.75"\}
