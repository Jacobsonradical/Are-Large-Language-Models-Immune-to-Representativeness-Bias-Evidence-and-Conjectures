Let's tackle the problem with the information provided and apply basic principles of probability.

First, note the number of professors in each group:
- Computer Science (CS) professors: 75
- Humanities (H) professors: 25
- Total professors: 100

Next, you have a random description of one of these 100 professors. We need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given no additional information in the description that strongly discriminates between the groups.

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For our purposes:
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability of selecting a CS professor.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of selecting a Humanities professor.
- \(P(description|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description being for a CS professor.
- \(P(description|H)\) is the likelihood of the description being for a Humanities professor.

Here, we note that the description does not preferentially describe one group over the other, implying \(P(description|CS) = P(description|H)\). Thus, these terms effectively cancel out in Bayes' formula, simplifying the calculation to just the prior probabilities.

The prior probability of a professor being from CS:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The prior probability of a professor being from Humanities:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description is primarily determined by these prior probabilities. We can express this as:
\[ P(CS|description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
