To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor

From the study:
- Total number of professors = 100
    - Computer science professors = 75
    - Humanities professors = 25

We need:
\[ P(CS \mid D) \]
Where:
- \( D \) = Description of Jason

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Assuming that the description \( D \) is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors (i.e., there is no bias indicated in the provided description for any particular group), then:
\[ P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \]

Given that:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The unconditional probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are assumed to be equal, we can simplify the probability calculation because the description applies equally to both groups. Therefore:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{\{"probability": "0.75"\}} \]
