To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C \mid \text{Jason}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.

From the numbers given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- So, the total number of professors is \( 75 + 25 = 100 \).

Thus:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we assume that given the random selection and the description of Jason, the probability of being chosen for either field does not depend on the description because the description does not give specific information related to the field. That is:
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \) is equivalent to \( P(\text{Jason} \mid H) \).

Given that we do not have information that favors one group over the other from the description, we assume:
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid C) = P(\text{Jason} \mid H) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Jason})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Jason}) = P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Jason} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given our assumption \( P(\text{Jason} \mid C) = P(\text{Jason} \mid H) \):
\[ P(\text{Jason}) = P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \cdot P(H) = P(\text{Jason} \mid C) (P(C) + P(H)) = P(\text{Jason} \mid C) \]

Thus:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
