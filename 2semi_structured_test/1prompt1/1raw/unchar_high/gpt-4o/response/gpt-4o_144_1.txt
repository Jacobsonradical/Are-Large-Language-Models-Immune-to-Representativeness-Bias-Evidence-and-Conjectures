To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Total Professors**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the total number of professors is 75 + 25 = 100.

2. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor before any description is given (prior probability):
     \[
     P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor before any description is given:
     \[
     P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

3. **Likelihood**:
   - Since no specific probabilities are provided about how likely the description matches professors from computer science versus humanities, we'll assume that any professor in the sample is equally likely to have the description.
   - Thus, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \), can be assumed to be 1 (assuming itâ€™s equally (or randomly) chosen among computer science professors).
   - Similarly, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \), can also be assumed to be 1.

4. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We need to find \( P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Here, \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the total probability of the description, which can be found via:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   P(\text{Computer Science}|\text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
