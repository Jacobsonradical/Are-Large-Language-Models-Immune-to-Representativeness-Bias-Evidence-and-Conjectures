To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we proceed:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that Jason is the person described.

2. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \) = Probability that any random drawn professor is from computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(A^c) \) = Probability that any random drawn professor is from humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Assume Equal Likelihood for Description:**
   - Since we have no other information distinguishing Jason between the two groups, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups, thus the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) (probability of being Jason given he is a computer science professor) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (probability of being Jason given he is a humanities professor) are each \( \frac{1}{75} \) and \( \frac{1}{25} \) respectively.

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \), the total probability of the event \( B \), can be found using:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{1}{75} \]
\[ P(B|A^c) = \frac{1}{25} \]
\[ P(A) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A^c) = 0.25 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{75} \cdot 0.75\right) + \left(\frac{1}{25} \cdot 0.25\right) \]
\[ P(B) = \left(\frac{0.75}{75}\right) + \left(\frac{0.25}{25}\right) \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25 \cdot 3}{75} = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.75}{75} = \frac{1.5}{75} = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02\]

Finally, plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{75}\right) \cdot 0.75}{0.02} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{75 \cdot 0.02} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.5 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.5"}} \]
