To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of the description.

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors (\(n_{CS}\)) = 75
- The number of humanities professors (\(n_{H}\)) = 25

The prior probability \(P(A)\) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{CS} + n_{H}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability \(P(C_{H})\) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(C_{H}) = \frac{n_{H}}{n_{CS} + n_{H}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor as it is to describe a humanities professor, we have:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|C_{H}) \]

Thus:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|C_{H}) \cdot P(C_{H}) \]

Given \(P(B|A) = P(B|C_{H})\), this simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(C_{H})) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(B|A)} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
