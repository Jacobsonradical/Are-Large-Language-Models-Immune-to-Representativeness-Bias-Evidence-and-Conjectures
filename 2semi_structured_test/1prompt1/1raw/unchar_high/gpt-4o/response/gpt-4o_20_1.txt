In order to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description being observed in the sample.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

This gives us:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since the description is chosen at random and there is no additional specific information distinguishing computer science professors from humanities professors based on the description given, we assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal. Consequently, the specific description is equally likely to be given for professors in either field.

Given this, \( P(B) \) is the weighted average of the probabilities:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are assumed to be equal, 
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \approx P(B) \]

Therefore, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75. The answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
