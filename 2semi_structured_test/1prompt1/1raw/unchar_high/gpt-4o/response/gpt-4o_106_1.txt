To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can compute it:

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The given description matches a professor in the study.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probability, \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors and 100 total professors, so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, the probability of the description \( B \) occurring in general, \( P(B) \), is not directly available but can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the symmetry of the problem and not having additional information that differentiates the two groups in terms of their descriptions matching, we can assume that the description mechanism doesn't favor one group over the other, implying:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Since this value is the same and cancels out in our calculation, we can simplify to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) = P(B|A) \cdot [P(A) + P(\neg A)] = P(B|A) \cdot 1 \]

So, ultimately, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the result is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
