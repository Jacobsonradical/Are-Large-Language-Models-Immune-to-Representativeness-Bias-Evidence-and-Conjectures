To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's identify and define the relevant events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason fits the given description.

We want to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given the setup of the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors: 100.

So the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, let:
- \( A^c \): Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, since we don't have enough information to distinguish the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) from \( P(B|A^c) \) based on the description alone, we assume that the description is equally probable whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Thus:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \implies P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

Let's denote this common likelihood as \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = k \). Substituting into the formula:
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
