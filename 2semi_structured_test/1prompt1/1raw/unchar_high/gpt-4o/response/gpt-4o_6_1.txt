To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, and it helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that we have Jason's description.

We'll use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

From the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors in the sample (\( n_{CS} = 75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample (\( n_{H} = 25 \)).
- Total number of professors: \( n_{total} = 100 \).

We need to find the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, is assumed to be 1 (since we have no information suggesting Jason's description is more or less likely for any group).

For the total probability \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Where:
- \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, is also assumed to be 1 (similar reasoning).

So, \( P(B) \) is calculated as follows:
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore:
