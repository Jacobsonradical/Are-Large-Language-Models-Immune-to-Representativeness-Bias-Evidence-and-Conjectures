To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probabilities based on new evidence.

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) be the event that we have the given description of Jason.

From the problem statement, we know:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's break this down:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(B) \): The probability of the description

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Probability of the description given Jason is from computer science \( P(B|A) \)**:
   We do not have specific values for \( P(B|A) \) or \( P(B|\neg A) \); however, since the sample description seems equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

3. **Total probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The total probability of the description \( P(B) \) is a weighted sum of the probabilities from each group:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since we are assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \) is equal, simplify without these exact values:

Let's say:
- \( P(B|A) = k \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = k \)

Then:

\[ P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) = k ( P(A) + P(\neg A) ) \]
\[ P(B) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Thus:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
