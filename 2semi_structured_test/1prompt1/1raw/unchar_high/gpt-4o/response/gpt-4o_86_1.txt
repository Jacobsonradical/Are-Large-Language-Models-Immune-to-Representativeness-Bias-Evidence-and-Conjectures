To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is from the computer science group.
- \( B \) be the given description of Jason.

We want to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We are given:
- The total number of computer science professors \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The total number of humanities professors \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description, we can use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

We assume \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \) since no specific distinguishing information is provided about the description's being more likely in one group or the other. Thus,

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|\neg A) \cdot 0.25 \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \), let \( P(B|A) = x \) and \( P(B|\neg A) = x \):
\[ P(B) = x \cdot 0.75 + x \cdot 0.25 = x(0.75 + 0.25) = x \cdot 1 = x \]

So \( P(B) = x \).

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
