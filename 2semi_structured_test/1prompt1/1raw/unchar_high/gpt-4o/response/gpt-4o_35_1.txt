To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the events**:
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Total probabilities**:
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(A) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(B) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Given the description, we assume it's equally likely to describe professors from both groups given they are successful and meet such criteria of high ability, strong motivation, and being well-liked**.

4. **Calculate the total probability of the description (denoted \( D \))**:
   - Assume \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) = 1 \) given the problem statement doesn't favor one group over the other for fitting the description.

5. **Apply Bayes' theorem** to find \( P(A|D) \):
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
   \]

6. **Since \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability**:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 1
   \]

7. **Thus, we find \( P(A|D) \)**:
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
