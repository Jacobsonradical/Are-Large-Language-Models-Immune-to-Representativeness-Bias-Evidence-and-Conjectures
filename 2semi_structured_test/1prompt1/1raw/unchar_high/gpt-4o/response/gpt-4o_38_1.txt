Let’s use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

First, we need to define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in humanities. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We are also given a description of Jason, but since the description does not specify any traits that are explicitly more likely for one group over the other, we will assume that the description applies to both groups equally. Therefore, the likelihood of this description, given Jason’s discipline, does not change the posterior probability. This means \( P(\text{Description} \mid A) = P(\text{Description} \mid B) \).

We use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid A) = P(\text{Description} \mid B) \), they cancel out in the ratio, simplifying to:

\[
P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
\]

Hence:

\[
P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
