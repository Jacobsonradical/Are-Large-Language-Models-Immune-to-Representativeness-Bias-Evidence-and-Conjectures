To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Determine Base Rates:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The description itself does not specifically suggest traits that strongly favor one discipline over the other, so we might assume the likelihood of such a description for both disciplines is similar, i.e., \( P(Descrip|CS) \approx P(Descrip|H) \). Let's assume these probabilities are equal for simplicity, say \( x \).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   - \( P(CS|Descrip) = \frac{P(Descrip|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Descrip)} \).

Since \( P(Descrip) = P(Descrip|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Descrip|H) \times P(H) \) and assuming \( P(Descrip|CS) \approx P(Descrip|H) \):

\( P(Descrip) = x * 0.75 + x * 0.25 = x (0.75 + 0.25) = x \).

So,

\( P(CS|Descrip) = \frac{x * 0.75}{x} = 0.75 \).

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the answer in the required format:
