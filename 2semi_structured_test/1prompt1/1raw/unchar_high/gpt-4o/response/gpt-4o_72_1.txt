To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \(C_s\): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_s\): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): the description given for Jason.

We want to compute \(P(C_s | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(D)} \]

We know:
- \(P(C_s) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H_s) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

To find \(P(D)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s) + P(D | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]

Assuming that the description \(D\) ("high ability and strong motivation," "well-liked by colleagues," and "positive reputation") can be considered equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors, we can assume \(P(D | C_s) = P(D | H_s)\).

Given that:
\[ P(D | C_s) = P(D | H_s) \]

Since \(P(D | C_s)\) and \(P(D | H_s)\) should both be equal (due to the equal likelihood assumption), we can simplify \(P(D)\) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s) + P(D | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | C_s) \cdot 0.75 + P(D | H_s) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

So we can consider:
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
