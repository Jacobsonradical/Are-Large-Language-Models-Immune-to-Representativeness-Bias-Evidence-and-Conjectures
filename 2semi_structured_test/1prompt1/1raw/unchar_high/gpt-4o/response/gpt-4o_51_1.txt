To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, we define the events:
- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \) : The description fits Jason

We are given:
- Number of computer science professors (\( n_C \)) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (\( n_H \)) = 25
- Total number of professors = 100

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{75}{100} \) = 0.75
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{25}{100} \) = 0.25

Assuming that the description \( D \) does not favor either field specifically and is equally likely for both groups of professors, then \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can simplify \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|C) \cdot 1 = P(D|C) \]
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Here is the formatted answer:
{"probability": "0.75"}
