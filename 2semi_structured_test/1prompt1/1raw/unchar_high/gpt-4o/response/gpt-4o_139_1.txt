To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:

- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities (H) professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.
- \( P(H | D) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description.

From the problem statement, we know:

- There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Assuming the description is equally likely to apply to both CS and humanities professors, we have:

- \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior probability as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \) and \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), it simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the prior probabilities:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
