To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here, we are given that:

- \( N_{CS} = 75 \) (Number of computer science professors)
- \( N_{H} = 25 \) (Number of humanities professors)
- \( N_{Total} = 100 \) (Total number of professors)

The base rate probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate probability that a professor is from humanities is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming that the description given (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues, etc.) is equally likely to describe a professor from either field, we have:
\[ P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H) \]

Given that these probabilities are the same, by Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Since \( P(Description) \) is the same for both fields and cancels out, we have:
\[ P(CS | Description) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
