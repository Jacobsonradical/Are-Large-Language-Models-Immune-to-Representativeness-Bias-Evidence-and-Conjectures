To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

First, let's define our events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(J\): Jason's description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues).

We are interested in \(P(C|J)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(J|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(J)} \]

where:
- \(P(J|C)\) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(J)\) is the probability of Jason's description.

Given that the selection is at random, we initially assume that Jason has an equal chance of being any one of the 100 professors.

Given the numbers:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Since no specific information in Jason's description provides a differential likelihood of him being in one group compared to the other, we assume \(P(J|C) = P(J|H)\). This suggests the description is equally likely for both groups:

\[ P(J) = P(J|C) \cdot P(C) + P(J|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \(P(J|C) = P(J|H)\), we can call this common value \(P(J|A)\):

\[ P(J) = P(J|A) \cdot P(C) + P(J|A) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(J) = P(J|A) (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(J) = P(J|A) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(J) = P(J|A) \]

With these considerations, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to the ratio of the priors:

\[ P(C|J) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Since \(P(C) + P(H) = 1\):

\[ P(C|J) = P(C) \]

Therefore:

\[ P(C|J) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
