To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we are tasked specifically to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
   
   Without additional information directly quantifying these likelihoods, we typically assume that the descriptions are equally likely across both groups unless stated otherwise. Therefore, we can suppose: \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \).

3. **Unconditional probability of the description:**
   - We need to find \( P(\text{Description}) \), which can be computed through the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
     \]

Given the assumption \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \), this term will cancel out in Bayes' theorem, simplifying our calculation to:

4. **Applying Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

By substitution, as \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) cancel out from numerator and denominator:

\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
