To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to consider the prior probabilities and any evidence provided by the description. However, in this scenario, the description provided does not differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, so we rely on the prior probabilities.

1. The total number of professors in the sample is 100.
2. There are 75 computer science professors.
3. There are 25 humanities professors.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is therefore:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that we do not have any differentiating information from the description, the updated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors remains the same as the prior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = P(CS) \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.75 \]

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
