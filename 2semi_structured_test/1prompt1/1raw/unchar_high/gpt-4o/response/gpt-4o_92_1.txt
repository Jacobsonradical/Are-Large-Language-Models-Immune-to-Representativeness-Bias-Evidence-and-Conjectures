To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed mathematically as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (this is what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring.

First, let's lay out the given information:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor: 
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. The prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we assume that there is no difference in the probabilities of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor based on the given description (i.e., \( P(B|A) \) is equal to \( P(B|\neg A) \)), we have:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, \( P(B) \) can be broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let's denote this common probability by \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

The formula for \( P(A|B) \) becomes:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = P(A) \]

So, we now have:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75 (or 75%).

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
