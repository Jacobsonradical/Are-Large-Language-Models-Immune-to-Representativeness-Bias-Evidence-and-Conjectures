To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

We start with the following information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Let's denote the description provided as \( D \). We need \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We also need:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Given that no specific information strongly differentiates computer science professors from humanities professors within the description and assuming only the relevant priors apply (e.g., personalities of high ability, strong motivation, and good collegial relationships are common among successful academics regardless of their field). We can assume \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) \).

Let's denote this common probability as \( P(D|A) \):
- \( P(D|CS) \approx P(D|Hum) = P(D|A) \).

The equation for total probability \( P(D) \) simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot (P(CS) + P(Hum)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \]

Thus, Bayes' Theorem reduces to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|A)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|A)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Answer: {"probability": "0.75"}
