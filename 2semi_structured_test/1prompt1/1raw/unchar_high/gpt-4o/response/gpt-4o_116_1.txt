To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that he is a successful academic with the provided description, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let's define the events:
- \( CS \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) : Description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \).

1. Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(CS) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(H) \):
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

To continue, we need the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). However, if we assume that the given description is equally likely for computer science and humanities professors because the description doesn't carry specific information biased towards either field, we get:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

So,
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) \]

But for simplicity since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \) and they cancel out:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
