To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(H) \)

   Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Compute Likelihood:**
   - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \)
   - Likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \)

   Since the description does not provide explicit statistical measures, we assume that the general characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation) are equally probable in both fields. Thus:
   \[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We need to find \( P(CS|D) \):

   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

   And for completeness, \( P(H|D) \) would be:
   \[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} \]

   Given that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = k \):
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{k \times 0.75}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(H|D) = \frac{k \times 0.25}{P(D)} \]

   Since the sum of probabilities must equal 1:
   \[ \frac{k \times 0.75}{P(D)} + \frac{k \times 0.25}{P(D)} = 1 \]
   \[ k \times (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D) \]
   \[ k = P(D) \]

4. **Finalize Probability:**
   Since \( k = P(D) \):
   \[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75k}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
