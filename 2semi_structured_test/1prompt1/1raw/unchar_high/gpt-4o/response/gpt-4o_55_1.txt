To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s the detailed computation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability (P) that Jason is a computer science professor:
     \(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
     \(P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Assuming no additional information from the description (i.e., the description given is equally likely for a computer science professor and a humanities professor), the likelihood can be considered equal.
     - \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities})\)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   Since the likelihoods are equal, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is proportional to the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is simply the prior probability:
