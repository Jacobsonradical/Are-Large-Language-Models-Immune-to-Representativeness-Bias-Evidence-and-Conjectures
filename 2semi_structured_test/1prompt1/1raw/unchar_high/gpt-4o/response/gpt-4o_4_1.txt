To answer this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the conditional probability.

Let's define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C \mid D) \), the conditional probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor \( P(C) \) is:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- The probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that the description \( D \) does not significantly differ between the two groups (as no specific distinguishing features between computer science and humanities were provided in the description), we can assume:
\[ P(D \mid C) \approx P(D \mid H) \]

Since the description \( D \) is chosen randomly and there are no distinguishing factors to favor one group over the other, we treat the likelihood of this description being equally probable for professors in both fields. Thus, we simplify:
\[ P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \]
\[ P(D) \]

Now calculating the posterior probability:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
