To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to determine the probabilities involved:

1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. \( P(D \mid C) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Since personal characteristics such as marital status, children, reputation, and motivation are not specified as differing between fields, we assume that:
   \[ P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \]

4. \( P(D) \): The total probability of Jason's description. This is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we assume \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), we call this \( P(D \mid * ) \).

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid * ) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid * ) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid * ) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid * ) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid * ) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid * ) \]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), they cancel out in the Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid * ) \cdot 0.75}{P(D \mid * )} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
