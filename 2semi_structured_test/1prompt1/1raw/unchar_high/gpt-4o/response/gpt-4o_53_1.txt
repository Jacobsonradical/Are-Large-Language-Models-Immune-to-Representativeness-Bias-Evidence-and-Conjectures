To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events.

Let:
- \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) denote the description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the symmetry of the descriptions and the lack of specific distinguishing characteristics that would favor either group more, we can assume \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \). Therefore, \( P(D) \) simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's summarize the known data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Then, assuming \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal, the equation simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
