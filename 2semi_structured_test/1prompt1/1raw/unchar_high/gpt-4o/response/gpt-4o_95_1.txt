To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here we are concerned with computing \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). 

Bayes’ theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this problem:

- \( A \) is that Jason is a computer science professor (CS).
- \( B \) is the description \( D \).

1. **Prior Probability of being a Computer Science Professor (\( P(CS) \)):**
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Prior Probability of being a Humanities Professor (\( P(H) \)):**
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **Probability of Description given being a Computer Science Professor (\( P(D|CS) \)) and given being a Humanities Professor (\( P(D|H) \))**: Since the description is chosen randomly from the 100 available descriptions and doesn’t favor one field over the other, we assume that:
   \[
   P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \approx 1 \text{ (both descriptions are equally likely to match the given traits)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability of the Description (\( P(D) \)):**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

Given both are approximately 1:

\[
P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
\]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{
  "probability": "0.75"
}
