To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem and given information.

Let's denote:
- \( C = \) Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H = \) Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Jason is one of the 100 professors (either in computer science or humanities).

We need to find the probability \( P(C|E) \), where \( E \) is the description given.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute or estimate:
- \( P(C) \) - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|C) \) - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) - The total probability of the description.

Prior probabilities:

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Likelihoods and total probability:

Assuming nothing in the description particularly favors one group over the other (i.e., no specific traits that are particularly common in either group based on the description):

\[ P(E|C) = P(E|H) \]

So, we assume:

\[ P(E|C) = P(E|H) \approx 1 \]

The total probability of the description \( P(E) \) is the weighted sum of the likelihoods:

\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(E) \approx (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(C|E) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
