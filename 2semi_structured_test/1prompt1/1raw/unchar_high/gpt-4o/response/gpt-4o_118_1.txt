To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in its general form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: The description matches Jason.

First, let's determine \(P(A)\) and \(P(A^c)\):
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The number of humanities professors is 25.
- Therefore, \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- And, \(P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Without additional specific information regarding \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A^c)\) (i.e., the likelihood of the description given the field), we often assume they are the same because the description does not appear to favor one specific field.

Therefore, we compute \(P(B)\) based on the total population:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Given that:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

We can see that:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

Since \(P(B|A)\) cancels out in Bayes' formula, the probability ends up being just the prior probability \(P(A)\):

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
