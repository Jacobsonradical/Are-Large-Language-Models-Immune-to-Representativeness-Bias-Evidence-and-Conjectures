To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how to do it step-by-step:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( C \): Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
   - \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): Description of Jason provided.

2. **Given Data:**
   - \( P(C) \): The prior probability of Jason being a CS professor = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors = 75 / 100 = 0.75.
   - \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 25 / 100 = 0.25.
   
3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a CS professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume that the likelihood of receiving a similar description for a professor from either field is the same (i.e. \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)). This assumption simplifies the computation because \( P(D) \) will be the same regardless of whether Jason is a CS or humanities professor, and thus will cancel out in Bayes' theorem.

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Given \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), the formula simplifies to:
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
   \]
   
Since \( P(C) = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = 0.25 \):
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
