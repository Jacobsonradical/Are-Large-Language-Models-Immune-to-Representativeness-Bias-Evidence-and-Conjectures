To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s how we can work this out step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   - Probability of a randomly chosen professor being from the humanities, \( P(H) \):
     \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to assess how likely it is, given Jason's description, that he could be from the computer science or the humanities group. However, since no specific information differentiating the groups is provided in the description, we have to assume that Jason's description (high ability, strong motivation, likable) is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors.

   So, we can assume:
   \[ P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(CS | \text{Description}) \):
     \[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]
   
   But since the description is equally likely regardless of the group and \( P(\text{Description}) \) is a normalization factor, we can simplify our calculation:
   \[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.75 \).

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
