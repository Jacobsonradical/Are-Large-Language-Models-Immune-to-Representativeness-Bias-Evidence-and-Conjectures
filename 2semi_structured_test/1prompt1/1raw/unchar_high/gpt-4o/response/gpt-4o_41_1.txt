To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

We are given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

Let D represent the description given for Jason. We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to evaluate \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description D, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming the description D (which is relatively neutral and could fit professors from either department) is equally likely for both, then:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Since we don't have specific data suggesting otherwise, we can consider \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \) to be equal, and due to normalization:
\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = k \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k \]

So, Bayes' Theorem gives us:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
