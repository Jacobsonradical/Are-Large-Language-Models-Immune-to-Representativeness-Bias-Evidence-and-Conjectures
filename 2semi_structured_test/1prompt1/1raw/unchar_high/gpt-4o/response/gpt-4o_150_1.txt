To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a random professor is from computer science (CS): \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that a random professor is from the humanities (H): \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We consider that the description doesn't give us significantly distinguishing information that would heavily sway us towards one group or the other. Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups:
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from CS: \( P(D | CS) \)
   - Probability of the description given that the professor is from H: \( P(D | H) \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}
     \]
   - Given our assumption that the description is equally likely for both CS and H professors (\( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \)), this simplifies to:
     \[
     P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
     \]
   - Substituting the prior probabilities:
     \[
     P(CS | D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
     \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
