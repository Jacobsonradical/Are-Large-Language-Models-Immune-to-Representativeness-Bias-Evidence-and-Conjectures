To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description fitting Jason's profile.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

First, let's establish our known quantities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability that the description fits any professor.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the description fitting the personality traits given is equally likely to be descriptive of both groups (since no probability data was given to differentiate them):
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = 1 \) (assuming the description could fit any of them equally).

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \) which can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

So we can now compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
