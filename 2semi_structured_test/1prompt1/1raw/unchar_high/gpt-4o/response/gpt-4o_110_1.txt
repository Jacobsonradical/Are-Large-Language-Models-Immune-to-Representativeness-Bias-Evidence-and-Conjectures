To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Number of computer science professors (C)**: 75
2. **Number of humanities professors (H)**: 25
3. **Total number of professors**: 100

Since Jason is chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. 

\[ P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Given that we have no additional information that distinguishes between the computer science professors and humanities professors in the description provided for Jason (beyond what we get from the priors), we simply rely on these priors.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(C|D) = P(C) = 0.75 \]

So,

 \{"probability": "0.75"\}
