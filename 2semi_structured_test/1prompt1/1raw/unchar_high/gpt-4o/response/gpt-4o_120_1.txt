To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates current probability to prior probability, and in this case, we need to take into account the base rates provided in the problem.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) as the event that we have received the given description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to determine \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\):
- \(P(C)\), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \(P(H)\), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

We also need to consider \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\), which are the probabilities of receiving the given description given that Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. However, the description doesn't strongly differentiate between the two types of professorsâ€”assumptions of personality traits, likelihoods, or other discriminating factors aren't provided.

So, we can consider \(P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1\) under the assumption that the description is equally likely to apply to both groups.

Now, we need to compute the overall probability of the description \(D\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Putting it all together using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
