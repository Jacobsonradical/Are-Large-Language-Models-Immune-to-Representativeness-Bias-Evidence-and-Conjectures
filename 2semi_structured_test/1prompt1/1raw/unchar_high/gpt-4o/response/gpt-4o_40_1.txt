To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant probabilities and use the information provided to compute the desired probability.

1. We know the total number of professors: 75 computer science (CS) professors and 25 humanities (H) professors.
2. A description is chosen at random from the 100 descriptions.

So, the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \(P(CS)\), is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \(P(H)\), is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We are given a description of Jason with certain characteristics. However, without knowing any specific likelihoods about how these characteristics are distributed between CS and humanities professors, we assume that the descriptions do not significantly favor one group over the other. Therefore, the likelihoods \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\) are assumed to be equally likely given our lack of specific information.

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute the posterior probability \(P(CS | D)\):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\) are assumed to be equally likely, let's denote \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = k\). Then:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k (0.75 + 0.25) = k \]

Thus, \(P(D) = k\), and Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
