To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jasonâ€™s description.

First, let's define and calculate each term:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \)** (that Jason is a humanities professor):
   - There are 25 humanities professors and 100 professors in total.
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Probability \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - Without any specific information differentiating the description distribution between computer science and humanities, we assume equal likelihood for the high ability, strong motivation, and positive reputation among both groups. Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 1 \).

4. **Probability \( P(B|\neg A) \)**:
   - Similarly, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 1 \).

Now we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{0.75} \]
