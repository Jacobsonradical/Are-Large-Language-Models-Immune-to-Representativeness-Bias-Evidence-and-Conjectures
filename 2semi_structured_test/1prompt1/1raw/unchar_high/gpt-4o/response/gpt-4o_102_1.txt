To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given that we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 75/100, and for humanities, it is 25/100.

Bayes' theorem formula for this problem can be written as:

\[ \text{Probability(Jason is from CS | Description)} = \frac{\text{Probability(Description | CS)} \times \text{Probability(CS)}}{\text{Probability(Description)}} \]

However, since the same kind of description can apply to professors from both fields, we assume the probability of having such a description is equally likely for professors from both fields. Thus:

\[ \text{Probability(Description | CS)} = \text{Probability(Description | Humanities)} \]

Under this uniform assumption, the distribution of this description over our sample reflects the ratio of computer science professors to humanities professors in the study.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor simplifies to the base rate:

\[ \text{Probability(Jason is from CS)} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability is:

\[ {"probability": "0.75"} \]
