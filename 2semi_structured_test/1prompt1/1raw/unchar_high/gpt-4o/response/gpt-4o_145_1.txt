To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \(  C \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(  H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(  D \) : The description of Jason we have been given.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly,

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given that the description \(D\) is chosen at random from the total population of professors, and assuming there is no detailed information provided about bias in the descriptions, we can infer that:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Under this assumption, the ratio of these probabilities depends particularly on the base rates of \(C\) and \(H\) in the sample. The priors \(P(C)\) and \(P(H)\) are computed from the given numbers:

- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Thus,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
