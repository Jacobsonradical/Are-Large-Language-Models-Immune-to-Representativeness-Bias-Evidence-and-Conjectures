To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we need to identify and apply the relevant base rates (priors) and assess how likely Jason's description would be if he were a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

First, let's set the numbers from the study:
- Number of computer science professors: \( N_{CS} = 75 \)
- Number of humanities professors: \( N_{H} = 25 \)
- Total number of professors: \( N_{Total} = 100 \)

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across both categories, which we will use as a normalizing factor.

Assuming the description does not favor one field over the other and that the description is equally likely for both fields, the probabilities \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \) cancel out, making them equal.

Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) simplifies to the ratio of the prior probabilities.

Thus,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(H)}, \]

where:
- \( P(A) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Applying these values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
