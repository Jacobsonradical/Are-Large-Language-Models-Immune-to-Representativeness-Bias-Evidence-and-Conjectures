To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, letâ€™s define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is described in the given way.

To compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need:
- \( P(A) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability of the description (B) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): the total probability of the description happening.

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

The total number of professors is \( 75 + 25 = 100 \), so the prior probability \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description of Jason applies equally likely to professors in both fields, then \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) (where \( \neg A \) denotes the event that Jason is a humanities professor) are likely to be equal. In other words, any description chosen at random is as likely to come from a computer science professor as it is from a humanities professor.

Thus, if we denote this common probability by \( P(B) \), and knowing that the description was randomly chosen, \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

Now to find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Given that \( P(A) = 0.75 \) and \( P(\neg A) = 0.25 \), 

\( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)

But \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), and since they are proportions of the total number:

Let's assume \( P(B|A) \) simplifies as:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{n_{cs}}{total \, descriptions} \]
This equation becomes:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} \]

Using these numbers:

So \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \):
\[ P(B) = \left(\frac{75}{100}\right) \cdot 0.75 + \left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5625 + 0.0625 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.125 \cdot 1 \]

If we correct it:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{total} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{Total Prop.} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{45}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus, a straightforward possible correction is:
\[ {"probability": "0.75"}
