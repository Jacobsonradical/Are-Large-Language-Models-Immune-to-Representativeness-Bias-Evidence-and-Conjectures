Given the problem description, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the description of Jason.

We want to compute \( P(A | B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( B \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, we need to determine:

1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B | A) \), the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description.

**Step 1: Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**

We know there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

\[
P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

**Step 2: Likelihood \( P(B | A) \)** and \( P(B | \neg A) \)

Assuming the description of Jason is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors due to the absence of specific distinguishing traits in the given description.

\[
P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A)
\]

**Step 3: Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**

The overall probability \( P(B) \) is a weighted sum of the two possible scenarios:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Since \( P(B | A) \) is equal to \( P(B | \neg A) \), let this common value be denoted as \( k \).

\[
P(B) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot 0.75 + k \cdot 0.25 = k
\]

Given that \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \) are equal,

\[
P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) = P(B)
\]

So,

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\}
\]
