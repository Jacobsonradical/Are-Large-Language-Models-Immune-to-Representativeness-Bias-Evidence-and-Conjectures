To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- There are 75 computer science professors, and 25 humanities professors.
  
We need to determine \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Here:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Without additional specific information about how unique Jason's described characteristics are to computer science or humanities professors, we'll assume the description is equally likely for both groups, so \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\).

Considering that \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are approximately equal, we have:

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Thus:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 = P(D|C) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = P(D|C) \cdot 1 \]

So, \(P(D) = P(D|C)\). Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.75}{P(D|C)} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75 or 75%.

Here is the requested probability in the specified format:
