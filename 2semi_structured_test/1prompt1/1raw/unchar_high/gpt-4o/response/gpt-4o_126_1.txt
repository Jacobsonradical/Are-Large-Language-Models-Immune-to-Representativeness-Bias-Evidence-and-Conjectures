To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Given description of Jason.

We're interested in finding \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Since we have no reason based on the description to favor one field over the other (no specific distinguishing features given in the description), we'll assume that the probability of the description \(D\) is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors:

- \(P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1\) 

Using Bayes' theorem, we then have:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where the total probability \(P(D)\) is:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \]

Substituting the values back into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
