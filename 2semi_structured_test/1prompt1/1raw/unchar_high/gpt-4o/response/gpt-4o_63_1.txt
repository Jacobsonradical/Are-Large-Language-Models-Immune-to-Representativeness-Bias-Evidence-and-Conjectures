To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the description overall.

Let's denote:
- \( A_{\text{CS}} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{\text{Humanities}} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
  
From the problem, we know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

First, find \( P(A_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) \):
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to assume that the description is equally likely to describe either a computer science or a humanities professor, so \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \), but this term cancels out in Bayes' theorem because we are dealing with a ratio, so we can ignore it for our purposes.

Now, calculate \( P(B) \), which is the probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) P(A_{\text{Humanities}}) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot 0.75 + P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \cdot 0.25 \]

Again, since the probabilities of description given either category are the same, \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) = P(B|A_{\text{Humanities}}) \):
\[ P(B) = \alpha \cdot 0.75 + \alpha \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = \alpha \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = \alpha \]

So, in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{\alpha \cdot 0.75}{\alpha} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} } \]
