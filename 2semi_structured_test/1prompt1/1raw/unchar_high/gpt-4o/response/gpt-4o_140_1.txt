First, let's analyze the given information:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100 (75 + 25).

To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. However, since the description does not provide any distinguishing characteristics that could allow us to differentiate between professors of different departments, we will use the basic principles of probability. 

Here's the calculation:

The probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the computer science department is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, given no additional distinguishing information from the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
