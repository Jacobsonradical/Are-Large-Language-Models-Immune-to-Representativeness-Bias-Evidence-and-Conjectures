To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is how we proceed step-by-step:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Given Information:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - A person is chosen at random from 100 professors.

3. **Initial (Prior) Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

4. **Description:**
   The description provided does not give specific information unique to either the computer science or humanities professors. Without further distinguishing information, we assume the likelihood of Jason having the given description is equally probable for both groups.

5. **Equal Likelihood Assumption:**
   This means that \( P(\text{Description} \mid C) = P(\text{Description} \mid H) \). Let's denote this common probability by \( P(\text{Description}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description} \mid C) = P(\text{Description} \mid H) \), the term \( P(\text{Description}) \) is factored as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot 0.75 + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ = P(\text{Description}) \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) \]
\[ = P(\text{Description}) \cdot 1 \]
\[ = P(\text{Description}) \]

So, simplifying:
\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} \]
\[ = \frac{0.75}{1} \]
\[ = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

The answer should be formatted as required:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
