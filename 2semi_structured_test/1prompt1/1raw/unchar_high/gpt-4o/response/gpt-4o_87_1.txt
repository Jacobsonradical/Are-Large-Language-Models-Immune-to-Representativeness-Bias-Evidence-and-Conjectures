To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We know the following from the problem:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since we are choosing the description at random, we assume that each description within each group is equally likely. Therefore:

- \( P(D|C) = \frac{1}{75} \)
- \( P(D|H) = \frac{1}{25} \)

Now let's find \( P(D) \), the total probability of getting the description \( D \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(D) = \frac{1}{75} \cdot 0.75 + \frac{1}{25} \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{0.25}{25} = \frac{0.75}{75} + \frac{1}{100} \]
\[ P(D) = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{\frac{1}{75} \cdot 0.75}{0.02} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{75 \cdot 0.02} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{1.5} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.5 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.5.

In the required format:
