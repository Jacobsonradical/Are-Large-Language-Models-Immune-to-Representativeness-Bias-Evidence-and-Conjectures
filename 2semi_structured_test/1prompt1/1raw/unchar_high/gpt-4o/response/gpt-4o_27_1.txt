To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we would use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's how this can be calculated:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - You are given:
     - \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
     - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Probabilistic assumption:**
   - Since we have no additional specific information about the probability of getting such a description from either group, we assume the description of being high ability, strong motivation, and well-liked is equally likely among both computer science and humanities professors.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   - The probability we are interested in, \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the given description, is calculated using:
     \[
     P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
     \]
     Since description \( D \) is assumed equally likely among both groups:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( P(D|C) \) (probability of description given computer science) = 1 (assuming equally likely)
     - \( P(D|H) \) (probability of description given humanities) = 1 (assuming equally likely)

     Thus:
     \[
     P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
     \]

4. **Computing the final probability:**
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
