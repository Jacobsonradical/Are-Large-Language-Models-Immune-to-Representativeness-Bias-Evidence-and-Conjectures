To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The provided description fits Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the description fits any professor.

Since the description appears equally likely for any professor in the sample, we can assume:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B) \]

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, giving a total of 100 professors.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of picking a computer science professor out of all professors:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(B|A) \) can be considered equal to 1 because the description does not specify any particular predisposition or unique trait separating computer science professors from humanities professors under the given context.

Considering \( P(B) \) is the probability of picking any professor fitting the description, and assuming all descriptions are equally likely:
\[ P(B) = 1 \]

Given the above information, we find:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
