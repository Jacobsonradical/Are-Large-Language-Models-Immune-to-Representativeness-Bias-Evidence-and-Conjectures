To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason has the given description.

We want to find \(\Pr(A|B)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
\Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(B|A) \cdot \Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)}
\]

We start by setting up the numbers given in the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

This gives the prior probabilities:
\[
\Pr(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \quad \text{and} \quad \Pr(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

The description of Jason does not provide specific information that differs between computer science and humanities professors, so we assume \(\Pr(B|A) = \Pr(B|A^c) = \Pr(B)\). This assumption implies that:

\[
\Pr(B) = \Pr(B|A) \cdot \Pr(A) + \Pr(B|A^c) \cdot \Pr(A^c)
\]

Since \(\Pr(B|A) = \Pr(B|A^c)\), these probabilities cancel out in the Bayes' Theorem, simplifying the equation to just considering the priors:

\[
\Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A)}{\Pr(A) + \Pr(A^c)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{1} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
