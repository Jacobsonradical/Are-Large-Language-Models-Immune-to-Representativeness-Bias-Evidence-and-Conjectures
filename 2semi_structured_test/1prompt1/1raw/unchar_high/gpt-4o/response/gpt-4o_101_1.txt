To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case boils down to comparing the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample of 100 professors. Therefore, the probability \( P(CS) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And the probability \( P(H) \) that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since we are given no additional information that discriminates between professors of the two disciplines based on the description of Jason, we assume the description applies equally to computer science and humanities professors. Thus, the likelihoods for the description, given that the professor belongs to either field, remain proportional to their respective base rates.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be directly determined by the proportions:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = P(CS) = 0.75 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
