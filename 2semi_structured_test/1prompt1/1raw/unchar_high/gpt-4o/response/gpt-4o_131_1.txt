To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to compute \( P(CS|desc) \).

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   We assume that the description provided is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. This means:
   - \( P(desc|CS) = P(desc|H) \)

3. **Total Probability of the description:**
   \[
   P(desc) = P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(desc|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Given \( P(desc|CS) = P(desc|H) \), we can denote \( P(desc|CS) = k \). So:
   \[
   P(desc) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) = k \cdot (0.75 + 0.25) = k
   \]

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(desc)}
   \]
   Substituting the terms:
   \[
   P(CS|desc) = \frac{k \cdot 0.75}{k} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
