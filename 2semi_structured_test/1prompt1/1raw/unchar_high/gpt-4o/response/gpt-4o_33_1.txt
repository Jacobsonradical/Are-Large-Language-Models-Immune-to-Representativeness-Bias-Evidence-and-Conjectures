To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this context, the theorem can be used to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, let's define some notations:
- \( C \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( S \) is the event of having such a description.

We are interested in \( P(C|S) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|S) = \frac{P(S|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(S)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(S|C) \) is the probability of having such a description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(S) \) is the overall probability of having such a description.

Let's calculate each component step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
For simplicity, let's assume the descriptions are equally likely (as we are not given specific descriptions that favor one group over the other):

   - \( P(S|C) \approx 1 \) (assuming that any given description applies equally since we lack details that might differentiate between fields)
   - \( P(S|H) \approx 1 \)

3. **Overall Probability \(P(S)\):**
\[ P(S) = P(S|C) \cdot P(C) + P(S|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(S) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 \]

Now, substituting these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|S) = \frac{P(S|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(S)} \]
\[ P(C|S) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Therefore, the answer is:
