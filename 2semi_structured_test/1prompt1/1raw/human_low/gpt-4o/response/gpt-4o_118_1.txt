To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Number of computer science professors = 25
   - Number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 25 + 75 = 100

   - Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to consider how likely someone with Jason's description is to belong to each group. Since the problem doesn't provide explicit likelihoods, we make an informed assumption based on the description that includes being "not particularly technical", "creative", and "emotionally driven". These traits are typically less associated with computer science professors and more with humanities professors.
   
   Let's assume:
   - Likelihood that Jason's description matches a computer science professor (P(Description|CS)) = 0.1 (This value needs to be subjectively estimated based on the provided description.)
   - Likelihood that Jason's description matches a humanities professor (P(Description|Hum)) = 0.9 

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

   Now calculate the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
