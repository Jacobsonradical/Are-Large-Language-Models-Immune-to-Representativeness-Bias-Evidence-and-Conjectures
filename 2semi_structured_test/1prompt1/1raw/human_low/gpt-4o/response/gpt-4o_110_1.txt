To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Here are the steps to solve for the probability:

1. Define the events:
   - \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(B\): Jason fits the given description.

2. Find the prior probabilities:
   - \(P(A)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - \(P(\neg A)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is not from computer science (is from the humanities) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

3. Assess the likelihoods:
   - \(P(B|A)\): The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \(P(B|\neg A)\): The probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

Since the description suggests that Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical," this description is less likely to fit a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor. We can reasonably estimate:
   - \(P(B|A)\) to be lower.
   - \(P(B|\neg A)\) to be higher.

However, without specific numerical values for these probabilities, we continue with the general Bayesian formula.

4. Use Bayes' theorem to get:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} 
\]

First, compute \( P(B) \) which is the total probability of the description (regardless of the field):
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substituting:
- \(P(B|A)\) as an estimate (e.g., 0.1 for computer science).
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) as an estimate (e.g., 0.5 for humanities).

\[
P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.5 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.375 = 0.4
\]

Then,
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} = \frac{0.025}{0.4} = 0.0625
\]

So the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\{
  "probability": "0.0625"
\}
