To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability based on new evidence. Here, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

We start with the following:

- The prior probability of selecting a professor randomly from each group:
  - There are 25 computer science professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - There are 75 humanities professors: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to compare the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Because we do not have specific likelihoods, we assume likelihood is based on the relative sizes of each group.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(Hum | D) = \frac{P(D | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(D)} \]

Given the assumption that both groups are equally likely to match Jason's description, we have \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | Hum) \). With equal likelihoods, these cancel out:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Note: This result is reached under an assumption of equal likelihood of Jason's description in each group, which may not perfectly mirror real-world statistics.

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{0.25} ]

Returning this result in the requested format:
