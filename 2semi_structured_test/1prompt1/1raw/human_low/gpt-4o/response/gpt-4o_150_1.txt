To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we need to determine \( P(CS|D) \), where \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( D \) is the description provided.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(CS) \)
2. \( P(D|CS) \)
3. \( P(D) \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(CS) \)
\( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Given 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(D|CS) \)
\( P(D|CS) \) is the probability that a description like Jason's would be given if he is a computer science professor. Without specific information on how likely it is for the description to apply to computer science professors, we will assume that every professor is equally likely to be described in this way. This is a simplifying assumption.

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(D) \)
\( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description being provided regardless of whether the professor is from computer science or humanities. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Where \( P(H) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Again, assuming equal likelihood of such descriptions for simplicity:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = k \), a constant that cancels out in the Bayes' formula.

Then, \( P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \)

So, the Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, under the simplifying assumption of equal likelihood for the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor remains the prior probability:
