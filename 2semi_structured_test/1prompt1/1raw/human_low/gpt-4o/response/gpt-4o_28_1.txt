To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and can be stated as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B is true.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that event A is true.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

Here, let's define:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: The description given for Jason.

We need to find P(A|B):

1. Prior probability P(A): 
The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Total number of professors = 100
So, P(A) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. P(~A):
The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is 1 - P(A):
- Number of humanities professors = 75
So, P(~A) = 75/100 = 0.75

3. Likelihood P(B|A):
The probability of Jason matching the given description if he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, Jason does not seem to have traits typically associated with a technical field like computer science. Let's denote this as low; for simplicity, let's hypothesize a subjective probability:
P(B|A) = 0.1 (assumed because the description does not align well with typical computer science traits)

4. Likelihood P(B|~A):
The probability of Jason matching the given description if he is a humanities professor. Based on the description, he has traits that are more common in the humanities. Let's denote this as high:
P(B|~A) = 0.4 (assumed because the description fits better with typical humanities traits)

So, we need to calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Let's calculate each component:
- P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.1 * 0.25 = 0.025
- P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.4 * 0.75 = 0.3

Therefore:
P(B) = 0.025 + 0.3 = 0.325

Now we can plug these into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.1 * 0.25] / 0.325 = 0.025 / 0.325 â‰ˆ 0.077

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
