To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(A_{CS}|B) \).

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors (\( n_{CS} \)) = 25.
- Number of humanities professors (\( n_{H} \)) = 75.
- Total number of professors (\( n_{T} \)) = \( n_{CS} + n_{H} = 100 \).

Prior probability \( P(A_{CS}) \):
\[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{n_{CS}}{n_{T}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior probability \( P(A_{H}) \):
\[ P(A_{H}) = \frac{n_{H}}{n_{T}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assume \( P(B|A_{CS}) \): Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.

Assume \( P(B|A_{H}) \): Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.

Given the nature of Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate but not technical), it is reasonable to assume that such a profile is more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's assume:

\[ P(B|A_{CS}) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(B|A_{H}) \approx 0.3 \]

Total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = 0.1 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.1"}} \]
