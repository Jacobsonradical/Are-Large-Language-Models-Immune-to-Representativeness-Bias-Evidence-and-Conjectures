To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description occurring if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description occurring, regardless of whether he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Given the problem information:

1. Number of computer science professors (\( n_{\mathrm{CS}} \)) = 25
2. Number of humanities professors (\( n_{\mathrm{H}} \)) = 75
3. Total number of professors (\( n_{\mathrm{total}} \)) = 100

Thus, the prior probability (\( P(A) \)) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{n_{\mathrm{CS}}}{n_{\mathrm{total}}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability (\( P(\neg A) \)) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{n_{\mathrm{H}}}{n_{\mathrm{total}}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The description given suggests that Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, and this might bias our thinking towards a humanities professor. Therefore, we need to consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

If we assume that the description is more likely to apply to humanities professors than computer science professors, let's assign:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.2 \]  (an arbitrary but reasonable low probability given that the description does not strongly align with typical perceived traits of computer science professors),
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \] (a high probability consistent with the description aligning with typical traits of humanities professors).

Now, we can compute \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.
