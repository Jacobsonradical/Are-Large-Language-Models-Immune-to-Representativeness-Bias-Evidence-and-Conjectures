To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- We have 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H).
- This implies that the initial probability (prior probability) of a selected description being of a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Similarly, the initial probability of a selected description being of a humanities professor is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we must consider how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor (likelihood of data given CS, \( P(D|CS) \)) versus a humanities professor (likelihood of data given H, \( P(D|H) \)).

Given the description:
- Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring - these traits might be observed more frequently in humanities professors than in computer science professors.

Although we don't have exact values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), let's consider:
- It is plausible to assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is quite low because these traits are less typical for computer science professors.
- \( P(D|H) \) is reasonably high given that these traits align more with the profile of a humanities professor.

Since we lack exact data, we'll reasonably estimate:
- Assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \)
- Assume \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \)

Using Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{ P(D) }
\]

Where \( P(D) \) (overall probability of the description) can be computed as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in values:
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Then,
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
