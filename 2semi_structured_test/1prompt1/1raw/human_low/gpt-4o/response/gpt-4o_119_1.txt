To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- \( P(CS) \) : The prior probability that an individual is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) : The prior probability that an individual is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) : The likelihood of the description given that the individual is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) : The likelihood of the description given that the individual is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS|D) \) : The posterior probability that an individual is a computer science professor given the description.

Given data:
- Total number of professors = 100.
- Number of computer science professors \( = 25 \).
- Number of humanities professors \( = 75 \).

We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( P(CS|D) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on the description, it is more likely that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. However, without precise likelihood values, we can use the prior probabilities and an informal assessment.

Let's use the given numbers to find \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming \( P(D|CS) \) is much lower than \( P(D|H) \) but we will use a rough estimation that \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \), since Jason's description fits more likely into humanities.

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is roughly 0.0769.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.0769"}
