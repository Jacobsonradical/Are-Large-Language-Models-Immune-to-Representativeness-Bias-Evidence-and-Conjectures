To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how you calculate it step by step:

1. **Identify the prior probabilities**:
   - The probability (P(CS)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is 25/100.
   - The probability (P(H)) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is 75/100.

2. **Determine the likelihoods**:
   - Letâ€™s denote the event that Jason is described by "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, not particularly technical" as E.
   - We need to estimate how likely a computer science professor (P(E|CS)) or a humanities professor (P(E|H)) would fit Jason's description.

   Given Jason's description, it is more likely that this description fits a humanities professor, but to solve this mathematically, we need exact probabilities which we don't have. However, for demonstration purposes, let's assume:
   - P(E|CS) (probability that a computer science professor fits this description) might be quite low, say 0.1.
   - P(E|H) (probability that a humanities professor fits this description) might be higher, say 0.9.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of event E, which can be expanded as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Now, substituting the known values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(E) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

So,

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0357.

In the required format:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
