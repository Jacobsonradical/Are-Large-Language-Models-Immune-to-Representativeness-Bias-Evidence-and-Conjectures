To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The given description fits Jason.

We want to find \(P(C \mid D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

We need to calculate each part of this formula.

- \(P(C)\) = prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H)\) = prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need \(P(D \mid C)\) and \(P(D \mid H)\):

\(D\), the description, suggests creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and being non-technical. These traits are generally more common in humanities professors than in computer science professors. 

Therefore, to estimate the probabilities:

- Assume \(P(D \mid C)\), the probability of this description for a computer science professor, might be relatively low. Let's estimate it at 0.1 (10%).
- Assume \(P(D \mid H)\), the probability of this description for a humanities professor, might be relatively high. Let's estimate it at 0.7 (70%).

Finally, we need \(P(D)\), the overall probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.7 \cdot 0.75)\]
\[P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525\]
\[P(D) = 0.55\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55}\]
\[P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55}\]
\[P(C \mid D) \approx 0.0455\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0455.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0455"}
