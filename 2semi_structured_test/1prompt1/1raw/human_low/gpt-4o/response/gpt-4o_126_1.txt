To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = The given description of Jason.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the 100 professors is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the 100 professors is a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which represent the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

We don't have specific probabilities for these likelihoods based on the description, but we can make a reasonable assumption based on the given details:

- The description indicates that Jason is creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and not particularly technicalâ€”all traits more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors.

Assuming:
- \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood that the described traits fit a computer science professor, is relatively low. Let's estimate this as \( 0.1 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood that the described traits fit a humanities professor, is relatively high. Let's estimate this as \( 0.9 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
