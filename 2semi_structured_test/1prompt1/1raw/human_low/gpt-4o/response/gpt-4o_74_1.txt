To compute this probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (\(CS\)): 25
- Number of humanities professors (\(H\)): 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Bayes' theorem formula we use is:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor, which is \( 25/100 = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since we don't have exact probabilities of the description for each group (\( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \)), we assume that this prior description matches more closely typical humanities professors (given his creative and not particularly technical attributes), thus generally:
- \( P(D|CS) \) will be lower than \(P(D|H)\).

If we assume that most humanities professors have descriptions like Jason's and few computer science professors do, then we are likely to encounter descriptions like Jasonâ€™s mostly in the humanities sample rather than the computer science sample.

Thus:

1. \( P(CS) = 0.25 \)

Without specific likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), if we take a reasonable assumption, for instance:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (approximate chance of computer science professor having this description)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \) (approximate chance of humanities professor having this description)

Then we compute \( P(D) \) as follows:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS)P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

Hence the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.0357\).

So our answer would be:
\[
{"probability": "0.0357"}
\]
