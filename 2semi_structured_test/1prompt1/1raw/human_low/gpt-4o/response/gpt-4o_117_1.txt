To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here is a summary of how it would be approached:

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) and a humanities professor (P(H)):
   - P(CS) = Number of CS professors / Total number of professors = 25/100 = 0.25
   - P(H) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75/100 = 0.75
   
2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the given description being more typical for CS or humanities professors. Given that the description mentioned non-technical aspects like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, traveling, reading, and exploration, these traits might lean more typical for someone in the humanities.

3. **Posterior Probability**: The probability that, given the description, Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS|D)). 

Since we don't have exact figures for the likelihood of the given description matching with professors from the CS or humanities, let's denote:
- P(D|CS) as the probability of the description if Jason is a CS professor.
- P(D|H) as the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description seems to fit humanities more, let's assume the following subjective likelihoods:
- P(D|CS) = 0.1
- P(D|H) = 0.9

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(CS|D):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability is â‰ˆ 0.0357 or approximately 3.57%.
