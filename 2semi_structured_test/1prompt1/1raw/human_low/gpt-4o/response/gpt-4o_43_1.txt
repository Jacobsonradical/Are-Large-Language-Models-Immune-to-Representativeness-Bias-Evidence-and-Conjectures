To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let me break down the problem.

We have the following information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- A total of 100 descriptions.
- We are trying to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's define the probabilities as follows:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability of picking a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = Probability of picking a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

Next, consider Jason's description. To apply Bayes' theorem, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(D|CS) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

To complete the calculation, we should ideally have these conditional probabilities. However, given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical"), it seems more aligned with typical characteristics of the humanities rather than computer science. 

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the likelihood \( P(D|CS) \) is lower compared to \( P(D|H) \). Letâ€™s assign these:

- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.5 \)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.5 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.375} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.0625 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:
