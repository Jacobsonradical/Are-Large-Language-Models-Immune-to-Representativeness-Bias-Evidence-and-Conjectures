To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood of the description \( D \) under each hypothesis**:
   - Assume \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Assume \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given that Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying reading and exploring, and not particularly technical, it is more likely that this description fits a humanities professor than a computer science professor. 

For simplicity, let's assume these probabilities:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \)

3. **Total probability of the description \( D \)**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.7 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.525 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.55 \]

4. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem**:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0455 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0455.
