First, let's outline the relevant information and compute the probability using Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science (CS) professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason is described with certain personality traits.

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the event that Jason has the given description.

We want to compute \( P(C|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to consider:
- \( P(C) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group.
- \( P(D|C) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

First, compute the priors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without more specific information about \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we must make reasonable assumptions. Jason's description emphasizes creativity, imagination, and lack of technicality, which may correlate more with humanities professors. To proceed, we'll assume:

\[ P(D|C) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

The total probability \( P(D) \) can be found as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can compute \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{ {"probability": "0.0769"} } \]
