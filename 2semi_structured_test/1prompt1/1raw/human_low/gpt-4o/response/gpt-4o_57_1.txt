To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we formulate the problem:

1. **Define events**:
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): The given description of Jason.

2. **Known values**:
   - \( P(A) \): Probability of selecting a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25.
   - \( P(B) \): Probability of selecting a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75.

3. **We need**:
   - \( P(A|D) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

4. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
   \]

5. **Estimations**:
   We need to estimate \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \):
   - \( P(D|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|B) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since Jason's description entails qualities such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, and not particularly technical, it appears to be more aligned with typical humanities characteristics rather than computer science.

Assuming:
   - \( P(D|A) \approx 0.2 \) (computer science professors are less likely to have this description).
   - \( P(D|B) \approx 0.8 \) (humanities professors are more likely to have this description).

Now, compute \( P(D) \):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.

\[
\text{{"probability": "0.077"}}
\]
