To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, Jason being a computer science professor) based on given evidence (his description).

Bayes' theorem formula is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of hypothesis \( A \) (Jason being a computer science professor) given the evidence \( B \) (Jason's description).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of evidence \( B \) given that hypothesis \( A \) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis \( A \) (i.e., the initial probability of Jason being a computer science professor).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood of evidence \( B \) (the overall probability of observing Jason's description).

Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A_{CS}) \) = Probability of being a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(A_{H}) \) = Probability of being a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) = Probability of having Jason's description given he is a CS professor.
   - \( P(B|A_{H}) \) = Probability of having Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have specific data for \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \), let's make an informed assumption: Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it is more likely that he matches the profile of a humanities professor. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:
   - \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) = 0.2 (given that Jason's traits are less typical for CS professors)
   - \( P(B|A_{H}) \) = 0.8 (given that Jason's traits are more typical for humanities professors)

3. **Marginal Likelihood** (\( P(B) \)):
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \)

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - \( P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \)
   - \( P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \)
   - \( P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \)
   - \( P(A_{CS}|B) \approx 0.0769 \)

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.0769.
