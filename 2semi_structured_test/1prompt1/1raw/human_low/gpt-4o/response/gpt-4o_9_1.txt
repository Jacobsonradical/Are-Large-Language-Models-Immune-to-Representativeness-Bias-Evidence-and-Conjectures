To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down step by step:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Let \( D \) be the event that the description matches Jason.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need \( P(D|C) \), the probability of the description matching a computer science professor.
   - We need \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description matching a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason as creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, combined with the fact that he is not particularly technical, it is more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. However, the exact values of \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) would generally be needed for precise calculation, but assuming the description is more common among humanities professors, let's estimate the likelihoods:

- Suppose \( P(D|C) \approx 0.2 \) (somewhat arbitrarily suggesting it is less common among computer science professors).
- Suppose \( P(D|H) \approx 0.8 \) (suggesting it is more common among humanities professors).

4. **Bayesâ€™ Theorem:**

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Finally, compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
