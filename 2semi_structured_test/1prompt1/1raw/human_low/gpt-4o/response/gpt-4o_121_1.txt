To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

Given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We do not have \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) directly. However, we can infer those based on the description given. Jason's description seems more consistent with characteristics typically associated with humanities professors, such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying reading and exploring. Humanities professors are more likely to exhibit these traits than computer science professors who might be more technical.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) \approx 0.2 \)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.8 \)

Now we can find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can compute \( P(C | D) \):
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0769"}
