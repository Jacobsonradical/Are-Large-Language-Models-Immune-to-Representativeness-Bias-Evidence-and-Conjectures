To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(C) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:
     \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

   - \( P(H) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - To accurately determine \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we would need detailed statistics on how likely the given description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, based on the description provided, it leans more towards traits typical of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) rather than technical.
   
   - Suppose we make an educated guess based on typical stereotype alignments: Let's assume:
     \[ P(D \mid C) = 0.1 \]
     \[ P(D \mid H) = 0.9 \]

3. **Total Probability of the Description:**
   - Using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
     \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
     \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
     \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
   \[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.036 \]

Rounding to a more familiar decimal form, we get approximately 0.036.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
