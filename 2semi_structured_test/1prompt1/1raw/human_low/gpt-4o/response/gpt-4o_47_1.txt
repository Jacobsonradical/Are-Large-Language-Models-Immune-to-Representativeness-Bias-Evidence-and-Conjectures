To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem in this context states:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

where:
- \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description being given to a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from the computer science department.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break down these components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**:
   There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \)**:
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \)**:
   The given description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical) seems more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. However, since we don't have specific probabilities for these descriptions, we'll make a reasonable assumption based on the nature of the traits described. Let's assume:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.1 \quad \text{(10% chance this description fits a CS professor)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \quad \text{(90% chance this description fits a Humanities professor)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(\text{Description}) \)**:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(\text{Description}) }
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.7 }
\]
\[
P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{ 0.025 }{ 0.7 } \approx 0.035714
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0357.
