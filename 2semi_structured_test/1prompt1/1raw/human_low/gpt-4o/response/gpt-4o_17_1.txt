To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): the description given for Jason.

We are asked to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find each component:

1. **\( P(C) \):** The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **\( P(H) \):** The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **\( P(D|C) \):** The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - This is not directly provided in the problem, so let's assume it is relatively low because the description suggests he is not particularly technical (which is more expected for humanities professors).

4. **\( P(D|H) \):** The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
   - This is also not directly provided in the problem, but let's assume it is relatively high because the description is closely associated with traits more common among humanities professors.

5. **\( P(D): \)** The total probability of the description, which can be calculated as:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

For simplicity, let's define \( P(D|C) = x \) and \( P(D|H) = y \).
- Since we are more inclined to associate the description with a humanities professor, let's set \( x = 0.1 \) and \( y = 0.9 \).

Now, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Convert this to a probability in the required format:
\[ \text{{"probability"}}: "0.0357" \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357 or roughly 3.57%.
