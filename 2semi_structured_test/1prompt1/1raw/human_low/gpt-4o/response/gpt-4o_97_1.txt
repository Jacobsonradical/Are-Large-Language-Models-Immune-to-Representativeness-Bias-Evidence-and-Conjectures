To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason having his description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of Jason having his description regardless of his field.

Let's break it down using the provided data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(A') \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' Theorem requires us to know \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \), the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor and a humanities professor respectively. Since the description suggests non-technical and creative traits, we will assume these are more representative of humanities professors than computer science professors.

Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.1 \] (unlikely for a computer science professor to have this description)
\[ P(B|A') = 0.5 \] (more likely for a humanities professor to have this description)

The total probability of the description \( P(B) \) is given by:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Thus:

\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.5 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.375 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.4} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.0625 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.0625"}} \]
