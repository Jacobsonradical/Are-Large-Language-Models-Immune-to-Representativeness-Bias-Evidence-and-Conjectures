To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - Number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
    - Number of humanities professors (HUM) = 75
    - Total number of professors = 100
    - Prior probability that Jason is a CS professor, P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
    - Prior probability that Jason is a HUM professor, P(HUM) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**:
    We need to determine the likelihood of Jason’s personality given he is either a CS professor or a HUM professor.
    - Let’s denote the description of Jason as "D".
    Assuming the description fits more closely with a humanities professor based on traits like emotional, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical, we can assign approximate probabilities for likelihoods:
        - P(D|CS): Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a CS professor.
        - P(D|HUM): Likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a HUM professor.
    Given that the description fits better with a HUM professor, let's assume:
        - P(D|CS) ≈ 0.1
        - P(D|HUM) ≈ 0.9

3. **Posterior Probability**: 
    We use Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.

    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \times P(HUM)}
    \]

    Substituting the values:

    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75}
    \]

    Simplifying the denominator:

    \[
    P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} ≈ 0.0357
    \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

The answer in the required format is:
```json
{"probability": "0.0357"}
