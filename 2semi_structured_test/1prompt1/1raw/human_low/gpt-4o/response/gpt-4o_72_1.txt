To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' theorem is depicted as follows:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's find the prior probabilities \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) where \( H \) is being a humanities professor:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- So, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we must estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), i.e., the likelihood of the description given a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. Based on the description of Jason:
- Jason is described as "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted, passionate, not particularly technical."
- These traits seem generally more aligned with the profile of humanities professors rather than computer science professors. 

For the sake of this problem, letâ€™s assume the description matches humanities professors with a probability of \( 0.8 \) and computer science professors with a probability of \( 0.2 \).

Now, \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 * 0.25 + 0.8 * 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 * 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.077 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.077 \) or \( 7.7\% \).

Therefore, the answer is:
