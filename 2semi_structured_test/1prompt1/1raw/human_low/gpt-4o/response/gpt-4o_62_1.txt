To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the terms:

- Let \( CS \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) denote the event of Jason's description.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given the numbers in the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \),
and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assume that Jason's description is more likely to represent a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor based on the traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven). Letâ€™s say:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (since he is not particularly technical)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
