To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Here, our hypotheses are:
- \(H_{CS}\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H_{H}\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We'll denote E as the evidence provided by the description of Jason. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]

Similarly, we need to consider the probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(H_{H} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H})}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors, so \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors, so \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to make a reasonable assumption about \( P(E | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(E | H_{H}) \). The description provided for Jason seems to be more closely aligned with typical characteristics of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical). While these traits are not impossible for a computer science professor, they are likely less common.

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(E | H_{CS}) = 0.1 \) (Jason fits the description less often if he is a computer science professor)
- \( P(E | H_{H}) = 0.9 \) (Jason fits the description more often if he is a humanities professor)

We need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(E | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem for the probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) = \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ P(H_{CS} | E) \approx 0.036 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.04"}
