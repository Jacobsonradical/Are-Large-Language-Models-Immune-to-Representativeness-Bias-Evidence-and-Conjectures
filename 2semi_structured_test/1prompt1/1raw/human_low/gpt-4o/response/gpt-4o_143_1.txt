To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event given new evidence.

Bayes' theorem is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the description of Jason.

First, let's define the probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

To begin:
- \(P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \(P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, the critical part is estimating \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\).

Given the description of Jason as someone who is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical", it appears more typical of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. We might estimate:
- \(P(B|A)\) might be rather low (say, 0.2).
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) might be higher (say, 0.8).

Now using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(A|B)\):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]

To find \(P(B)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
Substituting in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.
