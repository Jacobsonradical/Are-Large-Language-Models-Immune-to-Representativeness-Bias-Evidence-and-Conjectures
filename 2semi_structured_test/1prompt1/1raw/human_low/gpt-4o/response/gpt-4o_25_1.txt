The problem given is a classic example of the base rate fallacy, where people's judgments are affected by prior probabilities (base rates) and specific evidence.

In this scenario, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

Here are the details we work with:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B| \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( \neg A \) = Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) = Jason's description.

We need:
- \( P(A) \) = Prior probability of being a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = Prior probability of being a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which are the probabilities of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor respectively. Given the description of Jason, it seems more aligned with the characteristics typically ascribed to humanities professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, which might be considered low, say \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, which might be higher, say \( 0.8 \).

Now substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{(0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.077"}
