To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here, we have:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The probability of the provided description.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the provided description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A|B) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

We calculate \( P(A|B) \) using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given the following information:
- Number of computer science professors (\( n_{CS} \)) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (\( n_{H} \)) = 75
- Total number of professors (\( n_{total} \)) = 100

The prior probability (\( P(A) \)) is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability (\( P(\neg A) \)) of being a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we also need:
\[ P(B|A) \] and \[ P(B|\neg A) \]

Because exact likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)) are not provided, we will proceed with a plausible but simplified assessment based on the information provided. Given Jason's description, especially the emphasis on creativity and a lack of technical inclination, it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

To make a simplified and reasonable estimation:
- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (a low probability since the description doesn't fit typical technical profiles).
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \) (a high probability given it fits the humanities profile better).

Now, we find \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the description):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.035714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.036"}} \]
