To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability that the description fits if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability that the description fits if the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): Probability that the description fits overall.

Firstly, we know:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Bayes' theorem tells us:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, to solve this, we need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description fitting a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively. The problem gives us a description that appears to have characteristics more commonly found among humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), so it is reasonable to assume that:

\[ P(D|CS) \] is low and \( P(D|H) \) is high.

Without exact numbers for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can assume that the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|CS) \), following the description provided.

For the sake of computation, let's make a reasonable estimation. Suppose:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.9 \]

We then compute \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{25}{700} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
