To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the detailed process:

We denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description provided (i.e., Jason's description).

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) since there are 25 computer science professors.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) since there are 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, given by:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the description, Jason is creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which seems less typical for a computer science professor and more typical for a humanities professor. This suggests:

- \( P(D | C) \) should be relatively low.
- \( P(D | H) \) should be relatively high.

However, we do not have exact information about these probabilities, so we need to make a reasonable estimate. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.2 \) (less likely, but not impossible for a computer science professor)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.8 \) (more likely for a humanities professor)

Now, we can solve for \( P(D) \) using these estimates:

\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Using these calculations, we can determine \( P(C | D) \):

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
