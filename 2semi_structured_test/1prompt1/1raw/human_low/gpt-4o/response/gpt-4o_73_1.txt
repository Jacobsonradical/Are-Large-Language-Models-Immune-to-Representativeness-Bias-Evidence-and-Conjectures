To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors \( P(CS) = 25 \)
- The number of humanities professors \( P(H) = 75 \)
- The total number = 100

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \): The probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

To simplify, letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \): The likelihood of a computer science professor having Jason's description.
- \( P(D | H) \): The likelihood of a humanities professor having Jason's description.

Since the description says Jason is not particularly technical, it seems more aligned with traits commonly associated with humanities rather than computer science. However, without specific likelihood values, it's challenging to quantify exact probabilities.

For calculating purposes, if we assume the description suits humanities professors more:

\( P(D | CS) \) could be considered low and \( P(D | H) \) high. But without specific values, we simplify with hypothetical probabilities.

For simplification, let's assume:

- \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \) (10% chance a computer science professor would fit this description)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.9 \) (90% chance a humanities professor would fit this description)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times \frac{25}{100}) + (0.9 \times \frac{75}{100}) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.0357 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0357.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
