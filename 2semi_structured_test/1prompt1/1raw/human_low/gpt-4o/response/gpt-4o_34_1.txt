To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

Let's define the probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \): The likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

From the given information:
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75
- Total professors = 100

Therefore:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we are told Jason is not particularly technical and more emotionally driven, creative, and imaginative, it is more likely he fits the stereotype of a humanities professor than a computer science professor. We'll denote:

\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.1 \] (assuming the description is less likely for a computer science professor)
\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.9 \] (assuming the description is more likely for a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Thus, the answer is: {"probability": "0.036"}
