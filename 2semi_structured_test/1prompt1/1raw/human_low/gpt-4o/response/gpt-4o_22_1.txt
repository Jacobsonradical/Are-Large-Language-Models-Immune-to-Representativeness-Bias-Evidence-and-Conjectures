Given the description of Jason, we need to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.

To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): Description of Jason

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, we determine the prior probabilities of Jason being a computer science professor or a humanities professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the likelihood of the description given each category. Without detailed distributions, we make an assumption based on the description:
- Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoying traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, but not particularly technical. This could suggest that he fits the stereotypical description of someone in the humanities more so than in computer science.

Therefore, we could intuitively assume:
\[ P(D | CS) = 0.1 \] (a lower likelihood, as he doesn't fit the typical technical profile of a computer science professor)
\[ P(D | H) = 0.9 \] (a higher likelihood, as he fits the stereotypical profile of humanities professors)

Now, we calculate the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can now calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:
\[ {"probability": "0.0357"} \]
