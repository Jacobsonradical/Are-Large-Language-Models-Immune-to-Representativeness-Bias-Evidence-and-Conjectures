To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on the evidence provided.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the hypotheses:**
   - \(H_{CS}\): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(H_{H}\): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Determine prior probabilities:**
   - \(P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - \(P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

3. **Determine the likelihoods:**
   - \(P(D|H_{CS})\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(D|H_{H})\): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we only have the description and not the detailed results of the personality tests for each group, we use the nature of the description to make an informed estimation. The description suggests characteristics that may be more common in humanities than in computer science given the emphasis on creativity and emotional drive.

For the sake of calculation, let's assume:
   - \(P(D|H_{CS}) = 0.2\) (since he does not seem particularly technical)
   - \(P(D|H_{H}) = 0.8\) (since he seems to fit more humanities-oriented traits)

4. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D|H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H_{CS}|D) \):

\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.
