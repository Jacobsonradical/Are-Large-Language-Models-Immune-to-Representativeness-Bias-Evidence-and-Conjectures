To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. According to Bayes' Theorem, the probability is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason's description was given.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total, \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(A')\) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total, \(P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods:
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A')\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason, it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor, as it describes him as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical. Without exact likelihood values, let's assume:
- \(P(B|A) \approx 0.2\) (a low probability given his profile is less typical for computer science professors).
- \(P(B|A') \approx 0.8\) (a higher probability given his profile is more typical for humanities professors).

Finally, we need to compute \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can compute \(P(A|B)\):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.
