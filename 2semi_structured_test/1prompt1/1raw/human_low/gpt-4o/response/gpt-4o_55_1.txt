To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**: The initial probability of picking a professor from computer science is 25 out of 100.
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability**: The initial probability of picking a professor from the humanities is 75 out of 100.
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \).
   - The likelihood of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

Given that Jason’s traits such as being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and not being particularly technical are more representative of the humanities profile, we can make a reasoned assumption:

   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9
   \]

4. **Total Probability of the Description**:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities})P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem to update the probability:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} ≈ 0.0357
   \]

Given our computed value, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.

Thus, the answer is:
```
{"probability": "0.036"}
```
