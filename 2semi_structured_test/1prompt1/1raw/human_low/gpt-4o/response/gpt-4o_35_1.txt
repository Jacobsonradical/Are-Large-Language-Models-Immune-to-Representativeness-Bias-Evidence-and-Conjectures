To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Below are the initial probabilities and the steps to compute the final probability.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability of selecting a computer science (CS) professor, \(P(CS)\):
     \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor, \(P(H)\):
     \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to assess the likelihood of the description fitting a CS professor versus a humanities professor. Based on the description of Jason, traits such as creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of technical emphasis suggest it is more likely for him to be a humanities professor. Without exact probabilities, we will assume the likelihood ratio based on qualitative analysis:
   - \(P(\text{description} | H) = 0.9\) (high likelihood Jason fits the description given the humanities sample)
   - \(P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.1\) (low likelihood Jason fits the description given the CS sample)

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \times P(H)
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
   \]
   
   Then:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
