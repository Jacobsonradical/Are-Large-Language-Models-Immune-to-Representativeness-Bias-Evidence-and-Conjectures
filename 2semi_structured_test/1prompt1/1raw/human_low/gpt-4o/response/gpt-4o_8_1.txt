To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. We need the following probabilities:
1. Probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)).
2. Probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)).
3. Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)).
4. Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)).

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- Probability of selecting a computer science professor:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- Probability of selecting a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, consider how likely the description is for computer science professors and humanities professors. Since the description indicates creativity, imagination, exploration, and a lack of technical emphasis, it may be more aligned with typical traits found among humanities professors. We will use subjective estimates for these probabilities:
- Probability of the description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) can be lower. Let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.2 \]
- Probability of the description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)) can be higher. Let's assume:
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75}
         = \frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.6}
         = \frac{0.05}{0.65}
         = \frac{5}{65}
         = \frac{1}{13}
         â‰ˆ 0.0769
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
