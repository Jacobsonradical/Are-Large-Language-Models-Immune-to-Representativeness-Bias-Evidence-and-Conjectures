To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \(A\) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \(B\) is the event "Jason fits the given description."

Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Prior Probability of Jason being a Computer Science Professor (\(P(A)\)):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Prior Probability of Jason being a Humanities Professor (\(P(A^c)\)):**
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \(P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

3. **Likelihood of the Description given Jason is a Computer Science Professor (\(P(B|A)\)):**
   - The description emphasizes creativity, imagination, passion, and a lack of technicality.
   - While not quantitatively given, let us denote this likelihood as \(P(B|A) = x\).

4. **Likelihood of the Description given Jason is a Humanities Professor (\(P(B|A^c)\)):**
   - The description seems more typical of humanities professors given the traits listed.
   - We need to denote this likelihood as \(P(B|A^c) = y\).

Since we lack specific numerical values for the likelihoods \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A^c)\) and because the humanities description fits more intuitively, we can reasonably assume:

\[ y > x \]
 
Assuming \(P(B|A) = 0.2\) and \(P(B|A^c) = 0.8\), as an example (subjective but reasonable estimate):

5. **Total Probability of Description (\(P(B)\)):**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

6. **Posterior Probability (\(P(A|B)\)):**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description is approximately:
