Given the description, we need to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given data.

We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, let's define the probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total, so \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors and 100 professors in total, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have the exact likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)), we must estimate them based on the provided information. Given the description of Jason—creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical—it seems more likely to fit a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (It is less likely given a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.9 \) (It is more likely given a humanities professor)

Now, we can use these values to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
