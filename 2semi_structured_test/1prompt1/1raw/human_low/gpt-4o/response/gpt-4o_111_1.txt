To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let's define the following probabilities:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a computer science professor.
2. \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen description is of a humanities professor.
3. \( P(Desc|CS) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(Desc|Hum) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(Desc) \): The overall probability of the given description.

We are asked to find \( P(CS|Desc) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

For the sake of Bayes' theorem, we also need estimates of \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|Hum) \), but since we don't have detailed data on these, we will translate the qualitative description into likely values. 

Given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring... gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical"), it seems more consistent with the traits usually associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. Hence, we can infer the following approximate likelihoods:

- \( P(Desc|CS) = 0.1 \) (a guess based on the description being less typical for CS)
- \( P(Desc|Hum) = 0.9 \) (a guess based on the description being more typical for humanities)

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} \]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.036.

Here is the answer in the required format:
