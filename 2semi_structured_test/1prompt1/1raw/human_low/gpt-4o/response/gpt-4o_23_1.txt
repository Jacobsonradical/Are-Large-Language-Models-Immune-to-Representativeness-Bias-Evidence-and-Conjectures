To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in its basic form states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description among computer science professors.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \( A_1 \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_2 \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description of Jason.

We have been given:
- There are 25 computer science professors \( P(A_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors \( P(A_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We assume no biases in details between the fields without external information \( P(D|A_1) \) and \( P(D|A_2) \)

By Linda problem's stereotype content, Jason's description fits more with a humanities professor, so
\( P(D|A_1) \approx 0.2 \)
\( P(D|A_2) \approx 0.8 \)

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(D|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1|D) = \frac{P(D|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} =  \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately: {"probability": "0.077"}
