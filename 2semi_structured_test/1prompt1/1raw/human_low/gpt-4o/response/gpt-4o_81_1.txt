To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Base rates (prior probabilities)**:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): 25 out of 100 professors, so:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): 75 out of 100 professors, so:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods**: These are the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Since we don't have exact numbers, we must consider the traits described:
   - Jason is emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, and not particularly technical. These traits are more commonly associated with the humanities.

   We assign a probability of:
   - Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)): Let's assume this is relatively low given his non-technical description, say 0.2.
   - Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)): Let's assume this is higher given the match with creativity and imagination, say 0.8.

3. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason's description:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(D) = 0.2 \times 0.25 + 0.8 \times 0.75 = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

   Now, calculating the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.0769 or rounded to 0.077.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{"probability": "0.077"}
```
