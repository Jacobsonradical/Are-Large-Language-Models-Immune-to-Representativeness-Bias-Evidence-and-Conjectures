To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful here because we have prior probabilities and need to update these with the given information.

First, we need to determine a few probabilities.

Let's start with the prior probabilities:

1. Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the study is a computer science professor (\(P(\text{CS})\)).
2. Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the study is a humanities professor (\(P(\text{Hum})\)).

Given:
- 25 professors from computer science
- 75 professors from the humanities

The total number of professors: \(25 + 75 = 100\)

So,
\(P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

\(P(\text{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need the likelihoods. This is where things become more subjective without additional empirical data. We need to estimate:

- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS})\): The probability of getting this description if Jason is a CS professor.
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum})\): The probability of getting this description if Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven...not particularly technical," it seems more consistent with humanities than computer science. So, let's assume reasonable subjective likelihoods:

- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1\) (since this description seems less likely for a CS professor)
- \(P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) = 0.9\) (since this description seems more likely for someone in humanities)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
