To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the description given.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to determine each of these components:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor \( P(C) \)**:
\[ P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor \( P(H) \)**:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood of the description given the professor is from computer science \( P(D|C) \)** and from humanities \( P(D|H) \)**:

Given the description, traits such as "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical" are more commonly associated with humanities than with computer science. While we might not have exact probabilities, we'll denote:
\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.1 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \]

Lastly, **Total probability \( P(D) \)**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
