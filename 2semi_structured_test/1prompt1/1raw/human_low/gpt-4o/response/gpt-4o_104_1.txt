First, we need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. This is a classic example of using Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

To compute this probability, we need to know:

1. The prior probability of picking a computer science professor (P(CS)).
2. The prior probability of picking a humanities professor (P(Hum)).
3. The probability of observing the description given that the person is a computer science professor (P(Desc | CS)).
4. The probability of observing the description given that the person is a humanities professor (P(Desc | Hum)).

### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of picking a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of picking a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description for both groups. Since the description suggests creativity, imagination, emotion-driven, etc., which are often more associated with humanities rather than technical fields, we might guess:
     - P(Desc | CS): Let's assume a lower probability, such as 0.1 (assuming these traits are less common in computer science professors).
     - P(Desc | Hum): Let's assume a higher probability, such as 0.9 (assuming these traits are more common in humanities professors).

3. **Posterior Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)}
   \]

   Simplifying the denominator:

   \[
   P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.
