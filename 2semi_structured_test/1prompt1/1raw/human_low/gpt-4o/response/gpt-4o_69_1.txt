To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS professors) in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Base Rates:**
   - Number of CS professors = 25
   - Number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total professors = 100

2. **Prior Probability (Base Rates):**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from CS = \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = \( P(\text{humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihood (How well the description fits the fields):**
   - In the absence of specific data on how likely the described traits fit professors in each field, let's assume that the description is equally likely to describe a humanities professor or a CS professor (which is generally not realistic but is the best assumption given the lack of further specifics).

   Therefore:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{humanities}) \)

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since the description is equally likely given either discipline:
   \[
   P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{humanities})
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{humanities})}
   \]

   Given the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Given the information and assuming equal likelihood:
