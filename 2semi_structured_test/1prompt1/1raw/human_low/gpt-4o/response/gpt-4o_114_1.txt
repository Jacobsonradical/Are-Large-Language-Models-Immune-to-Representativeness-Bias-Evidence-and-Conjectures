To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that he is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayesâ€™ Theorem formula is:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's break these down:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Probability of the description \( D \):**
   - We need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), and then use these to find \( P(D) \).

Given the description of Jason, it seems more aligned with traits commonly found in the humanities professors than in computer science professors. We will assign reasonable likelihood estimates based on these traits.

- Assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \): This is the probability a computer science professor matches this description.
- Assume \( P(D | H) = 0.6 \): This is the probability a humanities professor matches this description.

3. **Total probability of the description \( D \):**
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.6 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.475 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0526 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0526.

Therefore, the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.0526"}
