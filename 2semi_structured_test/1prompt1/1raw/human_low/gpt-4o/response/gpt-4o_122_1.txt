To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we would use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to estimate how likely a professor matching Jason's description would be from computer science versus the humanities. Based on common stereotypes or general knowledge, humanities professors are often described as creative, imaginative, and less technical. 

Thus, it might be reasonable to estimate:
   - Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description: \( P(Description|CS) = 0.1 \) (for estimation purposes, considering technical fields like CS might less frequently have such descriptions).
   - Probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description: \( P(Description|H) = 0.9 \) (as such descriptions might be more common in the humanities).

3. **Posterior Probability** (Using Bayes' Theorem):

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
\]

\[
P(H|Description) = \frac{P(Description|H) \times P(H)}{P(Description)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(Description) \):

\[
P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|H) \times P(H)
\]

\[
P(Description) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)
\]

\[
P(Description) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
\]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.0357
\]

Therefore,

\[
P(H|Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.036"
\]
