Sure, let's break down the information given and apply some basic probability concepts to compute the required probability.

Firstly, we know that:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We want to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description. 

Since we have no prior information that distinguishes the likelihood of a computer science professor's description versus a humanities professor's description outside of the numbers provided, we will assume that all descriptions are equally likely among the groups of professors.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability \( P(CS|D) \) that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \) is:
\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are the likelihoods of the description for each group; assuming the description is equally probable across both groups, these terms cancel out.

Thus:
\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Finally, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is:
\[ 
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
