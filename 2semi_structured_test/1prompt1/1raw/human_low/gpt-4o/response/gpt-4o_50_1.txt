To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and the given evidence.

Here's the structure of Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting a professor with a description like Jason's.

First, we need to establish these probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The probability that a professor is a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors. 
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that a professor is in the humanities is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to make assumptions about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), which are the probabilities of getting Jason's description if he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. Given the description's nature (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with humanities professors, but let's assume values reflect a higher likelihood for humanities:
- Assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.10 \) (description fits less with a computer science professor)
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.40 \) (description fits more with a humanities professor)

Now we need to compute \( P(B) \), which can be determined using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.10 \cdot 0.25) + (0.40 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.30 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
