We can approach this problem using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

So the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(A)_{\text{CS}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A)_{\text{Hum}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A) \) given that Jason is a humanities professor. Because the description emphasizes creativity, imagination, and non-technical aspects, we might reasonably consider it more likely to describe a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. 

Let's assume the description of Jason is 10 times more likely to describe a humanities professor than a computer science professor. We set:
\[ P(B| \text{Hum})_{\text{prof}} = 10 \times P(B| \text{CS})_{\text{prof}} \]

Given that \( P(B) \) is the same for both groups, we change the question to assessing the relative likelihoods.

Now, we calculate:
\[ P(\text{hum}) = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(B|\text{CS}) = x \]
\[ P(B|\text{Hum}) = 10x \]

Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[
P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x \cdot 0.25 + 10x \cdot 0.75}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 7.5}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.25}{7.75}
\]
\[
P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.032
\]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.032.
