To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states: 
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

Let's define the components:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Given there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, this is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. This is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B | A) \): The probability of Jason fitting the description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | \neg A) \): The probability of Jason fitting the description if he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of fitting the description.

We need to estimate \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \). Given the description "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical", it seems more aligned with the traits of humanities professors rather than computer science professors.

Let's assume the following plausible estimates based on the description:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.1 \): It's less likely for a computer science professor to fit this description.
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.4 \): More likely for a humanities professor to fit this description.

Now, let's calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.077 (rounded to three decimal places).

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.077"}
