To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event given some evidence to the probabilities of the evidence given the event and the prior probabilities of the event.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( P(CS|D) \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors.
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Description Probabilities \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
   - Based on Jason's description of being creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it seems more likely that he fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.
   - Let’s assume \( P(D|CS) \) is low, say 0.1, since his profile is not typical for a CS professor.
   - Let’s assume \( P(D|H) \) is higher, say 0.8, since this profile fits better with a humanities professor.

4. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   - The total probability of the description \( P(D) \) is given by considering both groups:
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 = 0.625 \)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
