To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

Here's how we can compute this:

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
   \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(H) \):
   \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \), and given he is a humanities professor, \( P(D|H) \).

3. **Evidence**: The probability of Jason's description overall, \( P(D) \):

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]

   However, we don’t have the exact values for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). In the absence of specific data, we can make a considered assumption based on the description. Jason’s description fits more traditionally with traits associated with someone in humanities than in computer science.

   For a rough estimate, we might use something like:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.1
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.9
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, \( P(CS|D) \):

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Substituting into Bayes' formula:

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.7
   \]

   Now, compute \( P(CS|D) \):

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} 
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} 
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = 0.0357
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.036"}
\]
