To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the relevant events:
- \(A_{\text{CS}}\): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \(A_{\text{Hum}}\): Jason is one of the humanities professors.

We need to find \(P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:

\[ P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \(P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}})\): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A_{\text{CS}})\): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{description})\): Total probability of the description.

Let's break these down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - So, \(P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   - And \(P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \(P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}})\): The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(\text{description} | A_{\text{Hum}})\): The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Since Jason has traits that are more aligned with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical), let's assume:
   - \(P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.1\)
   - \(P(\text{description} | A_{\text{Hum}}) = 0.9\)

3. **Total Probability:**
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(\text{description} | A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
   \[ P(\text{description}) = 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \]
   \[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}} | \text{description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.036"} \]
