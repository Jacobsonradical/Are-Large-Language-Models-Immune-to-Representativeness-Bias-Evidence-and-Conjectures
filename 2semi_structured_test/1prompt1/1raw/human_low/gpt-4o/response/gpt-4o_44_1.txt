To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \): Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's calculate each of these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100.
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100.
   - Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Thus, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \)**:
   - The description of Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor better than that of a computer science professor (due to terms like "creative and imaginative," "emotionally driven," "not particularly technical").
   - Suppose we estimate that only 10% of computer science professors fit Jason's description, i.e., \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \).
   - Suppose we estimate that 50% of humanities professors fit Jason's description, i.e., \( P(D|H) = 0.5 \).

3. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.5 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.375 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.4 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.4} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.0625 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0625.

Thus, the answer is:
