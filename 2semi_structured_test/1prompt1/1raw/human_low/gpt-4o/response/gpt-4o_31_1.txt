To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know the following:
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is 25/100 = 0.25.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is 75/100 = 0.75.

Letâ€™s assume we don't have specific data about how likely it is for someone with Jason's personality description to be in either field (computer science or humanities). In such a case, we assume that the likelihood of a given description being written for a professor in either field is equally probable. Thus:
- \( P(\text{Description} | C) \) is the likelihood of getting Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) is the likelihood of getting Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

If we assume these likelihoods to be equal or not substantially different, \( P(\text{Description} | C) \approx P(\text{Description} | H) \), they cancel out in the calculation of posterior probabilities:

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(H | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both:

\[ P(C | \text{Description}) \propto P(C) \]

\[ P(H | \text{Description}) \propto P(H) \]

Because \( P(C) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75 \):

So, the normalized probabilities will be:

\[  P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25  \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
