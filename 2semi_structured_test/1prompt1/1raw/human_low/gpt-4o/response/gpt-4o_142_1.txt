First, let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. We are given some characteristics of Jason and want to determine the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.

Let's define:
- \( C_s \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to compute:
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) \]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | C_s) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C_s) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the priors:
\[ P(C_s) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's consider:
\[ P(\text{description} | C_s) \] and \[ P(\text{description} | H) \]

Given the description, it seems more characteristic of humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical). For simplicity and without specific likelihood values, let's assume:
\[ P(\text{description} | C_s) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{description} | H) = 0.9 \]

Now, compute the evidence term:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C_s) \cdot P(C_s) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Finally, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C_s | \text{description}) = \frac{1}{28} \approx 0.036 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
```json
{"probability": "0.036"}
