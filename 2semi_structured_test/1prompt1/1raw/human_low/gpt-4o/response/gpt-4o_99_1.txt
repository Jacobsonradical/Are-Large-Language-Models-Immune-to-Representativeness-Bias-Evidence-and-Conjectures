To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events.

Let's define the terms:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a professor is from the computer science department.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a professor is from the humanities department.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability that the description matches Jason if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability that the description matches Jason if he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability that a professor matches the description of Jason.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the probabilities of a randomly chosen professor being from CS or H are:
  
  \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  
  \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is from the computer science department given the description:
  
Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Since the description of Jason suggests he is not particularly technical and is more creative and imaginative, emotionally driven, etc., it seems less likely that he fits the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. However, without specific values, we'll make educated assumptions.

Let's assume that the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor (non-technical traits) is \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \) and for a humanities professor (creative and imaginative traits) is \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \).

Plugging in these numbers:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{28} \]

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
