To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the following terms:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given for Jason.

We aim to find \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate the following probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): the total probability of the description.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

So, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To simplify the problem, assume the description matches the typical traits of humanities professors more strongly than computer science professors. Let's assume (hypothetically) that:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10% probability the description matches a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.4 \) (i.e., 40% probability the description matches a humanities professor).

Now, we need to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.325 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.077 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
