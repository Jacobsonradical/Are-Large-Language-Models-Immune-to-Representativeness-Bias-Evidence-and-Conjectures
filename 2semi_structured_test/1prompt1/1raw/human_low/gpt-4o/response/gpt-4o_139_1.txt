To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the probability of the description overall.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- There are 75 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given the description, it seems more aligned with a humanities professor than a computer science professor. We might assume:
- The probability that a random computer science professor matches Jason's description is relatively low. Let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.1 \).
- The probability that a random humanities professor matches Jason's description is relatively high. Let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \).

Now, applying these values to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.6} = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} = 0.04 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
