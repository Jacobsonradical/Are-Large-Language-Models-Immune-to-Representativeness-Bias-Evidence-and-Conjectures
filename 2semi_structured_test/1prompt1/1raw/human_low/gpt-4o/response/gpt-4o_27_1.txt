Certainly! We can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. Let's denote:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

Given data:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(CS) \)) = 25 out of 100.
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(H) \)) = 75 out of 100.
- We assume that \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability that a computer science professor fits the description \( D \).
- We assume that \( P(D|H) \) is the probability that a humanities professor fits the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equally likely due to lack of specific information regarding the description fitting one group more than the other, we can simplify:

Let \( P(D|CS) = x \) and \( P(D|H) = y \). Based on symmetry, assume \( x = y \).

Now:

\[ P(D) = x \cdot \frac{25}{100} + x \cdot \frac{75}{100} = x \cdot 1 = x \]

Thus:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{x \cdot \frac{25}{100}}{x} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
