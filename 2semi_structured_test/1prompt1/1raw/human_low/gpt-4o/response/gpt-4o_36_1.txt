To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   Here, we need to consider the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   - \( P(D|CS) \): Probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): Probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

Given that Jason's description includes traits that are more aligned with those of a humanities professor (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring, not particularly technical), it's reasonable to assume that \( P(D|H) \) > \( P(D|CS) \).

For the sake of calculation, let's assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \).

3. **Posterior probability:**
   Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   where

   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Let's plug in the numbers:

   \[
   P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

   Now,

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.
