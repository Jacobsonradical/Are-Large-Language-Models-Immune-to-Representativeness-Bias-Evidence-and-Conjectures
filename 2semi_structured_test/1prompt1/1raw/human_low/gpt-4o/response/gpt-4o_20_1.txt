To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. We start with the prior probabilities and then update them based on the information provided.

First, recall the numbers in the study:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75

**Prior probabilities:**
- Probability that Jason is a CS professor, P(CS): 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, P(H): 75/100 = 0.75

Next, we need to consider how likely it is for Jason's description to fit a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Without specific data, we will assume the likelihood of Jason's description fitting each type of professor based on the description given. 

The description of Jason talks about creativity, imagination, emotional drive, passion, and non-technical attributes, which might be more likely to be found in humanities professors than in computer science professors. But to proceed mathematically, I'll assign hypothetical likelihoods based on the given traits:

**Likelihoods:**
- Probability of Jason's description if he is a CS professor, P(description | CS): Let's assume 0.2 (since his traits don't fit the typical technical profile of a CS professor).
- Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor, P(description | H): Let's assume 0.8 (since his traits are more aligned with humanities).

**Bayes' theorem formula:**
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

First, calculate the total probability of the description appearing, P(description):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.0769 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, is approximately 0.0769.
