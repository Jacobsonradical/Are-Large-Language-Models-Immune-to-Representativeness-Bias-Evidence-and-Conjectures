To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define our events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description given.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 tenured computer science professors and 75 tenured humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- And \( P(A^c) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \) (Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.)

Given the description of Jason ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, not particularly technical"), intuitively it seems more likely to match a humanities professor's profile than a computer science professor's.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \) (We assume that computer science professors are less likely to match this profile).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.3 \) (We assume that humanities professors are more likely to match this profile).

We then use the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.1 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \(0.1\).
