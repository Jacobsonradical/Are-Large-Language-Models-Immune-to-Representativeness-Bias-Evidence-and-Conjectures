To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probability with likelihood to form a posterior probability. Let's define the terms:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS \mid D) \): The posterior probability we want to find, which is the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's calculate the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we need to assess the likelihoods, \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Based on Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with typical humanities faculties rather than computer science. 

Let's assume hypothetically:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.2 \) (because these traits are less common in computer science)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.8 \) (because these traits are more common in the humanities)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

Now, calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \):
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.

Final answer:
