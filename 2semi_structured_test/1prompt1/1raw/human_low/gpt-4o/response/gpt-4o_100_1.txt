To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Base Rate (Prior Probability):**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let's denote the observation (description fitting Jason) as \( D \).
   - We need \( P(D | CS) \), the probability of observing the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - We also need \( P(D | Hum) \), the probability of observing the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given that the description leans toward non-technical traits, it is more likely to fit a humanities professor. For the sake of this problem, letâ€™s hypothesize:
   - \( P(D | CS) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(D | Hum) = 0.9 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing the description \( D \). This can be computed as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Now, calculating \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
