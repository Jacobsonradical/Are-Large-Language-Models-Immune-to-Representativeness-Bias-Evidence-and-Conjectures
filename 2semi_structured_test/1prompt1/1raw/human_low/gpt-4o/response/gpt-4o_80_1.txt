To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's assign our specific values:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event of the given description.

Here, \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Similarly, \( P(\neg A) \), the probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

While we do not know the exact values of \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), we can make a reasonable assumption based on the description. The description of Jason as "creative," "imaginative," "emotionally driven," and "not particularly technical" seems more likely to fit a humanities professor than a computer science professor.

Let's make an educated estimate:
- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.1 \), a relatively lower probability.
- Assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.4 \), a relatively higher probability given the description.

Now, we compute \( P(B) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.4 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.3 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.0769 \]

So, the estimated probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769 (or around 7.69%).

Here is the probability in the specified format:
