To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem combines prior probabilities (base rates) with likelihoods to compute posterior probabilities (updated probabilities based on new information).

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Computer Science Professors (CS): 25 out of 100, so \( P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \)
   - Humanities Professors (HU): 75 out of 100, so \( P(\text{HU}) = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   Examining the description of Jason, he is described as "creative, imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical."

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
   - \( P(D|\text{HU}) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is in the humanities.

   Based on the provided description, Jason appears to have qualities more aligned with humanities than computer science (since he is "not particularly technical"). Therefore, we can assign approximate likelihood values reflecting this intuition (specific exact values would ideally come from empirical data, and here we use informed estimation):
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(D|\text{HU}) = 0.8 \)

   These likelihoods represent our informed judgement of how likely a person with Jason's description comes from each group.

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups:

\[ P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{HU}) \cdot P(\text{HU}) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Now calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|D) = 0.04 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.04.
