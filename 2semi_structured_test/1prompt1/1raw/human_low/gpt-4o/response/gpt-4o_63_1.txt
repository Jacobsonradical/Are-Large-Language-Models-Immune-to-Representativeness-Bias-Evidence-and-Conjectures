To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. 

Given:
- Total number of professors: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75

We need to find \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \). Here, \(\text{CS}\) denotes that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(\text{Description}\) denotes the given personality description.

Bayes' theorem can be stated as:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Let's break this down:

1. **\( P(\text{CS}) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **\( P(\text{Humanities}) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider how likely the given description is if Jason is a computer science professor vs. if he is a humanities professor.

3. **\( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. **\( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)**: The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description seems to be more aligned with traits typically associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we can reasonably assume that:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \gg P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \]

For calculation purposes, letâ€™s assign:
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.9 \]

5. **\( P(\text{Description}) \)**: The total probability of the description. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, putting it all together:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357. In the requested format:
