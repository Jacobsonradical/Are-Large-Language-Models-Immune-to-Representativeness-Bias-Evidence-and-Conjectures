To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant quantities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(HUM) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The likelihood of the description \( D \) given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|HUM) \): The likelihood of the description \( D \) given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(CS|D) \): The posterior probability that the professor is from computer science given the description \( D \).

We know the following from the problem setup:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the priors are:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \quad \text{and} \quad P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \) and can be computed as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)
\]

Since the actual values of \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|HUM) \) are not given directly in the problem, we will assume these descriptions are equally likely across both groups for simplicity or based on the provided description that seems more humanities-aligned. Practically, one might deduce \( P(D|CS) \) being lower if it's not a common personality in the field of CS, but without particular distributions, assumptions can be made.

If we reasonably assume:
\[
P(D|CS) = 0.1 \quad \text{(based on not a very technical passion)}
\]
\[
P(D|HUM) = 0.9  \quad \text{(more aligned with humanities)}
\]

With these assumptions:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \\
= 0.1 \times 0.25 + 0.9 \times 0.75 \\
= 0.025 + 0.675 \\
= 0.7
\]

Using Bayes’ theorem’s calculation:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.
