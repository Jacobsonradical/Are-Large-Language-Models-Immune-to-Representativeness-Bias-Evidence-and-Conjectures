To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's denote the following:
- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) : The description provided.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We also have:
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since Jason must be either a computer science or a humanities professor,
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- The base rate or prior probability for being a computer science professor \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The base rate or prior probability for being a humanities professor \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The description is more indicative of typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than computer science professors. However, we don't have the exact likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). For simplicity, we assume that the description is more likely among humanities professors:

Let's approximate:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \) (assumed probability the description fits a computer science professor, as these traits don't strongly align with technical backgrounds).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (assumed probability the description fits a humanities professor, as the traits like being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven fit well).

Now, we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.036.
Here's the answer in the required format:
