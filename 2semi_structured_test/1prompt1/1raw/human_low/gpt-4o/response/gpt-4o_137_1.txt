To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the evidence provided by Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's break down these components:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so:
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability:**
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we do not have specific information about the exact distribution of descriptions among computer science and humanities professors, we make an assumption based on typical characteristics described. Given the description, we assume Jason is more likely to fit the profile of a humanities professor.

For the sake of example, let's assume:
   - \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \) (this is hypothetical based on the description being less typical for a technical field)
   - \( P(D|H) = 0.9 \) (this is hypothetical based on the description being more typical for the humanities field)

4. **Total Probability:**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.7
   \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(C|D) \approx 0.0357
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.036 \).
