To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability of picking a computer science professor without any description is \( P(CS) \).
2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
3. **Marginal Probability**: The overall probability of getting a professor with this description, \( P(D) \).
4. **Posterior Probability (What we want)**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, \( P(CS|D) \).

The priors are simple:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since there is no specific information about the likelihoods we have to make educated assumptions:
- Assume \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) based on common sense. Given Jason's traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, gifted, passionate, not technical), it seems more aligned with humanities than with computer science.

Intuitively, let's say:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is relatively low because Jason's traits are not typical for a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.2 \) (this is an assumption - adjust as needed).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (this is an assumption - adjust as needed).

Now, the total probability \( P(D) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we compute the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1}{13} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability is:
