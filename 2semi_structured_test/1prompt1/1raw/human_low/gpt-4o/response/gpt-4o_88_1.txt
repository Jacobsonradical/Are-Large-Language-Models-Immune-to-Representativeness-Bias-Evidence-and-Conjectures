To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The basic idea is to compute the conditional probability based on the provided information. 

Here are the given data:
- The total number of professors interviewed is 100 (25 computer science + 75 humanities).
- We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on his description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) : Description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. 

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of Jason's description overall.

Let's assume a reasonable scenario where the probability of Jason's description given he is from either field is the same, due to no specific information about the difference in descriptions. Under this scenario:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

Thus, the calculation simplifies since only the prior probabilities influence the result. We can use the ratio of the number of professors in each group:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same in the numerator and denominator and cancels out:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Final probability:
{"probability": "0.25"}
