To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down step-by-step with the information provided.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \): 
     \[
     P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability of being a humanities professor, \( P(\text{H}) \): 
     \[
     P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \), and a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \).

   Given the description, Jason is described as non-technical, creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, which might be less typical of a computer science professor and more typical of a humanities professor. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.3 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - Using Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - To find \( P(\text{Description}) \):
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.225 = 0.25
     \]
   - Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.025}{0.25} = 0.1
     \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.1.
