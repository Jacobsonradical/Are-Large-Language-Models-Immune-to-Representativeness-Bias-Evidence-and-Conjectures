To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we approach the problem:

Let \( H_{cs} \) be the hypothesis that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H_{hu} \) be the hypothesis that Jason is a humanities professor. We want to find \( P(H_{cs} \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{cs} \mid D) = \frac{ P(D \mid H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) }{ P(D) } \]

We can break this down step by step:

1. **Prior probabilities**: The probabilities of Jason being from each type of professor.
   \[ P(H_{cs}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H_{hu}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods**: The probabilities of the description given the type of professor. Let's denote:
   \[ P(D \mid H_{cs}) \]
   \[ P(D \mid H_{hu}) \]

   For this problem, we need to make reasonable estimates of these likelihoods based on the description provided. Given that Jason is described as "not particularly technical," "creative," "imaginative," and "emotionally driven," it is more likely that Jason fits the profile of a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor.

   Assuming \( P(D \mid H_{cs}) \) is significantly lower than \( P(D \mid H_{hu}) \), let's assign some plausible values:
   \[ P(D \mid H_{cs}) = 0.1 \]
   \[ P(D \mid H_{hu}) = 0.9 \]

3. **Total probability of the description** \( P(D) \):
   \[ P(D) = P(D \mid H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(D \mid H_{hu}) \cdot P(H_{hu}) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' theorem**:
   \[ P(H_{cs} \mid D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs} \mid D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(H_{cs} \mid D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.

So the answer to the question can be formatted as:
```
{"probability": "0.0357"}
