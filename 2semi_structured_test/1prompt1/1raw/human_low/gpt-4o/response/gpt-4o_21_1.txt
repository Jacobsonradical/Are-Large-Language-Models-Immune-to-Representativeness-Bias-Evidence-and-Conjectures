To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given for Jason.

We want to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description \( D \) occurring.

Firstly, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description \( D \) is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors (which is a simplifying assumption in the absence of more specific information), we have:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]

So:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 = P(D|C) \]

Thus, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|C)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
