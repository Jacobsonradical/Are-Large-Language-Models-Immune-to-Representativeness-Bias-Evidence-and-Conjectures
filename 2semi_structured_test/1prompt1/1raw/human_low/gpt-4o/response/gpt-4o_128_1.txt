To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description matches Jason's personality.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(HU) \) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, we need to evaluate \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|HU) \), the probabilities of getting Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Since Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and not particularly technical, it is more likely that this description matches a humanities professor rather than a computer science professor. Let's assume:
- \( P(Desc|CS) = 0.1 \)
- \( P(Desc|HU) = 0.9 \)

Now, we need to calculate \( P(Desc) \):
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]

\[ P(Desc) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(Desc) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]

\[ P(Desc) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we find \( P(CS|Desc) \):

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|Desc) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0357.

Here is the formatted answer: {"probability": "0.0357"}
