To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given this description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Define the given probabilities:**
   - Probability of choosing a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of choosing a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Estimate the likelihood of the description for each group:**
   - Let's denote the description characteristics that match Jason as \( D \).
   - Probability of a computer science professor having this description: \( P(D|CS) \)
   - Probability of a humanities professor having this description: \( P(D|H) \)

Given the description, traits like creativity, imagination, emotional drive, passion, and lack of technical inclination are likely more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. Therefore:
   - We can reasonably estimate \( P(D|CS) \) to be lower, for example, around 0.1.
   - And \( P(D|H) \) to be higher, for example, around 0.4.

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):**
   - Bayes' theorem formula is:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - The total probability \( P(D) \) can be calculated by:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
     \[
     P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.4 \cdot 0.75 = 0.025 + 0.3 = 0.325
     \]

4. **Calculate \( P(CS|D) \):**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} = \frac{0.025}{0.325} = \frac{25}{325} = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0769.

Therefore, the answer should be:
```json
{"probability": "0.0769"}
