To solve this, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's outline the known information:

1. There are 100 professors in total.
2. Out of these, 25 are in computer science, and 75 are in the humanities.
3. The trait description is claimed without specific group association probability.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason has the given description.

We need to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's what we need to determine for this calculation:

- \( P(A) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
  \[
  P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of Jason fitting the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability of Jason fitting the description given that he is a humanities professor.

Without actual probabilities for the specific descriptions, we can proceed with the simplifying assumption that the description is equally likely to describe either group because we don't have additional specifics indicating otherwise.

If we assume the description is equally likely to describe a computer science professor or a humanities professor, then \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are equal. Let's denote this common value as \( P(B|A) \):

If the description is equally likely to occur for either group:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Additionally, since Jason has no particular characteristic leaning him more towards one group based on this generalized description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given equal likelihood:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(\neg A) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) \]

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(B|A) \cdot 1 = P(B|A) \]

Still, proceeding with Bayes and given the equal probability of description defining both groups:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, based on the provided info, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
