To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- The description appears equally likely to describe a professor from either group if we have no other information.

Let:
- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc|CS) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc|H) \) be the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \) be the probability of the description in general.

We need to calculate \( P(CS|Desc) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

From the given data:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Suppose \( P(Desc|CS) \) and \( P(Desc|H) \) are how likely Jason fits the description if he's in one group or the other. Because the description includes traits such as creativity, imagination, and being emotionally driven (traits less stereotypically associated with computer science and more with humanities), it might be more probable that Jason is a humanities professor. However, without exact numbers for these probabilities and for simplicity, we assume:

- \( P(Desc|CS) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(Desc|H) \approx 0.8 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

To find \( P(Desc) \):

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc|H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.625 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|Desc) = 0.04 \]
