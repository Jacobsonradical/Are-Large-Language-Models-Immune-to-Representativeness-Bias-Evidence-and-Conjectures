To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided (Jason is a creative and imaginative person, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical).

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. Compute the prior probabilities:

\[
P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[
P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

2. Assess \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given the description of Jason, it seems more tailored to humanities traits rather than computer science traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical). We'll assume a rough distribution personally. Let's assume:

\[
P(D|C) = 0.20 \quad \text{(low due to less likely fit)}
\]

\[
P(D|H) = 0.70 \quad \text{(higher due to more likely fit)}
\]

3. Compute the total probability of the description, \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
P(D) = (0.20 \cdot 0.25) + (0.70 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.525 = 0.575
\]

4. Apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.25}{0.575} = \frac{0.05}{0.575} \approx 0.08696
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.087"}}
\]
