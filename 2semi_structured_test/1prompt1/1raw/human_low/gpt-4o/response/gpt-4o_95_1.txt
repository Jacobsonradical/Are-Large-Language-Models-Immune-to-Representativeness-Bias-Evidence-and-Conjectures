To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we must apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new information.

In this scenario:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We are trying to calculate the probability \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the likelihoods of the description given Jason is a computer science or humanities professor. However, these likelihoods aren't directly provided in the problem, so one approach is to use the base rate probabilities directly. In real scenarios, estimating these likelihoods might need empirical data or expert knowledge.

Assuming no additional information that distinguishes descriptions for likelihood:
- We simplify by recognizing that all descriptions are randomly assigned based on the proportion of subjects in each category.

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Under the assumption \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Since the likelihoods cancel out, we can simplify directly to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
