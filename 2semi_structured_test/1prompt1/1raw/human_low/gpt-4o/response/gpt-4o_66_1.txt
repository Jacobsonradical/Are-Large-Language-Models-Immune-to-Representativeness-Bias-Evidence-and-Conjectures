To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since the description is given at random, let's compute \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

The total number of professors is 100, with 25 in computer science and 75 in humanities.
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to consider \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description, it's more indicative of a humanities professor (emotionally driven, creative, imaginative, not particularly technical) than of a computer science professor. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that:
\[ P(D|C) << P(D|H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.2 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) as rough estimates.

Finally, we can use the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.0769.
