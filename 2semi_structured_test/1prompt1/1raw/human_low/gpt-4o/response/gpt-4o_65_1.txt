To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we have some initial information:

- There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors.
- There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given the description of Jason, which matches some personality traits. To use Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate:
- \( P(C) \) - The prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) - The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given Jason's description, we also need to consider:
- \( P(D | C) \) - The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) - The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are computing \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description. We can express \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

For simplification, let's assume that Jason's creative and non-technical traits are more likely to be associated with humanities professors. Therefore, without specific values for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) \) is relatively low.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively high.

Given an approximate yet reasonable assumption for these values:
- \( P(D | C) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood for a computer science professor to fit this description)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood for a humanities professor to fit this description)

Now plug the values into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the final probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
