To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided matches Jason.

We are required to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each term:

1. \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the description matches a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): Overall probability that the description matches any professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 100.

Thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \). 

Given that the description provided is more consistent with traits commonly associated with humanities professors (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, exploratory, non-technical), it is reasonable to assume that \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of a computer science professor fitting this description) is low compared to \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability of a humanities professor fitting this description).

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (a conservative guess given the description)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.8 \)

Now we compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now inserting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.05) + (0.6) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately \( 0.0769 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ {"probability": "0.077"} \]
