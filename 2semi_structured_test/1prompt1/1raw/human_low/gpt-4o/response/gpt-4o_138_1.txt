To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probability of an event given another event to the marginal probabilities of each event.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \( D \) be the description given of Jason.

We want to compute \( P(A|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of Jason's description occurring, regardless of his field.

First, calculate the prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, calculate the prior probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, let's assume we have no specific reason to believe that creativity, imagination, and emotional drive are more likely associated with professors from either field without additional information. This means:
\[ P(D|A) \approx P(D|B) \]

Because \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \) occurring and can be written as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Since we assumed \( P(D|A) \approx P(D|B) \), we simplify \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|A) \cdot P(B) = P(D|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(B)) \]
\[ P(D) \approx P(D|A) \cdot 1 = P(D|A) \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D|A)} = P(A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|D) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
