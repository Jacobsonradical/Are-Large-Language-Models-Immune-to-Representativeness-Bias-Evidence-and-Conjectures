To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, we need to establish some key probabilities:

1. **P(CS | Jason)**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description.
2. **P(Jason | CS)**: The probability of Jason's description, given that he is a computer science professor.
3. **P(Jason | Humanities)**: The probability of Jason's description, given that he is a humanities professor.
4. **P(CS)**: The overall probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
5. **P(Humanities)**: The overall probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
6. **P(Jason)**: The overall probability of Jason's description happening regardless of the field.

We can assume the probabilities for CS and Humanities from the sample sizes:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Therefore:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Without specific information about \( P(Jason | CS) \) and \( P(Jason | Humanities) \), we'll need to consider the description and try to quantify these subjective probabilities. 

Given Jason's description—creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling and reading, and not particularly technical—it seems more likely to align with humanities rather than computer science. Thus we can infer:
- \( P(Jason | CS) \) might be relatively lower because the description emphasizes non-technical, creative, and imaginative traits.
- \( P(Jason | Humanities) \) might be relatively higher since the description fits well with common traits associated with humanities professors.

For simplicity and without additional specific data, we could estimate these probabilities with the following rough guesses:
- \( P(Jason | CS) \approx 0.1 \)
- \( P(Jason | Humanities) \approx 0.9 \)

Then, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]

Where \( P(Jason) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(Jason) = P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(Jason) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Jason) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(Jason) = 0.7 \]

Now, compute \( P(CS | Jason) \):

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Jason) \approx 0.0357 \]

This translates to approximately 0.036 (rounded to three decimal places).

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
