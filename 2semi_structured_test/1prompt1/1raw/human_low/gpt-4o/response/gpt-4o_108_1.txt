To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description fits Jason.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's determine each component:
- \(P(C)\), probability of a randomly chosen professor being from computer science:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \(P(H)\), probability of a randomly chosen professor being from humanities:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, we'll assume \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\) to be the likelihoods of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. Because Jason's description aligns more closely with typical traits of a humanities professor (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven), we'll assume:

- \(P(D|C)\) is relatively low:
Let's take \(P(D|C) = 0.1\) as an estimate.

- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively high:
Let's take \(P(D|H) = 0.9\) as an estimate.

Now we need \(P(D)\), the total probability of the description \(D\). By the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
