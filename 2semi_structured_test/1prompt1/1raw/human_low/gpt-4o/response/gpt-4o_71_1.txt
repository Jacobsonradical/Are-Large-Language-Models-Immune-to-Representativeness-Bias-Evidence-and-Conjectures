To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and can be formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{ P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

However, without specific information about the likelihoods \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|Humanities) \), we must make an educated guess based on Jason's description. From the description, Jason seems more inclined towards traits often associated with the humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven) rather than technical fields like computer science.

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|Humanities) \) is relatively high because Jason's traits align well with typical humanities traits. Let's assume \( P(B|Humanities) \approx 0.9 \) (hypothetically).
- \( P(B|CS) \) is relatively low because Jason's traits don't strongly align with typical computer science traits. Let's assume \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (hypothetically).

Now, we can compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(\text{CS}|B) \):

\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{ P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) }{ P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.7 } \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{ 0.025 }{ 0.7 } \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.036 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036 or 3.6%.

Thus, the answer is:
