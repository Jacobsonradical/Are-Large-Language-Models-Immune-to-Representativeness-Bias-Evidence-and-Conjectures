To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the events:

- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): The given description matches Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:

- \(P(A)\): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A^c)\): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the numbers provided:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor and a humanities professor, respectively.

Considering Jason's description, he is described as:
- Creative and imaginative,
- Emotionally driven,
- Enjoys traveling, reading, exploring,
- Gifted and passionate,
- Not particularly technical.

This description seems more characteristic of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, who might be expected to be more technical.

Let's make reasonable assumptions based on Jason's description:

- \( P(B|A) \): Probability of the description matching a computer science professor: It might be lower, say 0.10.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): Probability of the description matching a humanities professor: It might be higher, say 0.60.

Using these values, let's compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.10 \cdot 0.25) + (0.60 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.475 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.10 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0526 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.0526.
