To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This theorem takes into account the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence given different scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(Hum) \):
     \[
     P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**
   - Likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description given, \( P(Description | CS) \).
   - Likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description given, \( P(Description | Hum) \).

   Given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.), it seems more aligned with typical traits attributed to humanities professors. Let's hypothesize these likelihoods could reasonably be estimated as:
   - \( P(Description | CS) = 0.2 \): Assume 20% of CS professors fit this description.
   - \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.8 \): Assume 80% of humanities professors fit this description.

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**

   Bayes' theorem formula:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]

   Where \( P(Description) \) is the total probability of the description occurring:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum)
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(Description) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
   \]

4. **Calculating \( P(CS | Description) \)**:

   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.0769\).
