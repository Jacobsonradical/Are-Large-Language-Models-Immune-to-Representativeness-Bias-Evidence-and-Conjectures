To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to determine the likelihood of Jason's characteristics given the two groups of professors and then use the base rates from the study.

There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors and 75 tenured and successful humanities professors, giving us prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 25 / (25 + 75) = 25 / 100 = 0.25 (Probability of being a computer science professor)
- P(Humanities) = 75 / (25 + 75) = 75 / 100 = 0.75 (Probability of being a humanities professor)

Now, the description of Jason being more creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical, etc., seems to fit better with a humanities professor than with a computer science professor. However, we don’t have exact quantifications for these likelihoods in the problem statement, so we will assume some subjective probabilities to demonstrate the process.

Let's assume the likelihoods are:
- P(Jason's description | CS) = 0.1 
- P(Jason's description | Humanities) = 0.9 

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason's description) = \frac{P(Jason's description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason's description)} \]
\[ P(Humanities | Jason's description) = \frac{P(Jason's description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)}{P(Jason's description)} \]

We then calculate the total probability of observing Jason's description:
\[ P(Jason's description) = P(Jason's description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason's description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(Jason's description) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Jason's description) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason's description) = \frac{P(Jason's description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason's description)} \]
\[ P(CS | Jason's description) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Jason's description) \approx \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Jason's description) \approx 0.0357 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.0357"}
