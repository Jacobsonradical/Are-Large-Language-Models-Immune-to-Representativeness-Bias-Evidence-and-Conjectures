To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the given numbers and assumptions we'll work with:

- The number of computer science professors: \( n_{cs} = 25 \)
- The number of humanities professors: \( n_{hum} = 75 \)
- The total number of professors: \( n_{total} = n_{cs} + n_{hum} = 100 \)

Since we need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (CS) given his description, we denote:
- \( P(CS|D) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem formula in this context is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

However, since we have no specific reason to believe a particular likelihood for Jason's description given he is a computer science professor versus a humanities professor (based on the information provided), we will make use of the base rate (prior probabilities):
- Probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To proceed, we consider the uniformity or the neutral indication from the description and only the base rates without additional prior knowledge or likelihood differentiation, giving:

\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
