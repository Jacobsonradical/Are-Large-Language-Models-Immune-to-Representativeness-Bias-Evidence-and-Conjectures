To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the event given Jason's description.

We're interested in \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine these probabilities:

1. \( P(CS) \) - Prior probability of Jason being a CS professor
2. \( P(H) \) - Prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor
3. \( P(D|CS) \) - Probability of the description given a CS professor
4. \( P(D|H) \) - Probability of the description given a humanities professor

Because we are given no reason to believe the description favors one category over the other without additional context, we can assume \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) based on the sample sizes.

Given data:
- 25 CS professors
- 75 humanities professors

So:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To proceed, we'll call the relative likelihood that Jason's description fits CS professors as \( P(D|CS) = x \) and for humanities professors as \( P(D|H) = y \). If we assume these likelihoods are similar across the 100 descriptions, the ratio \( \frac{x}{y} \) should factor into the equation. For simplicity, assuming \( x \approx y \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = x \cdot 0.25 + y \cdot 0.75 \]

If \( x \approx y \):

\[ P(D) \approx x (\frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100}) = x \]

Now:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25 \]

Thus, considering no additional preference or bias in description fitting:

\[ \text{Probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximated at} \]
