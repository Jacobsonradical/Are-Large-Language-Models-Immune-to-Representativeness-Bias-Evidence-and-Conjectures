To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science (CS), \( P(CS) \):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the humanities (H), \( P(H) \):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Let \( E \) be the event that a professor has Jason's personality traits.
   - We need to estimate \( P(E|CS) \) and \( P(E|H) \), which are the probabilities that a CS professor or a humanities professor would exhibit Jason's described personality traits.
   - Given Jason's creativity, imagination, emotional drive, and lack of technicality, it might be reasonable to assume that such traits are more common among humanities professors than computer science professors. Let's estimate these probabilities as follows (the actual values would ideally come from domain-specific data or expert judgment):
     \[
     P(E|CS) \approx 0.2
     \]
     \[
     P(E|H) \approx 0.8
     \]

3. **Normalization constant:**
   - The total probability of the event \( E \) occurring, \( P(E) \):
     \[
     P(E) = P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75)
     \]
     \[
     P(E) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
     \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - The probability that Jason is a CS professor given his personality traits, \( P(CS|E) \):
     \[
     P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E)}
     \]
     \[
     P(CS|E) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65}
     \]
     \[
     P(CS|E) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
     \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
