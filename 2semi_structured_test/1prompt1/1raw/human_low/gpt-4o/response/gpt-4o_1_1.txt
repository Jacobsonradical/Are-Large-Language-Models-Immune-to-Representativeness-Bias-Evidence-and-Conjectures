To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this context, the hypothesis (\( H_{cs} \)) is that Jason is a computer science professor, and the evidence is his personality description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{P(E | H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs})}{P(E)} \]

- \( P(H_{cs}) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E | H_{cs}) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, the prior probability \( P(H_{cs}) \) is:

\[ P(H_{cs}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( H_{hum} \)) is:

\[ P(H_{hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To fully apply Bayes' theorem, we need to make an educated guess about the likelihoods \( P(E | H_{cs}) \) and \( P(E | H_{hum}) \). Based on Jason's description, he does not seem particularly technical, which might be less common among computer science professors but could be more common among humanities professors. 

For example, assume:
- \( P(E | H_{cs}) = 0.1 \) (unlikely, given his non-technical description)
- \( P(E | H_{hum}) = 0.3 \) (more likely, given his traits are characteristic of a creative humanities professor)

The overall probability \( P(E) \) is:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_{cs}) \cdot P(H_{cs}) + P(E | H_{hum}) \cdot P(H_{hum}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.3 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.25 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_{cs} | E) \):

\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(H_{cs} | E) = 0.1 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.1"}}
\]
