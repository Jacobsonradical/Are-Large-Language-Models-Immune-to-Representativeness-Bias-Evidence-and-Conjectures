To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here is the formula for Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason’s description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors \( \Rightarrow P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- There are 75 humanities professors \( \Rightarrow P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To apply Bayes' Theorem, assume we have no specific information about how many professors in each field match Jason's description, making it hard to define \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \) directly. Therefore, we reason with base rates and the given description's typical alignment with the field of humanities, typically characterized by less technical and more creative and imaginative individuals.

Since Jason's description fits the typical profile of humanities professors better, we can assume that:
\( P(B|A) \) for humanities professors is higher than for computer science professors.

But without exact numbers:
- \( P(B|humanities) \approx 0.9 \) (assumed high fit for humanities profiles).
- \( P(B|CS) \approx 0.1 \) (assumed low fit for CS profiles).

Now, we can rewrite Bayes' formula using the assumed values:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|humanities) \cdot P(humanities)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{(0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75)} \]

Calculating the denominator:

\[ 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \]
\[ 0.9 \cdot 0.75 = 0.675 \]

So:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.025 + 0.675} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
