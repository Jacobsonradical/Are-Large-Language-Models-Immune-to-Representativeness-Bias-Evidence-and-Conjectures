To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description fits Jason.

We aim to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need the following probabilities:

- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(D|C) \): The probability that the description fits a computer science professor. This is more subjective, but given the description of Jason (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), it is less likely to fit a stereotypical computer science professor. For the sake of this computation, let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.1 \]

- \( P(D|H) \): The probability that the description fits a humanities professor. Given the description of Jason, it is more likely to fit a stereotypical humanities professor. For the sake of this computation, let's assume:
\[ P(D|H) = 0.8 \]

- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description. This can be found by summing up the weighted probabilities of the description fitting both computer science and humanities professors:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.04 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.04"}
