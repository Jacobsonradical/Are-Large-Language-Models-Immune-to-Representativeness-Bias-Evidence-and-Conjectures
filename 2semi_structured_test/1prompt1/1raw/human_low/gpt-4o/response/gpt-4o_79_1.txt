To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. In this context, we need to find:

\[ P(CS | D) \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS).
- There are 75 humanities professors (HUM).
- The prior probability \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability \( P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To further proceed, we need subjective estimates:
- \( P(D | CS) \) — The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Let's suppose given the description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, etc.), a professional psychologist might intuitively estimate a low probability (e.g., 0.1) since these traits are less typical for a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | HUM) \) — The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor. This probability might be higher (e.g., 0.6) since these traits can be seen as more typical in humanities.

The overall probability of the description \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.6 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.45 = 0.475 \]

So, the Bayes' theorem formula becomes:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.0526.
