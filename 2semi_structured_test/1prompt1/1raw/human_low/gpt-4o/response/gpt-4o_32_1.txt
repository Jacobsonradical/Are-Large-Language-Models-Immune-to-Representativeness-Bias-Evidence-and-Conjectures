To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, we need to establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) : Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
- \( P(\text{Hum}) \) : Probability Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75

Next, we need to assess the probability of Jason's description given he is in each group. This can be subjective but crucial for solving the problem with available data:

- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \)

Since the probabilities of these descriptions can be challenging to estimate, and given no additional numerical data, let's assume Jason's description is more typical of a humanities professor due to his "creative, imaginative, emotionally driven" traits which are often more associated with the humanities. For instance, let's assume:

- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.1 \) (Assuming 10% probability his description fits a CS professor)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) = 0.3 \) (Assuming 30% probability his description fits a humanities professor)

Now we can find \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \cdot P(\text{Hum}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.3 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.225 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.25} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.1 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
