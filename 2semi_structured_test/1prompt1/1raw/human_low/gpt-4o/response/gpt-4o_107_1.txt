To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor from the given sample, we'll apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

First, let's define the relevant events:
- C: Jason is a computer science professor.
- H: Jason is a humanities professor.
- D: The description matches Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. With 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:
  \[
  P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. With 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. This might be difficult to assess exactly without more data. However, we can make an assumption based on the description that Jason's personality traits (creative, imaginative, not particularly technical) may be less common among computer science professors. Let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \).

- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description matches traits often found among humanities professors, let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.7 \).

- \( P(D) \) is the marginal probability of the description. It combines both probabilities weighted by their priors:
  \[
  P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
  \]
  \[
  = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.7 \cdot 0.75
  \]
  \[
  = 0.025 + 0.525
  \]
  \[
  = 0.55
  \]

Now, compute \( P(C|D) \):
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.55} = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.0455
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{22} \approx 0.0455}
\]

So the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.0455"}
```
