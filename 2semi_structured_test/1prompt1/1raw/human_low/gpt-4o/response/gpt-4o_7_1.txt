To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The formula for Bayes' Theorem in this context is:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]

where:
- \( P(C | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of getting the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of getting the description.

To solve this problem, we'll make a few reasonable assumptions based on the information provided.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(C) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, totaling 100 professors. 
   \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)** (Probability of picking a humanities professor):
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(D | H) \) and \( P(D | C) \)**:
   Given the description, Jason seems to have traits (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys reading and exploring) that are more commonly associated with humanities professors than computer science professors.

   Letâ€™s assume:
   \[ P(D | H) = 0.9 \] (high likelihood he's a humanities professor given the description)
   \[ P(D | C) = 0.1 \] (lower likelihood he's a computer science professor given the description)

4. **Overall Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   This is the total probability of getting the description, which is a weighted average of the likelihoods:
   \[ P(D) = P(D | C) \times P(C) + P(D | H) \times P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately 0.0357.

Hence, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.0357"}
