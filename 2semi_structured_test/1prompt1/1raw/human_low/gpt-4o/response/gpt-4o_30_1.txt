To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how it can be applied:

Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We know the following:
- The number of computer science professors \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The number of humanities professors \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We are also given Jason's description and asked to determine \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

However, in the absence of specific likelihood \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) values, we may assume a certain prior probability. Given that the description of Jason appears more aligned with traits commonly associated with humanities professors rather than the technical nature often attributed to computer science professors, we may qualitatively assess these likelihoods. 

If we make a reasonable assumption:
- The description aligns far more with humanities professor traits (\( P(D | H) \))
- The description aligns less with computer science professor traits (\( P(D | C) \))

Suppose we estimate \( P(D | C) \) as very low, say 0.1, and \( P(D | H) \) as much higher, say 0.9. Applying Bayes' method with these subjective probabilities can guide an approximate prior.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting:
\[ P(D) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.9 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} = \frac{25}{700} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.0357 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is approximately:
