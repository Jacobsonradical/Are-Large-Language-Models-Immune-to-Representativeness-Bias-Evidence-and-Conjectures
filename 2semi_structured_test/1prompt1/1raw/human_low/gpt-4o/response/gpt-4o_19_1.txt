To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we do it step by step:

1. **Define the Problem Terms:**
   - Let \(A\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \(B\) be the event that Jason fits the description given.

2. **Known Probabilities:**
   - \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor before considering the description. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total, this is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - \(P(\neg A)\): The prior probability that Jason is not a computer science professor. With 75 humanities professors out of 100 total, this is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \ ).

3. **Calculate Likelihoods:**
   - \(P(B \mid A)\): The probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor. This is not given directly, so we assume it is less likely but we still need an estimate.
   - \(P(B \mid \neg A)\): The probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a humanities professor. Humanities professors are more likely to fit a description of being creative and imaginative, so this likelihood is higher than for computer science professors, again we need an estimate.

Since specific values for \(P(B \mid A)\) and \(P(B \mid \neg A)\) are not given, let's use reasonable estimates based on the description.

Letâ€™s assume:
- \(P(B \mid A) = 0.2\) (20% chance description fits a computer science professor)
- \(P(B \mid \neg A) = 0.8\) (80% chance description fits a humanities professor)

We can now use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where \(P(B)\) is the total probability that Jason fits the description and can be calculated by the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[ 
P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

So:

\[ 
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
\]

Hence the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ 
\text{{"probability": "0.077"}
\]
