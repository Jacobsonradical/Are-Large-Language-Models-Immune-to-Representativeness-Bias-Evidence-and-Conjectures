To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
3. Let \( D \) be the description fitting Jason as given.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, note the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The key step is estimating the likelihoods:
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven... not particularly technical"), it seems more fitting for the humanities group. Without specific likelihood values, we will assume \( P(D|C) \) is lower than \( P(D|H) \). Let's make a rough estimate for illustration:
- Suppose \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \)
- Suppose \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \)

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Finally,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.04 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
