To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | A) \) is the likelihood of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

From the problem:
- The total number of professors is 100 (25 in computer science and 75 in humanities).
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming the description fits equally well for professors in both fields (since no specific information was given about how the description fits each category), we assume:
\[ P(D | A) = P(D | B) = k \]

Then \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | A) \cdot P(A) + P(D | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(B) = k \cdot (P(A) + P(B)) \]
\[ P(D) = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = k \]

So,

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
