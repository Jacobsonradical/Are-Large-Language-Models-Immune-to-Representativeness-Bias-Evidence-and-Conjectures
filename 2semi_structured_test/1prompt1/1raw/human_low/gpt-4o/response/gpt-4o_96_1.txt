In order to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:

\[
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since Jason's description includes traits such as being creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven, we can reasonably assume that these traits are more common in the humanities professors than the computer science professors. Although precise probabilities are not given, let's make a reasonable estimation based on the description:

- Suppose \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \) (low probability that a creative and imaginative person with those traits is a computer science professor).
- Suppose \( P(D|H) = 0.8 \) (high probability that a creative, imaginative, and emotionally driven person is a humanities professor).

Now, let's determine \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.025 + 0.6
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.625
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.625}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.625}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = 0.04
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.04"}
\]
