To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

First, define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description that fits Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
  
The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, we need to estimate \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Since the description of Jason ("creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven") sounds more typical of a humanities professor than a computer science professor, letâ€™s assume the following reasonable estimates:
- \( P(D \mid C) \approx 0.2 \) (assuming it is relatively less likely for a computer science professor to have these traits)
- \( P(D \mid H) \approx 0.8 \) (assuming it is relatively more likely for a humanities professor to have these traits)

Now, using the law of total probability, we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C)P(C) + P(D \mid H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.0769 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.077, or 7.69%.

Here is your answer:
