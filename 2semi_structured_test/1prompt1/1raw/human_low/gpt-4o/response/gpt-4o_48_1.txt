To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability:** The probability of selecting a computer science professor or a humanities professor randomly from the group.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood:** The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Though we don't have exact numerical likelihoods for these, we would generally assess that the given description seems more fitting for a humanities professor based on the traits mentioned (e.g., creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical).

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of this description given it is a computer science professor,
   - \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of this description given it is a humanities professor.

   If we assume \( P(D|CS) \) to be very low due to the not particularly technical nature and \( P(D|H) \) to be high, we can denote these as:
   - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.1 \)  (unlikely but possible),
   - \( P(D|H) \approx 0.9 \)  (very likely).

3. **Total Probability of the Description:**
   \( P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \)
   \( P(D) = (0.1 * 0.25) + (0.9 * 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7 \)

4. **Posterior Probability:** Using Bayes' Theorem,
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 * 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.0357.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.0357"}
