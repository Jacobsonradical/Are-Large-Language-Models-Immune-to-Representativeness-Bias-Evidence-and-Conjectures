To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

We define:
- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor comes from computer science.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor comes from the humanities.
- \(P(D|CS)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): The total probability of Jason's description.

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\(CS\)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\(H\)).

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

To proceed, we need to consider \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Given the description of Jason, based on the qualitative attributes (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, passionate, not particularly technical), it seems more aligned with common perceptions of professionals in the humanities than in computer science. Hence, we assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\) is relatively low.
- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively high.

Since exact probabilities for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are not provided, we conventionally assume the likelihood ratio based on the description suggests Jason fits better with humanities professors. If we assign hypothetical values for better intuition:
- Let's say, \(P(D|CS) = 0.1\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.9\)

Now, we compute \(P(D)\):
\[P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H)\]
\[P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)\]
\[P(D) = 0.025 + 0.675\]
\[P(D) = 0.7\]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7}\]
\[P(CS|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.7}\]
\[P(CS|D) \approx 0.0357\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
