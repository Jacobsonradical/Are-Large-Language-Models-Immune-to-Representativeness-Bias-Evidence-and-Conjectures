To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Let \(CS\) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \(HUM\) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - We know from the study that:
     - \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
     - \(P(HUM) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Assess the likelihood based on the description:**
   - Let \(D\) denote the description of Jason.
   - We need to estimate \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|HUM)\):
     - Given Jason's description (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, exploring, gifted and passionate, not particularly technical), it's reasonable to assume such traits are more common among humanities professors. Therefore, we could estimate:
       - \(P(D|CS) = 0.2\)
       - \(P(D|HUM) = 0.8\)

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   - We want \(P(CS|D)\), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
   - \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - Where \( P(D) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM)
     \]
     \[
     P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
     \]

4. **Complete the calculation:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.077
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.077\).
