To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's a step-by-step outline for the computation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( P(A) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
   - \( P(B) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( P(D | A) \): The probability of the given description if Jason is a CS professor.
   - \( P(D | B) \): The probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where,
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | A) \cdot P(A) + P(D | B) \cdot P(B)
   \]

Since we have no specific information about \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \), and the description seems more fitting for a humanities professor (since it's noted Jason is "not particularly technical"), we'll use a simplifying assumption that favors humanities over CS. Let's assume:
   - \( P(D | A) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(D | B) = 0.8 \)

Then,
\[
P(D) = (0.2 \times 0.25) + (0.8 \times 0.75) = 0.05 + 0.6 = 0.65
\]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
\[
P(A | D) = \frac{0.2 \times 0.25}{0.65} = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \approx 0.0769
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.0769.
