To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS professors) in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probability question can be modeled as follows:

1. **Sample Sizes:**
   - There are 25 CS professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of randomly picking a CS professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability of randomly picking a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Hum}) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihoods:**
   We need to estimate the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is a professor in each field. To approximate this, we look at the description:
   - Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven", not particularly technical, which seems more aligned with typical traits associated with humanities professors rather than CS professors.

Assuming the traits described are less likely (quantitatively) for CS professors, we hypothesize:
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.1 \) (since he is described as “not particularly technical”).
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \approx 0.7 \) (since the traits seem more fitting for humanities professors).

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   where \( P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Hum}) \times P(\text{Hum}) \).

5. **Calculation:**
   - Numerator: \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) = 0.1 \times 0.25 = 0.025 \).
   - Denominator: 
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.7 \times 0.75) = 0.025 + 0.525 = 0.55.
     \]

   - Thus,
     \[
     P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.025}{0.55} \approx 0.0455.
     \]

Hence, the computed probability, according to the given description, that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.0455"}
