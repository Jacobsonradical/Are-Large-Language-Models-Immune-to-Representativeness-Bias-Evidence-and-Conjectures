Let's calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

Firstly, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason fits the given description.

We need to find the probability \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
So, 
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]

Let's assume that the probabilities \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are known, or you can assign them based on average insights:
- Traditionally, traits described (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not technical) are more associated with the humanities professors than with computer science professors.
- For simplicity, let's use hypothetical probabilities: 

Assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.1 \) (10% chance of a computer science professor fitting the description).
- \( P(D|H) = 0.6 \) (60% chance of a humanities professor fitting the description).

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.6 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.025 + 0.45 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.475 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C)P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.475} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.025}{0.475} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.0526 \]

Thus, 

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.0526"}}
\]
