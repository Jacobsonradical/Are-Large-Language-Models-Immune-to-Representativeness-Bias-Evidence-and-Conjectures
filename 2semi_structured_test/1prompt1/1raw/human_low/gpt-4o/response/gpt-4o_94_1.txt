To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the base rates and the evidence provided by the description.

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample. Thus, the base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor belongs to the computer science group is:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The base rate probability that a randomly chosen professor belongs to the humanities group is:

\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Jason is described as creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, and passionate, but not particularly technical. These characteristics are more commonly associated with humanities professors than with computer science professors. Without specific likelihood ratios or more precise data, we can qualitatively estimate that the description aligns better with the characteristics of a humanities professor.

However, given the base rates and weighting the qualitative alignment, we can make a reasoned estimate that:

The probability \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is lower than the base rate because the description doesn't strongly match typical technical and analytical traits often found in computer science professors and better fits the profile of humanities professors.

Considering both the base rates and the description, a plausible estimate might be around 10%.

So the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.1"}
