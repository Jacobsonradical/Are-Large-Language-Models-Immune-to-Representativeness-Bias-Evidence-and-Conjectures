To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the relevant components:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The probability that Jason is from the computer science group (prior probability) is:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - The probability that Jason is from the humanities group (prior probability) is:
     \[
     P(Humanities) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihoods:
     - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
     - \( P(\text{Description} | Humanities) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

   Given Jason is described as "creative, imaginative, often emotionally driven, enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring, and is not particularly technical," it seems more characteristic of a humanities professor.
   
   As a rough estimate (since exact probabilities aren't available):
   - Let's assume:
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.1
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Description} | Humanities) = 0.9
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - To find the posterior probability \( P(CS | \text{Description}) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
     - Where:
       \[
       P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Humanities) \times P(Humanities)
       \]
     - Substituting the values:
       \[
       P(\text{Description}) = (0.1 \times 0.25) + (0.9 \times 0.75)
       \]
       \[
       P(\text{Description}) = 0.025 + 0.675 = 0.7
       \]

     - Now calculate the posterior probability:
       \[
       P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.1 \times 0.25}{0.7} = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \approx 0.0357
       \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.036.
