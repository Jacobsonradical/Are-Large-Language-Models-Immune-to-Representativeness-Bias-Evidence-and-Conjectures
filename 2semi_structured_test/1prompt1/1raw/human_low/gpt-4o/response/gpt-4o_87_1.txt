To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description matching Jason's personality.

We need:
1. \( P(A) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): the probability that the description matches, given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): the total probability that the description matches any professor.

First, we know the overall distribution:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Hence, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

For humanities professors:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, let's assume (hypothetically) the probability \( P(B|CS) \) (the description matching a computer science professor) is much lower compared to \( P(B|H) \) (the description matching a humanities professor). But without specific values for these probabilities, we can make an informed assumption that the description is more likely to fit a humanities professor based on the creative, imaginative, emotionally driven aspects mentioned.

We approximate \( P(B|CS) \) as quite low compared to \( P(B|H) \), let's assume:

\[ P(B|CS) \approx 0.1 \] 
\[ P(B|H) \approx 0.9 \]

To find total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.9 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.675 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.0357 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.036"} \]
