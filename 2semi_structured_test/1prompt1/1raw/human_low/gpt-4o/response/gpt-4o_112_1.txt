To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Given:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since "Jason enjoys traveling, reading, and exploring. He is gifted and passionate, though not particularly technical," we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of these traits appearing in computer science versus humanities professors. Given that the description is very much aligned with traits more common in humanities (creative, imaginative, emotionally driven, not particularly technical), we'll make the following plausible assumptions (these are hypothetical and could be adjusted with more detailed data):

- The likelihood of such a description among computer science professors (\(P(B|A)\)) is low, say 0.1.
- The likelihood of such a description among humanities professors (\(P(B|\neg A)\)) is high, say 0.8.

Now we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 + 0.8 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.025 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.625 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.1 \cdot 0.25}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.025}{0.625} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.04 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.04"}
