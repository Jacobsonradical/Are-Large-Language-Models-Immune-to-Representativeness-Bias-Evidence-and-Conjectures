To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This involves computing the conditional probability based on the given description.

First, we need to define some probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): Probability that a professor matches Jason's description.

Next, since we know the number of professors in each group:
- There are 25 computer science professors, and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' Theorem tells us that:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We have to assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

While we can't determine exact probabilities from the given data, we need a reasonable estimate:

Given Jason is "creative and imaginative, often emotionally driven" and "not particularly technical," it seems these traits might be more common in humanities professors. Therefore, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) could be a lower probability, say 0.2.
- \( P(D | H) \) could be a higher probability, say 0.8.

Now, we need \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2 \cdot 0.25) + (0.8 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.05 + 0.6 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

We can now compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.2 \cdot 0.25)}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.05}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.077 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.077.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.077"}
