To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor without any other information is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor without any other information is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let \( T \) be the event that a professor fits Jason's description.
   - We need to estimate \( P(T | CS) \), the probability that a computer science professor fits Jason's description.
   - We also need to estimate \( P(T | H) \), the probability that a humanities professor fits Jason's description.
   
   Since Jason’s description includes traits like enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not liking drawing or writing, these are more strongly associated with computer science professors. For computational simplicity, let’s make an assumption:
   - Assume \( P(T | CS) = 0.8 \) (80% of computer science professors fit Jason's description).
   - Assume \( P(T | H) = 0.1 \) (10% of humanities professors fit Jason's description).

3. **Posterior Probabilities**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | T) = \frac{P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(T)}
   \]
   Where \( P(T) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(T) = P(T | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(T | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substitute the known probabilities:
   \[
   P(T) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(T) = 0.6 + 0.025 = 0.625
   \]

   Now, calculate \( P(CS | T) \):
   \[
   P(CS | T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.625} = \frac{0.6}{0.625} = 0.96
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
