To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be stated as:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) }{P(\text{Description})} \]

We need to calculate each term:

1. \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \):
   - Number of Computer Science professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 100
   - So, \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. \( P(\text{Humanities}) \):
   - Number of Humanities professors = 25
   - Total number of professors = 100
   - So, \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \):
   - Based on the given description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which aligns more with traits of a computer science professor. 
   - Given the descriptions, we might approximate the probabilities that this description fits a computer science professor more closely and a humanities professor less closely. For simplicity:
     - Let’s assume that 90% of the computer science professors match Jason's description, so \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) = 0.9 \).
     - Let’s assume that 10% of the humanities professors match Jason's description, so \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \).

4. \( P(\text{Description}) \):
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

Now, we can apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
