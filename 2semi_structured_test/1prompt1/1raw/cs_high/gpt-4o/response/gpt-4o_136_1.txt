To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Our goal is to find \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's description}) \).

Given:
- \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as Jason's description.

We need to estimate the likelihood of the description given the background (CS or Humanities). Jason's preference and hobbies (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) seem to align more with the typical interests of a computer science professor.

While we do not have precise probabilities for \( P(D \mid A) \) and \( P(D \mid B) \), we can make a reasonable assumption based on the description provided.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid A) = 0.9 \) (since Jason's characteristics highly fit the profile of a CS professor).
- \( P(D \mid B) = 0.1 \) (since Jason's characteristics are less likely to fit a Humanities professor).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid A) P(A) + P(D \mid B) P(B) \]

So:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = 0.9643 \]

Rounding to four decimal places, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
