To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayesâ€™ theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here is how we determine each component:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description matching Jason given that he is a computer science professor. Based on the description, it seems quite likely that he is a computer science professor, especially considering his interests in coding and mathematical puzzles. We might estimate this probability to be high, let's assume 0.95.

3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description matching Jason. This can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
where \( A^c \) is the event that he is a humanities professor.

Let's estimate:
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The likelihood of the description matching Jason given that he is a humanities professor. Considering his strong association with coding and mathematical puzzles, this probability could be assumed to be quite low. Let's assume 0.05.

- \( P(A^c) \): The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor.
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.95 \cdot 0.75) + (0.05 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7125 + 0.0125 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7125}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.983 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.983.
