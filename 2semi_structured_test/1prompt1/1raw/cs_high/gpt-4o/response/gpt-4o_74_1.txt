The goal is to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. To do this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( P(CS|D) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of the description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need \( P(D) \), which can be computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Without specific likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we need to rely on given context. Jason is described as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—all activities and interests strongly associated with computer science rather than humanities.

Thus, let’s assume that:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is quite high (e.g., 0.9)
- \( P(D|H) \) is quite low (e.g., 0.1)

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Then:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
