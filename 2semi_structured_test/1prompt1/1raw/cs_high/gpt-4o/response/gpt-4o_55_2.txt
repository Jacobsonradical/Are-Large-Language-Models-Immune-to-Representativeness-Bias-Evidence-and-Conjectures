Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability. Here's the Bayesian reasoning step by step:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(Hum) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

   Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:

   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(Desc|CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(Desc|Hum) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

   Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, along with his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing, suggests that he is more likely to be a computer science professor. Let's assume:

   \[
   P(Desc|CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc|Hum) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probabilities (Bayes' Theorem)**:
   - \( P(CS|Desc) \): Probability that the professor is from computer science given the description.
   - \( P(Hum|Desc) \): Probability that the professor is from the humanities given the description.

   Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)}
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum|Desc) = \frac{P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}{P(Desc)}
   \]

   Overall probability of the description:

   \[
   P(Desc) = P(Desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   \[
   P(Desc) = (0.9) \cdot (0.75) + (0.1) \cdot (0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now compute \( P(CS|Desc) \):

   \[
   P(CS|Desc) = \frac{(0.9) \cdot (0.75)}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
