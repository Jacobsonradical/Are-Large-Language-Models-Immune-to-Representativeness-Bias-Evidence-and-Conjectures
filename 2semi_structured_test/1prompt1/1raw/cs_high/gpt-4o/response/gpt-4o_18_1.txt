To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We start by calculating the relevant probabilities.

We know the following:
1. There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (H).
2. The base probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) is 75 out of 100:  
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
3. The base probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)) is 25 out of 100:  
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Jason’s description fits traits more commonly associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing). Let’s denote:
- P(Desc | CS) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- P(Desc | H) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

We need to estimate these probabilities. Given Jason’s description, it seems more likely that such a description fits a computer science professor much better than a humanities professor. For argument's sake, let’s assume:
\[ P(Desc | CS) = 0.9 \]  
\[ P(Desc | H) = 0.1 \]

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(CS | Desc), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc | H) \times P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643. 

So the formatted answer is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
