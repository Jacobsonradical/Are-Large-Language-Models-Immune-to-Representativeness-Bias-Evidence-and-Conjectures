To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

First, let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(Description | CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Description | H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to calculate:
- \( P(CS | Description) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Without specific probabilities \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | H) \), we can assume that Jason's description is more likely to fit a computer science professor, given his interest in coding and mathematical puzzles. Therefore \( P(Description | CS) \) is likely higher than \( P(Description | H) \).

To simplify, let's assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) = 0.8 \) (highly likely given interests)
- \( P(Description | H) = 0.2 \) (less likely given interests)

Now compute the probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.6}{0.6 + 0.05} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
