To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \(CS\) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \(HU\) = Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\) = The provided description fits Jason

We are interested in computing \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description.

1. Prior probabilities:
   - There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

   - There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(HU) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. Likelihoods:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) should be high as the description fits the typical profile of a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|HU) \) should be low as the description seems less likely to fit the typical profile of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assign:
\( P(D|CS) = 1 \) (Description perfectly matches a computer science professor)
\( P(D|HU) = 0.1 \) (Description does not match well with a humanities professor)

3. Calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.75 + 0.025 = 0.775 \]

4. Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.968 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.968.
