To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

We are given:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's define the following:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the description given.

We need to compute \( P(C \mid D) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, compute the priors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, assume \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Since Jason's interests and traits seem to match more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor (interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles), let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is high, say, \( 0.9 \)
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is low, say, \( 0.1 \)

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, compute \( P(C \mid D) \):
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.96 (or 96%).

Thus, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.96"}
