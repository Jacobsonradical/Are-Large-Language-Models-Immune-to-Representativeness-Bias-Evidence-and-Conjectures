To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

Let:
- \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We want to compute \( P(CS|D) \). According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we calculate \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the description, we note that his interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and personality traits (ambitious, conservative, and highly creative) strongly align with typical traits of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Without specific probabilities, we can assume \( P(D|CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume based on the description that these probabilities are:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

We then use the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
