To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, you can apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across all professors.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

1. Prior probabilities:
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. Descriptions likelihood:
   - The provided details suggest Jason's interests and skills align more with computer science, so we'll assume \( P(desc|CS) \) is relatively high. Suppose \( P(desc|CS) = 0.9 \)
   - Since the description is less aligned with humanities, suppose \( P(desc|Hum) = 0.1 \)

3. Total probability of the description:
   \[ P(desc) = P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(desc|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
   \[ P(desc) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(desc) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

4. Applying Bayesâ€™ theorem:
   \[ P(CS|desc) = \frac{P(desc|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(desc)} \]
   \[ P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|desc) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(CS|desc) \approx 0.9643 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
