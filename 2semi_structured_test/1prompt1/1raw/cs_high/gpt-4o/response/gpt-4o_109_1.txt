To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**

   - Probability that a randomly selected professor from the total pool is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): There are 75 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

   - Probability that a randomly selected professor from the total pool is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): There are 25 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

2. **Likelihoods:**

   - We need to determine the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) and a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typical activities of computer science professors. Therefore, it is more likely that he is a computer science professor.
  
   For the sake of illustration, let's assume:
     \[
     P(D|CS) = 1 \quad \text{(very likely)}
     \]
     \[
     P(D|H) = 0.1 \quad \text{(less likely)}
     \]

3. **Posterior Probability:**

   Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(P(CS|D)\)):

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{(1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.025}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.775}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) \approx 0.968
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.968.
