To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we are looking for \( P(A | B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the given description of Jason.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \) the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(A^c) \) the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need:
- \( P(B | A) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the characteristics in Jason's description that align with a professional in computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we can hypothesize that these characteristics are more likely for computer science professors than humanities professors. Hence, we would reasonably assume \( P(B | A) \) is greater than \( P(B | A^c) \).

For ease, let's say:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.9 \) (since the description fits typical traits of a computer science professor well).
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.1 \) (since the description doesn't fit typical traits of a humanities professor well).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c)}
\]

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[
Numerator = 0.9 \times 0.75 = 0.675
\]

\[
Denominator = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Then:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer is:
\{"probability": "0.9643"\}
