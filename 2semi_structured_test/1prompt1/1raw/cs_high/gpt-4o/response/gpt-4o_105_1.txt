To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem enables us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's find each component:
1. Prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, these traits seem more in line with a computer science professor. Let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \]

3. Total probability \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, plug in these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
