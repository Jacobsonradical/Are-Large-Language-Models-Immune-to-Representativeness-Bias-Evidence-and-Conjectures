Given the details of Jason's interests and personality traits, we can employ Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. 

Let's denote \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor. We need to compute:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) \]

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Here's what we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

However, we do not have exact probabilities for \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \) without further empirical data. Instead, we can make a qualitative assessment based on the description provided.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with the interests typical of computer science professors. His lack of interest in drawing or writing might less likely describe a humanities professor.

Assuming that the description given is significantly more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we can estimate:

\[ P(\text{description} | C) \gg P(\text{description} | H) \]

Even without exact figures, this significant difference shifts the probability strongly in favor of Jason being a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(\text{description} | C) \approx 1 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \approx 0 \)

Thus,

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{1 \times 0.75}{(1 \times 0.75) + (0 \times 0.25)} = \frac{0.75}{0.75} = 1 \]

However, to be conservative and due to the qualitative nature of our assessment, it is more rational to give a very high probability instead of an absolute 1. Therefore:

\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx 0.9 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is high, but not absolute.
