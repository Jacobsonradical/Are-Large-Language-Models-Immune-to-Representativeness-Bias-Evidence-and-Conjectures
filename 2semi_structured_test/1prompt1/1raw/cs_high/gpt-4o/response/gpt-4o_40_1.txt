To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem for conditional probability. We'll need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, by considering the relative likelihoods of such a person being in either the computer science or the humanities group.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given.

We seek \( P(CS|D) \), the conditional probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Likewise, the total probability \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to assign prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the given information:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- To estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we consider the description provided. Jasonâ€™s interests and traits seem more strongly aligned with those typical of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Assuming that the description is four times more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor:
\[ P(D|CS) = 4 \cdot P(D|H) \]

Now let's denote:
\[ P(D|H) = x \]
\[ P(D|CS) = 4x \]

Substitute these into our total probability formula:
\[ P(D) = (4x \cdot 0.75) + (x \cdot 0.25) = 3x + 0.25x = 3.25x \]

Finally, plug into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{4x \cdot 0.75}{3.25x} = \frac{3x}{3.25x} = \frac{3}{3.25} = \frac{3}{3.25} \approx 0.923 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.923.
