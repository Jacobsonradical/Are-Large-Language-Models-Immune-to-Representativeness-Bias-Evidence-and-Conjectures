To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Here's the situation:

1. We know that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. A description of a random professor among these 100 is given.

The steps are as follows:

- **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
  - Probability that a randomly chosen person is a computer science professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
  - Probability that a randomly chosen person is a humanities professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

- **Likelihood**:
  - Probability that Jason fits the profile given, among computer science professors.
  - Probability that Jason fits the profile given, among humanities professors.

Given the description, Jason has characteristics that seem more aligned with computer science, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

- **Posterior Probability using Bayes’ theorem**:
  \[
  P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
  \]

Given that the description seems more likely for a computer science professor, we assume:

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \approx 1 \) (as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are very indicative of CS)

- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0 \) (these traits are less common in humanities)

Thus, Bayes' theorem simplifies as follows:

\[
P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 0 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.75}{0.75} = 1
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is very high, almost certain, given the provided description.

Therefore, the probability is:
