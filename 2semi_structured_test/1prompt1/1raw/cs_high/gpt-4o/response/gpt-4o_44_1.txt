Given the description, let's use Bayesian reasoning to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, let's establish our hypothesis:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is one of the humanities professors.

Next, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, we need to consider the likelihood of the description given each hypothesis:
- The description mentions that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with traits of a computer science professor than a humanities professor, and thus we assume that \( P(D|H_{CS}) > P(D|H_{H}) \).
- Similarly, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, activities that are more associated with humanities professors.

Given these considerations, we can intuitively assign these likelihoods:
- Let's suppose \( P(D|H_{CS}) = 0.9 \).
- Let's suppose \( P(D|H_{H}) = 0.1 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D|H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D|H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H})} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(H_{CS}|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the response is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
