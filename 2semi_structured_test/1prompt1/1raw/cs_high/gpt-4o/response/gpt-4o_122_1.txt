Given the description of Jason, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that he is a computer science professor. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description provided.

First, let's outline each component needed for the calculation:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description being drawn from the sample (combined probability from both groups).

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):**

   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)):**

   We need to estimate how likely the description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.
   
   Based on the description:
   - Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles: highly indicative of computer science.
   - Although being highly creative, not enjoying drawing or writing could align with the character traits of someone in computer science.

   Suppose we assume:
   \[
   P(B|\text{CS Prof}) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Total Probability (\( P(B) \)):**

   The descriptionâ€™s overall probability, considering both groups:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|\text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof}) + P(B|\text{Humanities Prof}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Prof})
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability (\( P(A|B) \)):**

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof} | B) = \frac{P(B | \text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof} | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS Prof} | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
