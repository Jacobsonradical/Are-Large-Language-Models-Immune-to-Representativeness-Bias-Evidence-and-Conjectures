To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description fits Jason.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability that the description fits a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

From the problem description:
- The number of computer science professors \( n_C = 75 \).
- The number of humanities professors \( n_H = 25 \).
- Total number of professors \( n = 100 \).

Therefore:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need reasonable estimates for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (which align more with activities common among computer science professors), it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of such a description fitting a computer science professor is higher than it fitting a humanities professor.

Assume:
\[ P(D | C) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | H) = 0.1 \]

Now we can compute \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C | D) \):

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:
