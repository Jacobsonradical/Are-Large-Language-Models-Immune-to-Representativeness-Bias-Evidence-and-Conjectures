To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new information.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (C): 75
- Number of humanities professors (H): 25
- Total number of professors: 100

We want to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. This requires considering the prior probability and the likelihood of the description given each category.

Steps:
1. Compute the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. Assess the likelihood of the description for both computer science professors and humanities professors. Let's denote the description by D.

Given how closely Jason's activities and traits align with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and being highly creative without an affinity for drawing or writing), it's reasonable to assume a higher likelihood for computer science professors than humanities professors.

Let's assume:
   \[
   P(D|C) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.1
   \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
   \]
   
Where \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.7
   \]

Finally, calculate \( P(C|D) \):
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(C|D) = 0.9643 \approx 0.96
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.96"}
