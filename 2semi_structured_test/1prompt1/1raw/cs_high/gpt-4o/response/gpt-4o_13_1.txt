To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can employ Bayes' theorem, which is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. Let’s define the probabilities needed:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(Hum) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

   Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \( P(Jason|CS) \): Probability that Jason matches the given description if he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(Jason|Hum) \): Probability that Jason matches the given description if he is a humanities professor.

   Based on Jason’s interests and personal traits—coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing—it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor. Let’s assume that:
   \[
   P(Jason|CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(Jason|Hum) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - \( P(CS|Jason) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
   - \( P(Hum|Jason) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor given his description.

   By Bayes' theorem, we have:
   \[
   P(CS|Jason) = \frac{P(Jason|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)}
   \]
   Where \( P(Jason) \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(Jason) = P(Jason|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(Jason) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, we substitute back to find \( P(CS|Jason) \):
   \[
   P(CS|Jason) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.
