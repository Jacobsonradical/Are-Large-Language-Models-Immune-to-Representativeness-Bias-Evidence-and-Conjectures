To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(A | B)\) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.
- \(P(B | A)\) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of Jason's description.

From the study, we know:
- There are 75 CS professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Let \(A_{\text{CS}}\) denote the event that Jason is a CS professor and \(A_{\text{Human}}\) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor. Therefore:
\[
P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(A_{\text{Human}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need \(P(B | A_{\text{CS}})\) and \(P(B | A_{\text{Human}})\). Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, creative, but does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more typical for a CS professor than a humanities professor. For simplicity, let's assume:
\[
P(B | A_{\text{CS}}) = 0.8  (\text{high likelihood})
\]
\[
P(B | A_{\text{Human}}) = 0.2  (\text{low likelihood})
\]

Using the law of total probability, we calculate \(P(B)\):
\[
P(B) = P(B | A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B | A_{\text{Human}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Human}})
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(A_{\text{CS}} | B)\):
\[
P(A_{\text{CS}} | B) = \frac{P(B | A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A_{\text{CS}} | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65}
\]
\[
P(A_{\text{CS}} | B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

To answer the question in the required format:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.923"}
\]
