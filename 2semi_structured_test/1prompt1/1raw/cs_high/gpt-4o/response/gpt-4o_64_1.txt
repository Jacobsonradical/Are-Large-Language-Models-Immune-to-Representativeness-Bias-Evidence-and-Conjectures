To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

The relevant information to consider includes:
- The number of computer science professors (CSP) is 75.
- The number of humanities professors (HP) is 25.
- The total number of professors is 100.

We'll denote:
- \(P(CSP)\) as the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \(P(HP)\) as the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|CSP)\) as the probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|HP)\) as the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\) as the total probability of the description fitting any professor.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CSP) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(HP) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|CSP)\) and \(P(D|HP)\). Given that Jason's description emphasizes traits and interests typically associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it's reasonable to assume that:

- \(P(D|CSP)\) is high: let’s assume it is \(0.8\).
- \(P(D|HP)\) is relatively low: let’s assume it is \(0.2\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CSP|D) = \frac{P(D|CSP) \cdot P(CSP)}{P(D)} \]

Where \(P(D)\) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CSP) \cdot P(CSP) + P(D|HP) \cdot P(HP) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we can compute \(P(CSP|D)\):
\[ P(CSP|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CSP|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CSP|D) = \frac{6}{6.5} \]
\[ P(CSP|D) = 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
