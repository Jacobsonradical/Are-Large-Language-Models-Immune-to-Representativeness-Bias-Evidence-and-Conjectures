To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimates as we get more data. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of getting this description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of getting this description.

Initially, the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(A') \) are based on the distribution of professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \):

Given the description of Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), it is reasonable to assume that such a description is more likely to be of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. For a qualitative estimate, let's say:

\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \] (90% likely Jason is described this way if he is in computer science)
\[ P(B|A') = 0.2 \] (20% likely Jason is described this way if he is in humanities)

Now we can find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.931.

Here is the answer in the specified format:
