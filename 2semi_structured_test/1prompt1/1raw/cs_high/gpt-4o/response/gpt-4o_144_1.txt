To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence.

Given:
- Total number of professors (P) = 100
- Number of computer science professors (C) = 75
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 25

We are provided with the description of Jason, and we need to calculate the probability that he is a computer science professor given his description.

Let \( CS \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( Hum \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a professor is in computer science (without considering the description).
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Firstly, we assume the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more aligned with characteristics typically associated with computer science professors, we can assign higher likelihood to \( P(D|CS) \) compared to \( P(D|Hum) \).

Let's denote:
\[ P(D|CS) = p_{CS} \]
\[ P(D|Hum) = p_{Hum} \]

While we don't have exact numerical values for \( p_{CS} \) and \( p_{Hum} \), we can reason that \( p_{CS} \) is relatively high and \( p_{Hum} \) is relatively low. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume reasonable values based on this consideration:
\[ p_{CS} = 0.8 \]
\[ p_{Hum} = 0.2 \]

Now, we need \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{6}{6.5} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923, which can be rounded as needed.

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.923"}
