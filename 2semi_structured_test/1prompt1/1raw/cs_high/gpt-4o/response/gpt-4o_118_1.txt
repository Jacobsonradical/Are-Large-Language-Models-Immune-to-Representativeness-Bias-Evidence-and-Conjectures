To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Assessing Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood that Jason's description would match a computer science professor, \( P(description|CS) \)
   - The likelihood that Jason's description would match a humanities professor, \( P(description|H) \)

Given the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are stereotypically more characteristic of computer science professors than humanities professors. So we assign:
   - \( P(description|CS) \) = high (let’s assume 0.9 for quantification)
   - \( P(description|H) \) = low (let’s assume 0.1 for quantification)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description)}
   \]

   Where \( P(description) \):
   \[
   P(description) = P(description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(description|H) \times P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(description) = 0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25
   \]

   \[
   P(description) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculate \( P(CS|description) \):
   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Here's the formatted answer:
```
{"probability": "0.9643"}
```
