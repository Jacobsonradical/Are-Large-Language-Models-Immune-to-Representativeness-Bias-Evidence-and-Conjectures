To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description, given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's compute \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors total.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let's compute \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability of being a humanities professor:
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors total.
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he's a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A^c) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given he's a humanities professor. Given the description, it's more likely Jason is a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. We'll assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]
and
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \]

Finally, compute \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
