To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we have to use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given for Jason.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find \( P(A | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | A) \cdot P(A) + P(D | B) \cdot P(B) \]

To simplify, we need to assume the likelihoods \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | B) \). Given Jason's interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it seems more likely that he would fit the profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. For the sake of argument, let's assume that:
- \( P(D | A) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | B) \approx 0.2 \)

Now we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Then, we find \( P(A | D) \):

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A | D) \approx 0.931 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.93"} \]
