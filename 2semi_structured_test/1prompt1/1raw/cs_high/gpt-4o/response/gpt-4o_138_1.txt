To compute the probability mathematically, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A given that B is true,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B given that A is true,
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A,
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

In this context, let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the description that Jason fits.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
- And \( P(A^C) \), the probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \), which are the probabilities of fitting Jason's description given the professor is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. Considering Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, we might assume it's more likely that he is a computer science professor. For simplicity (and without exact data), letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (high likelihood for computer scientists)
- \( P(B|A^C) \approx 0.2 \) (lower likelihood for humanities professors)

Finally, we need to compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^C) \cdot P(A^C) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
