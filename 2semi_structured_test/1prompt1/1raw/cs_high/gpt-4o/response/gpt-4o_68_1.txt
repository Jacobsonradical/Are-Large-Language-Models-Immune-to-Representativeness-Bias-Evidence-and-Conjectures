To solve this, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we find the priors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we use the description of Jason, which mentions his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying writing (traits more commonly associated with computer science professors).

Let \( D \) represent the observed description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we can find \( P(H|D) \):

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

But since both probabilities sum up to 1, and we are only interested in \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Assuming the traits described are highly indicative of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 1 \)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0 \)

So,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{1 \cdot 0.75 + 0 \cdot 0.25} \]

Since \( P(D|H) \approx 0 \), the denominator simplifies to:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.75}{0.75} = 1 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is very high.

Let's formalize:

{"probability": "0.92"}

(Note: The precise value of 0.92 is chosen to account for some subjective uncertainty in assuming \( P(D|H) \approx 0 \); otherwise, it would theoretically be closer to 1 if we assume perfect associations.)
