To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS | Description)), we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | Description) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(Description | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Description) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

First, let's establish the prior probability, \( P(CS) \), which is based on how many computer science professors are in the sample:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) \), is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, consider the probability of Jason's description given that he is in computer science versus the humanities. The description fits a typical profile for a computer science professor more closely (coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing). Therefore, we can reasonably assume:

\[ P(Description | CS) \gg P(Description | H) \]

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(Description | CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(Description | H) = 0.2 \]

Now, calculate \( P(Description) \):
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.65 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS | Description) \):
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.923 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.923"} \]
