To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, we need to consider the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor, P(CS), is 75/100 = 0.75.
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor, P(Hum), is 25/100 = 0.25.

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given each category. Since we don't have detailed likelihoods, we shall assume that Jason's description is more typical of a computer science professor due to his interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, P(D|CS), is high. We will assume P(D|CS) = 0.9.
- The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, P(D|Hum), is low. We will assume P(D|Hum) = 0.1.

Now we use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
