To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote the events:
- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P \): The event that Jason's description fits the provided profile.

We know:
1. \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
2. \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We need to find \( P(C|P) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(C|P) = \frac{P(P|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(P)} \]

Where:
- \( P(P|C) \): The probability that the description fits given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(P|H) \): The probability that the description fits given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(P) \): The total probability of the description fitting.

Since we don't have specific probabilities for \( P(P|C) \) and \( P(P|H) \) and given that the description mentions characteristics more aligned with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we can reasonably assume that \( P(P|C) \) is higher than \( P(P|H) \).

For simplification, letâ€™s assume \( P(P|C) \) and \( P(P|H) \) are proportional to the number of professors in each group, and consider:
\[ P(P|C) = 1 \]
\[ P(P|H) = \epsilon \]

Given the small number of professors fitting in these specific groups and combined with the provided profile characteristics, \( P(P) \) can be expanded as:
\[ P(P) = P(P|C) \cdot P(C) + P(P|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(P) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + \epsilon \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(P) \approx 0.75 \ (assuming \ \epsilon \approx 0) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(C|P) \approx \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.75} = 1 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is very high, close to 1.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
