First, we need to consider the prior probabilities of Jason being from either computer science or humanities. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample of 100 professors.

So, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor is \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we'll consider the likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Jason's interests and traits such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being described as highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing fit more closely with typical characteristics of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

However, since we don't have explicit probability distributions for these traits among the two groups, we'll rely on the assumption that such characteristics are more likely in computer science professors.

Since the likelihood of these characteristics is not quantifiable but seems to match strongly with a computer science profile, we will weight this qualitatively. Given these strong discipline-related motivations in Jason's description, it is reasonable to assume a higher likelihood given the computer science background.

Thus, while the problem is asking for a Bayesian update, we lack specific likelihood ratios but can still reason qualitatively.

Since our prior probability is already high and the traits specified in Jason's description strongly align with computer science,
it would not change drastically from the prior.

Therefore, we can conclude that it's very likely Jason is a computer science professor:

{"probability": "0.9"}
