To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which involves prior probabilities and likelihoods.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given:
- Total number of professors \( N = 100 \)
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

We need to compute \( P(C \mid E) \), where \( E \) is the evidence given by Jason's description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

However, \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the evidence) can be computed as:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, we need to estimate \( P(E \mid C) \) and \( P(E \mid H) \). The description of Jason suggests he has characteristics such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical for a computer science professor. Additionally, he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which makes it less likely for him to be in humanities.

Let's assume:
\[ P(E \mid C) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(E \mid H) \approx 0.1 \]

Then:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid E) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
