Given the description provided for Jason and the context of the study, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason matches the given description.

First, let's define what we know:

- \(P(A)\): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \(P(\neg A)\): The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

To compute \(P(B|A)\), which is the probability of matching the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, let us assume that professors in computer science are more likely to match the description based on the given factors (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.). 

Similarly, the likelihood \(P(B|\neg A)\), the probability of a humanities professor matching this description, could be presumed lower since the interests and typical profiles listed (coding, mathematical puzzles) align less with humanities.

Although exact probabilities for \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\) are not numerically provided here, we can make qualitative approximations:
- Suppose \(P(B|A) = 0.8\)
- Suppose \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.2\)

Now, we calculate \(P(B)\), the total probability of observing Jason's description:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \approx \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.923"}
\]
