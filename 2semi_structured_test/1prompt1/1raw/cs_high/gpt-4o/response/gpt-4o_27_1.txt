To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jason having the given description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of getting the given description.

We know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Hence, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Assume:
- \( P(D|C) \): Likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor is \( \alpha \).
- \( P(D|H) \): Likelihood of the description fitting a humanities professor is \( \beta \).

Since this is a Bayesian problem and you didn't provide exact values for \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), we assume that the description fits a computer science professor much better (given the indicators such as coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.).

Given the indicators and considering that Jasonâ€™s description fits a computer science professor substantially better than a humanities professor, we can assume that \( P(D|C) \) is significantly larger than \( P(D|H) \).

For simplicity, often in such scenarios, \( \alpha \) is assumed to be much larger compared to \( \beta \). If we assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

Then:
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

So,
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.964"}
