To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps to compute the probability:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor (CS) randomly is \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor (H) randomly is \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**: 
   - We need to estimate how likely it is to get the description given that Jason is a computer science professor vs a humanities professor. Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging (activities likely associated with computer science professors), we can consider these activities are more common among computer science professors.
   - Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(D|H) \) be the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
   - For simplicity, assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood given the activities) and \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the activities).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
   \]

   \[
   P(CS|D) = 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643. 

So, the desired probability is:
