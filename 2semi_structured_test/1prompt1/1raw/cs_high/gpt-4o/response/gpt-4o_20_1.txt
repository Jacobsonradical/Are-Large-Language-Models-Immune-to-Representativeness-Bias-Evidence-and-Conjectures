To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our prior beliefs based on new information.

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor, \(P(C)\), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor, \(P(H)\), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \(P(\text{Description} \mid C)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(\text{Description} \mid H)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it's reasonable to assume that the description fits better for a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) = 0.9\)
- \(P(\text{Description} \mid H) = 0.1\)

4. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[
P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Where \(P(\text{Description})\) is the total probability of the description occurring and can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid C) \times P(C) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \times P(H)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, compute the posterior probability:

\[
P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643 or 96.43%.
