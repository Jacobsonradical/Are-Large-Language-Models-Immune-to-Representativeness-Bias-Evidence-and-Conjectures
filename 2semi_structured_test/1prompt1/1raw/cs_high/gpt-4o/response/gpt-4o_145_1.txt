To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( CS \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the description given of Jason.

We are asked to compute \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities based on the numbers of professors:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description highly suggests someone involved with computer science due to the interests and activities listed. We'll assume that the probability \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \).

Given the coding and mathematics-related interests, let's estimate:
\[
P(D|CS) \approx 0.9
\]
\[
P(D|H) \approx 0.1
\]

The total probability of the description \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now applying Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
{"probability": "0.9643"}
\]
