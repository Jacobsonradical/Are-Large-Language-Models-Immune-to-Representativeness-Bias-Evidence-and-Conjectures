To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a random professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a random professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(CS | D) \): Probability that the professor is a computer science professor given the description.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

To find \( P(CS | D) \), we need \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, which is given by:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming that the description Jason fits better with the computer science professors than with the humanities professors, we can estimate the probabilities:
- Let’s assume \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (an assumption that the description is highly likely for a computer science professor)
- Let’s assume \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (an assumption that the description is less likely for a humanities professor)

Now, using these probabilities:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.75)}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.

Answer in the required format:
{"probability": "0.923"}
