To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis, given new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant terms:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{H}) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | \text{H}) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

We are looking for:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) P(\text{H}) \]

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need estimates for \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D | \text{H}) \). Given the description of Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys jogging but not drawing or writing), it is reasonable to assume that these characteristics are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) = 0.80 \) (high likelihood given the description fits a computer science profile)
- \( P(D | \text{H}) = 0.20 \) (lower likelihood given the description fits a humanities professor less well)

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{H}) P(\text{H}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.80 \times 0.75) + (0.20 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.60 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(\text{CS} | D) \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.60}{0.65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{60}{65} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{12}{13} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) \approx 0.923 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
