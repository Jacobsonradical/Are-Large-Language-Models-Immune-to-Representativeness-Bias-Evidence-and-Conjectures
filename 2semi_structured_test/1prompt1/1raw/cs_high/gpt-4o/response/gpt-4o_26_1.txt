To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to compute the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \), where \( CS \) stands for Computer Science professor and \( D \) stands for the given description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Let's define the components:
- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability of being a Computer Science professor. Since there are 75 Computer Science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability of being a Humanities professor. Since there are 25 Humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a Humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

Since we do not have the exact values of \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we make an educated assumption based on the description, which contains traits and hobbies more typical for a Computer Science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). 

Therefore, we assume \( P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \).

Now, we compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, we compute the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
