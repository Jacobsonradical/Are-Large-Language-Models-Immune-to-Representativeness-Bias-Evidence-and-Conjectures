To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This involves calculating the posterior probability based on the given description.

Let's define:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(HUM) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc | CS) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(Desc | HUM) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(Desc) \): The overall probability of the given description.

From the sample sizes, we know:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Given the description, Jason's interests and attributes seem more aligned with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Assumptions based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science.
- Jason is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, less typical for someone in the humanities.

Though exact numerical values are not provided for \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | HUM) \), we can reasonably assume that \( P(Desc | CS) \) is higher than \( P(Desc | HUM) \).

If we assume:
- \( P(Desc | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(Desc | HUM) = 0.1 \)

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where:
\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
\[ P(Desc) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
