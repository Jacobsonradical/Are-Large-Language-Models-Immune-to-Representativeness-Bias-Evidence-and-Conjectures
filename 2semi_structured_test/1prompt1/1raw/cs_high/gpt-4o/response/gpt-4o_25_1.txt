To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Given:
- The number of computer science professors: 75
- The number of humanities professors: 25
- The total number of professors: 100

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of picking a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Since we don't have exact probabilities for the descriptions, we need to approximate based on Jason's interests and the descriptions' context:
- It's reasonable to assume \( P(D | CS) \) is relatively high given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious nature aligns more with common perceptions of computer science professors.
- Simultaneously, \( P(D | H) \) might be relatively low because these interests and traits are less stereotypical for humanities professors.

Without specific probabilities, a reasonable assumption for illustration might be:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (an assumption)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (an assumption)

We then need to calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.60}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.923"} \]
