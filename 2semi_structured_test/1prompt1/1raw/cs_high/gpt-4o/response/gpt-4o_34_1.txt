To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor
- Given description: \( D \)

We're looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's determine the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \).

Given the description of Jason enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, being highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing, it seems much more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \] (reflecting a high likelihood that a computer science professor fits the description)
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \] (reflecting a low likelihood that a humanities professor fits the description)

Finally, we calculate the total probability of the given description \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
