To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For the purpose of this calculation:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**
   The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   The probability that Jason’s description fits a computer science professor. Given the additional details about Jason (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it might be very high, say \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

4. **Complement Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   The probability that Jason’s description fits a humanities professor. Given the details about Jason not enjoying writing and drawing but enjoying coding and mathematical puzzles, this probability might be very low. It's reasonable to estimate this around \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   The total probability of Jason's description occurring. This is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   Finally, we can calculate the poster probability using Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.9643\).
