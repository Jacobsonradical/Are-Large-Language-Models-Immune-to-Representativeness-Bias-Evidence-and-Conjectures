To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem formula:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Given:
- We have 100 descriptions in total: 75 from computer science and 25 from the humanities.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor).

We need to assess how likely the description \( D \) fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, these traits are more common in the computer science field compared to the humanities.

Therefore, we will assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is high, let's assume it's 0.9 (very likely description for a computer science professor).
- \( P(D | H) \) is low, let's assume it's 0.1 (not very likely description for a humanities professor).

To compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can compute \( P(CS | D) \):
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9642857 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
