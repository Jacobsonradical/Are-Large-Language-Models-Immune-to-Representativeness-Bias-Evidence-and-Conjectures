To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We need to calculate each term in the equation:
1. \( P(C) \): Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(\text{description} | C) \): Probability that Jason has the given description given he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(\text{description}) \): Total probability that Jason has the given description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

To determine \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \):
Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and based on typical stereotypes, it's more likely that these traits are associated with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.2 \)

Now, using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.725 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) \approx 0.931 \]

So the probability is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.931"} \]
