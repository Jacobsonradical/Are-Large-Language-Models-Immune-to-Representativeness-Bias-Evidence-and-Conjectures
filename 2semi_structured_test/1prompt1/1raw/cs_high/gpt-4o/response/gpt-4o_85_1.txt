To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be described as follows:

We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let:
- \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the event that the description matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can break it down further:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to evaluate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are the probabilities of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor respectively.

Based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more indicative of a computer science professor.
- Jason is conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, enjoys jogging, and is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing. While this doesnâ€™t conclusively lean towards one field without further context, the specific interest in coding and mathematical puzzles strongly suggests a computer science background.

Assuming that the likelihood of such a description fitting a computer science professor is much higher than it fitting a humanities professor, we can reasonably estimate these as:

\[ P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \]

Plugging these values into the Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
