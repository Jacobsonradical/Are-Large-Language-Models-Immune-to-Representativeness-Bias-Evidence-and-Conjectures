To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than one of the humanities professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the probability calculation step-by-step:

1. **Base Rates**:
   - The total number of professors is 100.
   - The number of computer science professors is 75.
   - The number of humanities professors is 25.

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \quad \text{(Probability of being a computer science professor)}
   \]
   \[
   P(Humanities) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \quad \text{(Probability of being a humanities professor)}
   \]

2. **Descriptions**:
   - Jason's description indicates traits and interests such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more commonly associated with computer science professors.

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of such a description for both groups. 

   Let's denote:
   \[
   P(Description | CS) = 1 \quad \text{(Assuming the traits are very common for computer science professors)}
   \]
   \[
   P(Description | Humanities) = 0.1 \quad \text{(Assuming it's very uncommon for humanities professors to have such traits)}
   \]

4. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   
   First, we need \( P(Description) \):
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities)
   \]
   \[
   P(Description) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.025 = 0.775
   \]
   
   Finally:
   \[
   P(CS | Description) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \approx 0.9677
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9677.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
