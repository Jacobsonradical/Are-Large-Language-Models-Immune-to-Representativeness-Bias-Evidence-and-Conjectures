To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

We start by identifying the given probabilities:

1. Prior probability of being a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)):
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   
2. Prior probability of being a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)):
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

Next, we need to determine the likelihoods:

3. Likelihood of the description given that the professor is in computer science (\( P(D|CS) \)):
   This is tricky because it isn't directly given. However, based on the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging; doesn't enjoy drawing or writing), we can infer that the description is more representative of a computer science professor.
   
4. Likelihood of the description given that the professor is in humanities (\( P(D|H) \)):
   Similarly, we infer that this description is less representative of a humanities professor.

Since exact likelihood values are not provided, weâ€™ll assume descriptive traits align more strongly with computer science professors.

For illustration, let's hypothesize probabilities for the likelihoods:
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.9 \quad \text{and} \quad P(D|H) = 0.1
   \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
\]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:
\[
\text{Numerator} = 0.9 \times 0.75 = 0.675
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.964"\}}
\]
