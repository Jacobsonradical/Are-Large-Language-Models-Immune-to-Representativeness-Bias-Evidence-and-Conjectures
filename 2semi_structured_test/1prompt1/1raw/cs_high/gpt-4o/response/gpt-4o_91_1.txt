To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing the description among all professors.

Let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   - The sample includes 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) that any given professor is from computer science is:
   
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   - Given the description of Jason (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's very likely that he is a computer science professor. Let's assume this likelihood is high.
   - For simplicity, let's assign \( P(B|A) \) a high value, such as 0.95.
   
3. **Likelihood \( P(B|¬A) \)**:
   - Given the description of Jason, the likelihood that he is from the humanities department would be relatively low. Let's assume this likelihood is low.
   - For simplicity, let's assign \( P(B|¬A) \), a low value, such as 0.05.
   
4. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   - The overall likelihood of observing someone like Jason regardless of department is a weighted average of the likelihoods.
   
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A)
   \]
   
   \( P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \)
   
   \[
   P(B) = (0.95 \cdot 0.75) + (0.05 \cdot 0.25) = 0.7125 + 0.0125 = 0.725
   \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} = \frac{0.7125}{0.725} ≈ 0.9828
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.9828"}
\]
