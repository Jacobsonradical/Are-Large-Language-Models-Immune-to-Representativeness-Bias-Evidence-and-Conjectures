Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more aligned with computer science than the humanities, it is reasonable to increase the probability of him being a computer science professor. We need to weigh this against the base rate of computer science professors in the sample. 

The base rate (prior probability) that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

The base rate that a randomly chosen person from the sample is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, without exact likelihood values for how likely computer science and humanities professors are to fit Jason's description, we will make a qualitative judgment:

- Jason's coding and mathematical problem-solving activities significantly increase the likelihood that he is a computer science professor.
- Jason's disinterest in activities such as drawing or writing might also slightly decrease the likelihood that he is a humanities professor.

Therefore, combining the prior information with the provided details, it's reasonable to assume a high probability leaning towards computer science. 

Given this qualitative assessment:
\[ \text{"probability"}: "0.95" \]

This reflects a strong leaning towards the computer science field even if not mathematically rigorous:
