To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Specifically, we want to find P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- CS: Jason is a Computer Science professor
- HUM: Jason is a Humanities professor
- D: The given description fits Jason

We are interested in finding P(CS | D). By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- P(D | CS) is the probability of the description given Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- P(CS) is the prior probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- P(D) is the total probability of the description.

First, compute the priors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assume P(D | CS) and P(D | HUM) based on Jason's specific description traits. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely traits of a Computer Science professor than a Humanities professor, we might estimate these conditional probabilities as follows:

- P(D | CS) is reasonably high since his interests align closely with computer science.
- P(D | HUM) is reasonably low since his interests are not typical of a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | HUM) = 0.1 \]

Using the law of total probability, we find P(D):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Using the required format:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
