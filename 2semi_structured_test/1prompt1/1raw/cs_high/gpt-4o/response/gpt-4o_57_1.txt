First, let's outline the information we have:

1. There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
2. Jason's interests include coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more commonly associated with computer science.
3. Despite his creativity, Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more associated with the humanities.

Now let's apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason’s description occurring in the entire pool.

Given:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor = 75/100 = 0.75.
- \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor = 25/100 = 0.25.

To get \( P(B) \), calculate the weighted likelihood:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Assuming Jason's description fits well with a computer science professor, let’s denote \( P(B|A) \approx 1 \). For a humanities professor \( P(B|\neg A) \) would be considerably less since his interests do not align well with humanities, let’s conservatively assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

Using these assumptions:
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.025 = 0.775 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \approx 0.967 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:

\[ {"probability": "0.967"} \]
