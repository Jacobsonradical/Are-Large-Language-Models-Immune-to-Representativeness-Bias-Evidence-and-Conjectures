To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps in finding the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason we have been given.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given the information in the problem:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we need to figure out \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of the description given the two possible categories. Since the description fits the typical profile of someone in computer science more closely (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles), we might assume that this kind of description is more likely to appear for a computer science professor than for a humanities professor. Therefore, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (It's highly probable that the description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (It's less probable that the description fits a humanities professor)

Now, we can find \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is roughly 0.9643.
