To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description occurring.

Given:
- 75 computer science professors (\( N_{CS} = 75 \))
- 25 humanities professors (\( N_{H} = 25 \))
- The total number of professors is 100.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to assess \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \):
- Jason's description fits better with a computer science professor based on the given traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.).
- To simplify, we can reasonably assume that the probability of someone fitting Jason's description is higher among computer science professors than among humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assign reasonable estimates for those probabilities:
\[ P(B|CS) = 0.8 \] (high probability since Jason's traits are typical for a computer science professor)
\[ P(B|H) = 0.1 \] (low probability since Jason's description is not typical for a humanities professor)

Finally, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \) by adding up the weighted likelihoods:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.625 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = 0.96 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
