To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us revise existing predictions or theories (i.e., prior probabilities) with new evidence or information (i.e., likelihoods).

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors = 75 + 25 = 100.
- Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Next, we need to assess the likelihood of the description given whether Jason is a computer science professor or humanities professor, \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \).

The given description about Jason shows a strong inclination towards activities that are generally more associated with computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and less with humanities (not enjoying drawing or writing).

We'll make some educated guesses:
- The likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor, \( P(\text{description} | C) \), is relatively high. Let’s say \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.9 \).
- The likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor, \( P(\text{description} | H) \), is relatively low. Let’s say \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1 \).

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
