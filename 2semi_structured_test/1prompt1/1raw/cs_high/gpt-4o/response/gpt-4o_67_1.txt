Given that there were 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors interviewed in this study, we can initially compute the base rate (prior probability) of Jason being a computer science professor, which is 75 out of 100, or 0.75.

Next, we need to consider how well Jasonâ€™s description corresponds to the profiles typical of computer science professors versus those of humanities professors. Given the description, Jason seems to exhibit traits and interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which align more closely with computer science.

Without specific statistical data about how likely such traits are to appear in computer science versus humanities professors, we use our prior information combined with the logical inference that these traits are indeed more plausible for a computer science professor.

Therefore, taking both the base rate and the description into account, it seems reasonably plausible that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

So, we will compute:
- Base rate likelihood that Jason is from computer science: 0.75

Given the description leans heavily towards computer science traits, we can adjust our probability slightly higher to reflect this stronger alignment.
