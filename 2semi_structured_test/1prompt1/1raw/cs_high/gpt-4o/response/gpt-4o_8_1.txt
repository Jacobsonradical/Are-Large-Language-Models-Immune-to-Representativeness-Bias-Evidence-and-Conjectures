To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \(C_s\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Given the description \(D\), the probability we seek is \(P(C_s | D)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(D)} \]

We need to compute each component of this formula:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(C_s)\) and \(P(H)\)**:
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is in computer science: \(P(C_s) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
   - Probability that a randomly selected professor is in humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).

2. **Likelihoods \(P(D | C_s)\) and \(P(D | H)\)**:
   - Probability of Jason’s description given he is in computer science (\(P(D | C_s)\)).
   - Probability of Jason’s description given he is in humanities (\(P(D | H)\)).

Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative, does not enjoy drawing or writing):
   - It is relatively more likely for someone with Jason's profile to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Although we do not have exact values for these likelihoods, we can use qualitative reasoning:
   - Suppose \(P(D | C_s)\) is considerably higher than \(P(D | H)\). For instance, let's assume \(P(D | C_s) = 0.9\) and \(P(D | H) = 0.1\) as reasonable approximations based on the description.

3. **Overall probability of the description \(P(D)\)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{P(D | C_s) \cdot P(C_s)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C_s | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C_s | D) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
