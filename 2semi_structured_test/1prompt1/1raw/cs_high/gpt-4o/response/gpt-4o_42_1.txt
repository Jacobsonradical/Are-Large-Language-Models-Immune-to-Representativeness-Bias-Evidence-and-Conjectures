To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We want \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science = 75/100 = 0.75
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need estimates for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the given description, it seems more aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor than a humanities professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging).

Suppose the probability of such a description for a computer science professor \( P(D|C) \) is high. For estimation, let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \).

Suppose the probability of such a description for a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \) is low. For estimation, let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Finally, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.9643.

So, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.9643"}
