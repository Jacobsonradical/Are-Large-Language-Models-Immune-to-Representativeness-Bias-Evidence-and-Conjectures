Let's use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

First, we define our events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason's description as given.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We break this down step-by-step:

**1. Determine \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):**

Since we have 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

**2. Estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):**

Since Jason's description includes his interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and his lack of enjoyment in drawing or writing, it is more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

**3. Compute \( P(D) \):**

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

**4. Compute \( P(CS|D) \):**

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.9643"}
```
