To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

In this case, we are trying to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, letâ€™s define the terms:
- \( P(CS) \) = the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) = the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \) = the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) = the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \) = the probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.

Thus:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assume for the sake of simplicity (which is often done in the absence of detailed data):
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.1 \]

(These values are hypothetical and represent the assumed likelihood of the description for each group. Adjust based on more specific data if available.)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.625 \]

Finally, compute \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.75)}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.625} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.96 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.96"}
