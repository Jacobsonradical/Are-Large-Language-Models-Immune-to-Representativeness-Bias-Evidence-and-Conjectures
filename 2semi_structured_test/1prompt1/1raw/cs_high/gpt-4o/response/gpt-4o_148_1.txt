In order to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we can use Bayes’ Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description matches Jason.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors, \(n_{cs}\) = 75
- Number of humanities professors, \(n_{hum}\) = 25  

We want to calculate \(P(A|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. According to Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

We start by assigning prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) 
- \( P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We also need \(P(D|A)\) (the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor) and \(P(D|B)\) (the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor). Given the details in the description, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor because of his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. For simplicity, let's assume reasonable estimates:
- \( P(D|A) \approx 0.9 \) 
- \( P(D|B) \approx 0.1 \) 

Finally, the total probability of the description \(P(D)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
