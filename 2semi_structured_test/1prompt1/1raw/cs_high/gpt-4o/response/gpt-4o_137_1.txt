To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's enumerate some basic quantities:

- The total number of professors is 100 (75 in computer science and 25 in the humanities).
- We'll denote:
  - \( P(CS) \): the probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
  - \( P(Hum) \): the probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
  
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where \( D \) is Jason's description. To compute this, we need:
1. \( P(D|CS) \): the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D|Hum) \): the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D) \): the overall probability of the description \( D \).

Assumptions need to be made about how typical Jason's description is for each discipline:
- Given Jason's interests (coding, mathematical puzzles) and traits (conservative, careful, ambitious), it is highly likely that he is a computer science professor.
- It is less likely for a humanities professor to have such a description.

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \] (high likelihood given the specific interests and traits)
\[ P(D|Hum) = 0.1 \] (low likelihood, not many humanities professors enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles)

Now, compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, putting it all together:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
