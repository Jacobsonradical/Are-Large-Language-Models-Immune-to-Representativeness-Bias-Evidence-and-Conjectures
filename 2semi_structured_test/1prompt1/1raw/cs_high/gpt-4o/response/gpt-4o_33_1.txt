To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We start with defining the relevant terms:

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
  
Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, let \( T \) denote the event described by the description of Jason. We need to find \( P(C|T) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{P(T|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(T)} \]

We assume that Jason's description fits the profile of computer science professors more likely than humanities professors, given his interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing or writing, etc.

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume the following approximations:
- \( P(T|C) = 0.9 \) (since the description seems strongly aligned with a computer science profile)
- \( P(T|H) = 0.1 \) (since the description does not closely match a typical humanities profile)

We now calculate the total probability \( P(T) \):
\[ P(T) = P(T|C) \cdot P(C) + P(T|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(T) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.7 \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|T) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.964.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
