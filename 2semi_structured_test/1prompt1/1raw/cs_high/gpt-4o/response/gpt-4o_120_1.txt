To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let’s define our hypotheses:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor

We need to find \( P(H_{CS} | D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]

Now, let’s break this down step-by-step.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, \( P(H_{CS}) \): 
   There are 75 CS professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(H_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

   - The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, \( P(H_{H}) \):
   There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   \[ P(H_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D | H_{CS}) \):
   Since the traits described (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, being conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious) are more stereotypically associated with a computer science professor as opposed to a humanities professor, let’s assume this likelihood is high. For the sake of this calculation, let's approximate:
   \[ P(D | H_{CS}) \approx 0.9 \]
   
   - The likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D | H_{H}) \):
   These traits are less associated with a humanities professor. Let’s approximate this as being lower:
   \[ P(D | H_{H}) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Total probability of the description \( P(D) \):**
   This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H}) \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

4. **Posterior probability:**
   Finally, using Bayes’ theorem:
   \[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
   \[ P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
   \[ P(H_{CS} | D) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.931"}
