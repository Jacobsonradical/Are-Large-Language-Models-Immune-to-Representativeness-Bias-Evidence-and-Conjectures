To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( HU \): Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): The description of Jason

We seek \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to find \( P(D | CS) \), \( P(CS) \), and \( P(D) \):

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(CS) \) and \( P(HU) \)):**

   - \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(HU) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods (\( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | HU) \)):**

   - \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D | HU) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   
   Based on Jasonâ€™s description, it matches more with typical traits and interests of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Let's assume that:
   
   - \( P(D | CS) \) is high, say 0.9 (high likelihood that a computer science professor has Jason's description)
   - \( P(D | HU) \) is low, say 0.1 (low likelihood that a humanities professor has Jason's description)

3. **Total Probability (\( P(D) \)):**

   - \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | HU) \cdot P(HU) \)
   - \( P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \)
   - \( P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \)

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
