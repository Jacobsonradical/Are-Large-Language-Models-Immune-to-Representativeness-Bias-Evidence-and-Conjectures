To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

First, we find each component:

1. **Prior probability \( P(C) \)**: This is the probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.

Since there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, the total number of professors is 100.

\[
P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

2. **Likelihood \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \)**: These are the probabilities of Jason's description given that he's a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

Based on Jason's attributes (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it seems much more likely that he fits the profile of a computer science professor. However, without exact numbers, we can estimate these probabilities intuitively:

Let's assume:
\[
P(\text{description} | C) = 0.9
\]
\[
P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1
\]

3. **Marginal likelihood \( P(\text{description}) \)**: This is the total probability of the description, which we can find using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C)P(C) + P(\text{description} | H)P(H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25)
\]

\[
P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7}
\]

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.9643"\}}
\]
