To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(E\): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|C) \) is the probability of observing the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of observing the description.

First, assign the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \(P(E|C)\) and \(P(E|H)\). Since the description ("enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging") suggests traits more common to computer science professors, let's assume:
\[ P(E|C) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(E|H) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, we can find \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|C) \cdot P(C) + P(E|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.65 \]

Therefore, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(C|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|E) \approx \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(C|E) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
\[ {"probability": "0.923"} \]
