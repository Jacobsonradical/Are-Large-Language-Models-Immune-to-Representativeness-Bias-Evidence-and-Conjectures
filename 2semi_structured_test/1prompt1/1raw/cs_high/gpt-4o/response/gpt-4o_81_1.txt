To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 100 descriptions in total: 75 from computer science professors and 25 from humanities professors.
- We want to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description.

Let's define the relevant events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description, which can be found using the law of total probability: 
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we don't have the exact probabilities \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can estimate them based on the description. Jasonâ€™s interests and traits, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, seem more aligned with the profile of a computer science professor. Therefore, we can assume \( P(D|C) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \).

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood because the description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood because the description does not strongly fit a humanities professor)

Now we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
