To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is expressed as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description among all academics.

Let's define the events:
- Let \( A_{\text{CS}} \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( A_{\text{Hum}} \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the setup:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(A_{\text{CS}}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
  \[ P(A_{\text{Hum}}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We assume that the description fits computer science professors more closely, due to the nature of activities Jason enjoys (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Therefore, a reasonable assumption (given typical characterization stereotypes) could be:

- \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor) is higher than 
- \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor).

However, without specific values for \( P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \) and \( P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \), we can make a reasoned hypothesis based on likelihood alone.

Let's make a reasonable and subjective estimation where:
\[ P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}}) + P(B|A_{\text{Hum}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{Hum}}) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{\text{CS}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{CS}})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) = \frac{60}{65} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{CS}}|B) \approx 0.923 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.923.

So, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.923"}
