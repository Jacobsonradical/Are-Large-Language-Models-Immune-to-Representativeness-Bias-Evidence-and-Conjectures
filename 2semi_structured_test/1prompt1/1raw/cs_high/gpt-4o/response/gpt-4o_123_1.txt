To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description fits Jason (the observed details).

We are looking to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

To simplify, let's break it down with the given data:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   Based on the description, Jason appears to have traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles). We assume that:
   \[ P(D|C) \] is relatively high, let's approximate it as \( 0.9 \).
   \[ P(D|H) \] is relatively low, let's approximate it as \( 0.2 \).

3. **Total Probability of Description \( D \)**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.93 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.93.
