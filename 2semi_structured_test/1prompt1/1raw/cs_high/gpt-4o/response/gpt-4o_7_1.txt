To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

We are given:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

We need to find \(P(C \mid \text{Description})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

\[ P(H \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since \(P(\text{Description})\) is common to both, we can simplify their ratio:

\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are activities more commonly associated with computer science professors than humanities professors, we can make a reasonable assumption that \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) > P(\text{Description} \mid H)\).

For simplicity, if we assume \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) = k \cdot P(\text{Description} \mid H)\), where \(k > 1\), then:

\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = \frac{k \cdot P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)} = k \cdot \frac{P(C)}{P(H)} \]

\[ \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{P(H \mid \text{Description})} = k \cdot \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3k \]

Given that the probabilities must sum to 1:

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) + P(H \mid \text{Description}) = 1 \]

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) + \frac{P(C \mid \text{Description})}{3k} = 1 \]

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) \left(1 + \frac{1}{3k}\right) = 1 \]

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{3k}} \]

Assuming \(k\) is reasonably large, stating that \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) = 3 \cdot P(\text{Description} \mid H)\):

\[ P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{9}} = \frac{1}{1.111} \approx 0.9 \]

Thus, given the assumption and the description, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is high.
