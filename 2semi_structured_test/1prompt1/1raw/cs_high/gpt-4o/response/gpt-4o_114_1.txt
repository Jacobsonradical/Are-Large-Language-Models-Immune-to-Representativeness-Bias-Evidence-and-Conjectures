To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Prior Probability (Base Rate)**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess how likely the given description (D) is for both groups (computer science and humanities).

Assumptions based on typical profiles:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which is more likely among computer science professors.
- Jason enjoys jogging, which could be common in both fields.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which is more likely among computer science professors.

Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Let's assign the likelihoods based on this reasoning:
   - P(D|CS): Probability of description given professor is in computer science = 0.9 (90%)
   - P(D|H): Probability of description given professor is in humanities = 0.1 (10%)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayesâ€™ Theorem**:
Using Bayes' theorem,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.964285714 \]

Rounding to three decimal places, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964, or 96.4%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
