To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem.

Here's how we proceed:

1. **Prior probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is from the humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
   - The likelihood that Jason's description fits a humanities professor, \( P(D|Hum) \).

Given the description of Jason, which does fit characteristics that one might typically associate with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.), we can hypothesize that \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than \( P(D|Hum) \). Let's assume that:
   - \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.90 \) (high likelihood Jason is from CS based on the description).
   - \( P(D|Hum) \approx 0.10 \) (low likelihood Jason is from Humanities based on the description).

3. **Posterior probability:**
We apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Let's calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.90 \times 0.75) + (0.10 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.70 \]

Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.90 \times 0.75}{0.70} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Here is the probability in the requested format:
