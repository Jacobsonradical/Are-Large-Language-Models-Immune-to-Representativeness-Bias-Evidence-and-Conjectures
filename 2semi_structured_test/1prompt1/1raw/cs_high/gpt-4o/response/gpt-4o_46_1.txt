To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know the following:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (prior probability of being a computer science professor).
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (prior probability of being a humanities professor).

We need to compute \(P(C \mid \text{description})\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

The denominator \(P(\text{description})\) is the total probability of getting this description. It can be broken down as:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming that the description given is more likely to describe a computer science professor (based on the enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), we assign:
- \(P(\text{description} \mid C) = 0.9\) (high likelihood of a CS professor fitting the description).
- \(P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood of a humanities professor fitting the description).

Now we can calculate \(P(\text{description})\):
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Next, we calculate \(P(C \mid \text{description})\):
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid \text{description}) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
