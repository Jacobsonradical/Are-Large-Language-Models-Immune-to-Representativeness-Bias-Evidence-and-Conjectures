To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, we need to define the relevant probabilities.

1. **Prior Probability**: The prior probabilities are given by the proportions of computer science and humanities professors in the sample.
   
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

2. **Likelihood**: These are the probabilities of seeing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Since we don't have exact likelihoods, we rely on typical characteristics:
   
   - Let's assume P(description | CS) is higher because Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are closely related to the computer science discipline.
   
   - Considering the attributes stated, let's assume that such a description is 0.8 for computer science professors.

   - Conversely, the likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description (P(description | H)) might be lower, say 0.2.
   
3. **Posterior Probability**: We need to find P(CS | description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. This can be computed using Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   We need the overall probability of the description (P(description)), which can be computed using the law of total probability:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65
   \]

   Now compute the posterior probability:

   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.923.
