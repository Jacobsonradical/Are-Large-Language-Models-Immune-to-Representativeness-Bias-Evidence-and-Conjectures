To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior probability of being in each group:**
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - Thus, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75.
   - The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities (P(Hum)) = 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Likelihood of the given description fitting a computer science professor (P(Description | CS)) vs. a humanities professor (P(Description | Hum)):**
   - The description fits stereotypes more common among computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles).
   - Let's assume that such a description is more typical for computer science professors. For the sake of example, let's assign:
     - P(Description | CS) = 0.9 (high likelihood given the traits listed).
     - P(Description | Hum) = 0.1 (low likelihood given the traits listed).

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Bayes' theorem formula: 
     \( P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)} \)

   - First compute the total probability of the description (P(Description)):
     \( P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \)
     \( P(Description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \)
     \( P(Description) = 0.675 + 0.025 \)
     \( P(Description) = 0.7 \)

   - Now compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (P(CS | Description)):
     \( P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \)
     \( P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \)
     \( P(CS | Description) \approx 0.964 \)

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
