To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. The relevant probabilities and information are as follows:

1. There are 75 computer science professors (CS professors) and 25 humanities professors (H professors).
2. You are given a description of Jason that fits certain characteristics.

We need to compute \( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's description}) \), which represents the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason's description})} \]

However, we do not have explicit values for \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{H}) \). But, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the description of Jason:

1. Jason’s interests and traits—coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging—are much more stereotypical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.
2. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{H}) \).

Given that there are 75 CS professors and 25 H professors, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Assuming \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{CS}) \) is significantly higher than \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{H}) \), we can reasonably infer that Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor.

We do not have exact values for \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Jason's description} \mid \text{H}) \), but given the strong alignment with characteristics of CS professors, we'll make an educated guess that the probability is significantly higher for the computer science category.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability can be:

\[ \boxed{0.9} \]

So, the answer format would be:
{"probability": "0.9"}
