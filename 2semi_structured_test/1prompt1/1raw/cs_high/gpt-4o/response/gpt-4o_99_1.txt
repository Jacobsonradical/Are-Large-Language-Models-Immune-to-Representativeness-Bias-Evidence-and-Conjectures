To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. We want to find P(CS | Description), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

First, let's define the terms:
1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a random professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a random professor is from the humanities.
3. \( P(Description | CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(Description | Hum) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(Description) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \))
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \))

Now, let's make an educated guess about the likelihoods \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | Hum) \).

Jason's description:
- Enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.
- Talented, ambitious, and highly creative.
- Does not enjoy drawing or writing.

Given the interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it's much more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. Assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(Description | Hum) \approx 0.1 \)

Now we calculate \( P(Description) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
