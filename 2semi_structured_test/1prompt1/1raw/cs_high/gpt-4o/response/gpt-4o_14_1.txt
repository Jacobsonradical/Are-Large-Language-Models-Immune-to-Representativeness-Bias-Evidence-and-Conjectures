To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' theorem and consider the given probabilities and the traits described. 

1. **Prior Probability**: The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (CS) or humanities.
   - There are 75 CS professors and 25 humanities professors.
   - P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
   - P(Humanities) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

2. **Likelihood Based on Description**:
   - Without specific likelihood values for descriptions fitting CS or humanities professors, we'll assume that Jason's characteristics (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) are much more common among CS professors than humanities professors.

Given the assumptions that these traits are indicative of a CS professor:

- P(Description | CS) is fairly high. Let's assume for the sake of this demonstration, P(Description | CS) = 0.9.
- P(Description | Humanities) is quite low. Let's assume, P(Description | Humanities) = 0.1.

3. **Posterior Probability**: The probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.
   - Use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

Firstly, compute \( P(Description) \):
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Humanities) \times P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.7 \]

Now, compute the posterior probability:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | Description) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
