To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the Events**:
   Let \(C\) be the event that the professor is from the Computer Science (CS) group.
   Let \(H\) be the event that the professor is from the Humanities (H) group.
   And let \(P\) be the event that the professor has Jason's profile.

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability that the professor is from CS, \(P(C)\): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability that the professor is from H, \(P(H)\): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. **Probability of Jason's Profile Given the Groups**:
   We need to estimate these.
   - Probability of Jason's profile given the professor is from CS, \(P(P|C)\).
   - Probability of Jason's profile given the professor is from H, \(P(P|H)\).

   From the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with CS. Estimating these values as:
   - \(P(P|C)\) is likely high, say close to 1 (let's assume 0.9 for example).
   - \(P(P|H)\) might be much lower because his interests align less with typical humanities (letâ€™s assume 0.1 for example).

4. **Total Probability of Jason's Profile**:
   By the law of total probability:
   \(P(P) = P(P|C)P(C) + P(P|H)P(H)\)
   \(P(P) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25)\)
   \(P(P) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.70\)

5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   To find: \(P(C|P) = \frac{P(P|C)P(C)}{P(P)}\)

   Substitute the values:
   \(P(C|P) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.70} = \frac{0.675}{0.70} \approx 0.964\)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
