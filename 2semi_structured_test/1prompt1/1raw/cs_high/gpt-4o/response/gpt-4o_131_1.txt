To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The theorem gives a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define our events:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = The description provided matches Jason.

We want to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's start with \( P(A) \):
- The number of computer science professors is 75.
- The total number of professors is 100.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(B|A) \):
- Given the description, it's more likely that Jason's interests and traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) match those of computer science professors. It is reasonable to assume this probability is relatively high. For estimation, let’s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).

Next, we calculate \( P(B) \):
- Jason can either be a computer science professor or a humanities professor.
- To find \( P(B) \), we need to use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

For the probability \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- Given the description, it’s less likely that it matches a humanities professor's typical interests and traits. For estimation, let’s assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Now, we compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is roughly 0.931.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.931"}
