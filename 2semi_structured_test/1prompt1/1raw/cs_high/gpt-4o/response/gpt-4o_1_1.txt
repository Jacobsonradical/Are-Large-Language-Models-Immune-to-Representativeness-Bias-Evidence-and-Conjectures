To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem formula in this context:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the overall probability of getting the description.

Let's break down the components:

1. \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science. Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from humanities:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. We need to make an educated guess about \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \). Given Jason's interests (coding and solving mathematical puzzles), it seems more characteristic of a computer science professor. While it's not stated exactly how probable these interests are for either group, letâ€™s assume:
\[ P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, use the law of total probability to find \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) * P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.964 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
