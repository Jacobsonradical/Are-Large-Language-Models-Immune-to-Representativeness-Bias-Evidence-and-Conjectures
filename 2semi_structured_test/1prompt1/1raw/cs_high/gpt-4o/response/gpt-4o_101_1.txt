To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on the given description, we need to consider both the base rates (prior probabilities) and the likelihood of the description fitting either type of professor. This can be approached using Bayes' theorem.

The given problem involves:
- 75 computer science professors (CS)
- 25 humanities professors (H)

So, the prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 75 / 100 = 0.75
- P(H) = 25 / 100 = 0.25

Next, we need to evaluate how likely Jason's description is if he were a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Let's denote:
- P(description | CS) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- P(description | H) as the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Suppose that the description of enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, combined with the lack of interest in drawing or writing, suggests a stronger fit for a CS professor than a humanities professor. Without specific numbers, let's assign:
- P(description | CS) = 0.9 (since it aligns well with typical computer science interests)
- P(description | H) = 0.2 (since it doesn't align much with typical humanities interests)

We apply Bayes' theorem to find P(CS | description):

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | H) \times P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.2 \times 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.05} \]

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]

\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.930 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.93.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.93"}
