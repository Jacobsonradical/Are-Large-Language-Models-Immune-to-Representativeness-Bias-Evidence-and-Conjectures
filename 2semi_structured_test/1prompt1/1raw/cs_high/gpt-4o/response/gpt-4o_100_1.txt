To solve this problem effectively, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define our events:
- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to compute \( \Pr(C \mid E) \) where \( E \) is the evidence provided by Jason's description.

### Step 1: Establish Prior Probabilities
We know the baseline probabilities:
- \( \Pr(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( \Pr(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

### Step 2: Compute the Likelihoods
Next, estimate how likely Jasonâ€™s traits (conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, likes coding, etc.) are in each group.

It's reasonable to assume that enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are traits more common among computer science professors than humanities professors. Therefore, let's denote:
- \( \Pr(E \mid C) \equiv P_1 \)
- \( \Pr(E \mid H) \equiv P_2 \)

Without definitive data, we'll assume:
- \( \Pr(E \mid C) \) is significantly higher than \( \Pr(E \mid H) \). For the sake of computation, let's consider \( \Pr(E \mid C) = 0.9 \) and \( \Pr(E \mid H) = 0.1 \).

### Step 3: Compute the Posterior Probability
Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
\Pr(C \mid E) = \frac{\Pr(E \mid C) \Pr(C)}{\Pr(E \mid C) \Pr(C) + \Pr(E \mid H) \Pr(H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\Pr(C \mid E) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.9 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25}
\]

\[
\Pr(C \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]

\[
\Pr(C \mid E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]

\[
\Pr(C \mid E) \approx 0.9643
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{0.9643}
\]

Formatted as required:

\[
{"probability": "0.9643"}
\]
