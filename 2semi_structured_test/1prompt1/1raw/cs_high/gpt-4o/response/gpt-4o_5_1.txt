To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( A = \text{Jason is a computer science professor} \)
- \( B = \text{Jason's description} \)

Now, let's identify the given probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors in total.

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

- \( P(\neg A) \): This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors in total.

\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems reasonable to assume that such a description is more likely for a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Since the description doesn't align as well with typical activities of a humanities professor, let's assume:

\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
