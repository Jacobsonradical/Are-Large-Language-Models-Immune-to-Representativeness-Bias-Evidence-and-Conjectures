To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

First, let’s define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description applies to Jason.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Prior probability (before considering the description) that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

We need to calculate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description, \( P(C|D) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

The overall probability of the description, \( P(D) \), can be computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we don't have specific probabilities for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can make a reasonable assumption based on the given description. The description of enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing fits more closely with the typical profile of a computer science professor. Thus, let's reasonably assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

Now we can compute:
- \( P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \)

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
