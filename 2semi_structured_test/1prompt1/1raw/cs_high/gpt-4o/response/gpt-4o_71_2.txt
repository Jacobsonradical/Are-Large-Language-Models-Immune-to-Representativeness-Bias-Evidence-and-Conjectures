We can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Let's define the following events:
- \(A_{CS}\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(A_{H}\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(B\): The given description of Jason.

We want to compute \(P(A_{CS} | B)\): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(B\).

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

We also need the following probabilities:
- \(P(A_{CS})\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A_{H})\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(B | A_{CS})\): The probability of the description \(B\) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B | A_{H})\): The probability of the description \(B\) given that Jason is a humanities professor.

First, let's define the prior probabilities:
- \(P(A_{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \(P(A_{H}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, we need to estimate \(P(B | A_{CS})\) and \(P(B | A_{H})\).

Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason would fit the profile of a computer science professor. He enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are common interests among computer science professors.

Let's assume:
- \(P(B | A_{CS}) = 0.9\)
- \(P(B | A_{H}) = 0.1\)

Now, we can compute \(P(B)\) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B | A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H}) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \(P(A_{CS} | B)\):

\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A_{CS} | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(A_{CS} | B) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.964\).

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.964"}
