To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- **P(CS)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- **P(H)**: The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- **P(D | CS)**: The probability of getting Jason's description given that the professor is in computer science.
- **P(D | H)**: The probability of getting Jason's description given that the professor is in the humanities.
- **P(D)**: The probability of getting Jason's description overall.
- **P(CS | D)**: The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (this is what we are solving for).

From the problem, we know that:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, **P(CS) = 75 / (75 + 25) = 0.75** and **P(H) = 25 / (75 + 25) = 0.25**.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

We need to estimate **P(D | CS)** and **P(D | H)**:
Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it appears more likely that he is a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. Assuming these traits are significantly more common in computer science professors, we might estimate:
- **P(D | CS) ≈ 0.8** (since the description fits a typical computer science professor quite well)
- **P(D | H) ≈ 0.2** (since the description fits a typical humanities professor less well)

Now we can calculate **P(D)**:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.65 \]

Finally, we calculate **P(CS | D)**:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) ≈ \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(CS | D) ≈ 0.923 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately **0.923**.
