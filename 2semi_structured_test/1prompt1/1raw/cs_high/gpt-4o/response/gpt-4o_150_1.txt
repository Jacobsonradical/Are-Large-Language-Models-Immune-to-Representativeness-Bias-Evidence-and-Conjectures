First, let us restate the given information:

- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- We need to assess the probability that Jason, whose description is provided, is a computer science professor.

Given the descriptions in Jason's profile (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing), these traits are more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we also need to consider the base rates of the two groups.

Let \( P(A) \) represent the probability that a randomly selected description is of a computer science professor, which is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

And let \( P(B) \) represent the probability that a randomly selected description is of a humanities professor, which is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Let the description matching Jason's profile be denoted as event \( E \). We need the probability \( P(A|E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( E \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
- \( P(E|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|B) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Assuming the description especially matches the profile of a computer science professor (although an exact value should ideally be derived from empirical data, we shall use a strong heuristic assumption such as \( P(E|A) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(E|B) \approx 0.1 \) given the difference in relevance of the activities described to each field):

\[ P(E) = P(E|A) \cdot P(A) + P(E|B) \cdot P(B) \] 

Substitute values:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \] 
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 \] 
\[ P(E) = 0.7 \] 

Now compute \( P(A|E) \):
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \] 
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \] 
\[ P(A|E) \approx 0.964 \] 

Therefore, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his profile is approximately 0.964.
