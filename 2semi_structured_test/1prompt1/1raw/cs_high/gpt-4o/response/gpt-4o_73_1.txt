To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

The probability we are looking for is \( P(CS | D) \), where \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( D \) is the given description of Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given Jason's description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not in drawing or writing), it is likely to be more common among computer science professors. For simplicity, let's assume:

\[ P(D | CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | H) = 0.1 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.964"}\} \]
