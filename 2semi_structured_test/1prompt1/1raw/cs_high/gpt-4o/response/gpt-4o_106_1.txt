To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate the probability given his description. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

From the problem statement:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

Now, we need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Based on Jason's preferences and the description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing), it appears more likely to be a computer science professor. While we don't have exact probabilities, we can infer the likelihood qualitatively based on the description.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is high, say 0.9 (90% likelihood that a computer science professor fits Jason's description).
- \( P(D|H) \) is low, say 0.1 (10% likelihood that a humanities professor fits Jason's description).

Now we apply Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643. So, our answer will be:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
