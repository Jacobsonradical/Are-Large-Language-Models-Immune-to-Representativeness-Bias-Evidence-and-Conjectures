To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the formal solution step by step:

1. **Define the events:**
    - \(E\): The professor is in computer science.
    - \(F\): The professor is in the humanities.

2. **Given numbers:**
    - \(P(E) = 75/100 = 0.75\): The prior probability of a professor being from computer science.
    - \(P(F) = 25/100 = 0.25\): The prior probability of a professor being from the humanities.

3. **Consider the description of Jason and the likelihoods:**
    - \(P(D|E)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
    - \(P(D|F)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

4. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, traits that align more with computer scientists, we can reasonably assume that \(P(D|E)\) is higher than \(P(D|F)\). However, without exact values, we can't be precise, but we can make an educated guess or estimate based on the given traits.

5. **Estimate likelihoods:**
    - \(P(D|E)\) could be quite high because coding and mathematical puzzles are directly relevant to computer science.
    - \(P(D|F)\) would be lower because these traits are less common in the humanities.

6. For simplicity, let's assume:
    - \(P(D|E) \approx 0.8\)
    - \(P(D|F) \approx 0.2\)

7. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
    \[
    P(E|D) = \frac{P(D|E) \cdot P(E)}{P(D|E) \cdot P(E) + P(D|F) \cdot P(F)}
    \]

8. **Calculate the numerator and denominator:**
    - Numerator: \(P(D|E) \cdot P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 = 0.6\)
    - Denominator: \(0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.05 = 0.65\)

9. **Compute the probability:**
    \[
    P(E|D) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
    \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.923.
