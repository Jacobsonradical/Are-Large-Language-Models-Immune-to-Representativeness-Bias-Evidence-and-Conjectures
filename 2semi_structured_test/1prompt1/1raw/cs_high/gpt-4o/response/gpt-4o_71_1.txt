To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random variables and can be used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) as the probability of the description given that the professor is from humanities.
- \( P(CS \mid D) \) as the posterior probability that the professor is from computer science given the description.

We need to calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \).

Given data:
- Total professors in the study: 100
- Number of computer science professors: 75
- Number of humanities professors: 25

Prior probabilities:
\[
P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Since we don't have exact values for these probabilities, we must make an educated guess based on the description.

Given the description, Jason seems to have a profile more in line with the interests and traits commonly associated with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Therefore, we would assume that:
\[
P(D \mid CS) \approx 0.9
\]
\[
P(D \mid H) \approx 0.1
\]

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[
P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substitute the values and solve:
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now calculate the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9642857
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: { "0.96" }
\]
