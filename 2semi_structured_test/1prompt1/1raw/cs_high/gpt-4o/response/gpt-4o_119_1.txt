To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we should apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jasonâ€™s description fits.

Firstly, let's define our prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)
- \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

Next, \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more stereotypical of a computer science professor. Thus, we can reasonably assume this probability is high, let's denote it as \( p \).

\( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. This description seems less typical for a humanities professor, so we can assume this probability is low, let's denote it as \( q \).

Without the exact values of \( p \) and \( q \), it's common to use the assumption that \( p \) is much higher than \( q \). For simplicity, let's assume \( p = 0.9 \) and \( q = 0.1 \).

Let's calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now applying to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.964"}
