This problem can be approached using Bayes' theorem. We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

To do this, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, we need to intuitively estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) based on the description of Jason, which indicates traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely associated with computer science professors than humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.9 \): There's a high chance that a computer science professor would fit Jason's description.
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \): There's a low chance that a humanities professor would fit Jason's description.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is:
\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
\]

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

So:
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
