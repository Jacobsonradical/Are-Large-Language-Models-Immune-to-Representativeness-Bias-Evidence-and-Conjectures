To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The problem involves a mixture of prior probabilities (base rates) and likelihoods of the given description.

The total number of professors is 100, with 75 in computer science (CS) and 25 in the humanities (H).

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor
- \(D\): Description of Jason

We aim to find: \(P(C|D)\), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (prior probability of CS professor)
- \(P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (prior probability of humanities professor)

We need to estimate the likelihoods:
- \(P(D|C)\): Probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor
- \(P(D|H)\): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor

From the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors, so we might consider \(P(D|C)\) significantly higher than \(P(D|H)\).

Let's assume reasonable estimates based on the description:
- \(P(D|C) = 0.9\) (high likelihood for CS due to the heavily CS-centric activities)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood for humanities, as the description predominantly fits a CS profile)

Next, calculate \(P(D)\) (total probability of the description):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
