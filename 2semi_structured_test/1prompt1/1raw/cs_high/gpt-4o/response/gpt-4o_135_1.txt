To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the initial probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of the description being observed.

First, let's work through each term:

1. **\(P(A)\)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors.
   So, \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **\(P(B|A)\)**: The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.

   The description includes qualities such as enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, which are highly indicative of a computer science professor. It's reasonable to assume that these characteristics are much more likely among computer science professors.
   
   While it's not given explicitly, let's assume a high probability. For the simplicity of the calculation, let's assume \(P(B|A) = 0.9\).

3. **\(P(B)\)**: The overall probability of the description.
   
   This is a bit trickier since we don't have exact numbers of how many humanities professors versus computer science professors fit the description. However, the description seems to fit a computer science professor far more closely than a humanities professor.
   
   Let's assume the likelihood of a humanities professor fitting this description is significantly lower, say \(P(B|¬A) = 0.1\) (where ¬A represents the event that Jason is a humanities professor). Since the prior probability of humanities professors is 0.25, we calculate \(P(B)\) using the law of total probability:

   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|¬A) \cdot P(¬A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.964.
