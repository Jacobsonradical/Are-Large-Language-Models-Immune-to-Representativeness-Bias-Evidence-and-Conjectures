To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, you can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the relevant events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason's description is as given.

We want to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of Jason's description.

First, we compute \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \):
- \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \): There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \): There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):

Given Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) and lack of interest in drawing or writing, it seems reasonable to assume that these characteristics are more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

- Assuming \( P(B|A) \), the likelihood that Jason's characteristics match that of computer science professors: Let’s estimate this to be high, say \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).
- Assuming \( P(B|\neg A) \), the likelihood that Jason's characteristics match that of humanities professors: Let’s estimate this to be low, say \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.931 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.931.
