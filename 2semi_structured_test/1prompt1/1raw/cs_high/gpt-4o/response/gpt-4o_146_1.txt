To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how the calculation typically works:

Let's define:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): Overall probability of the description.

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

where

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

First, let's compute \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \):
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's assess the probabilities of the description given the domains, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, itâ€™s reasonable to assume the description is more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. For the sake of estimation, let's assign approximate probabilities:
\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.9643 \).

Using the required format:
