Given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample, we can make use of Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his described traits.

Firstly, let's break down what we know:
- Total number of descriptions: \(100\)
- Number of computer science professors: \(75\)
- Number of humanities professors: \(25\)

To use Bayes' Theorem, we want to calculate \(P(A | B)\), where \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \(B\) is the event that Jason's description fits his traits.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given the information:
- \(P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science)
- \(P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities)

Now, for the traits fitting either group:
- Let \(P(B | A)\) be the probability of Jason's traits given he is a computer science professor.
- Let \(P(B | \neg A)\) be the probability of Jason's traits given he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, he appears to closely match the profile of a computer science professor. Without prior detailed empirical data from the personality test distributions for each group individually, we can subjectively estimate:
- \(P(B | A) \approx 0.9\) (high chance these traits appear in a computer science professor)
- \(P(B | \neg A) \approx 0.2\) (low chance these traits appear in a humanities professor)

Lastly, we need the total probability \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.05 = 0.725 \]

Now calculate \(P(A | B)\):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.725} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.93 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.93, or 93%.
