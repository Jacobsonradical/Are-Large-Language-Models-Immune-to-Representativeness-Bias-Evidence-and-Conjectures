To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Let's denote C as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let H be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

   From the provided data, we know:
   - There are 75 computer science professors.
   - There are 25 humanities professors.
   - P(C) = 75/100 = 0.75
   - P(H) = 25/100 = 0.25

2. **Determine the likelihoods:**
   We need to estimate the likelihoods of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Since Jason's liking for coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing are more characteristic of computer science professors, we could reasonably assume:

   - P(description | C) > P(description | H)

   For simplicity, suppose:
   - P(description | C) = 0.9 (i.e., 90% of the computer science professors fit the description)
   - P(description | H) = 0.1 (i.e., 10% of the humanities professors fit the description)

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   We'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(C | description):

   \[
   P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is given by the law of total probability:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Substituting the numbers:

   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = 0.675 + 0.025
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = 0.7
   \]

   Now, compute \( P(C | \text{description}) \):

   \[
   P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
   \]
   \[
   P(C | \text{description}) = 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
