To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(CS\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) be the observed description of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Calculating the priors:
- There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Now, let's assume the likelihoods based on the description. Given Jason's interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it seems more likely he is a computer science professor than a humanities professor. We'll make a reasonable assumption to assign these probabilities:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood the description matches a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood the description matches a humanities professor)

Next, we calculate the total probability \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now we can compute \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Let's express this in the required format:
```json
{"probability": "0.9643"}
