To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- A be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- B be the event that the description given matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description B.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \):**
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science professors}}{\text{Total Number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) (Jason is a humanities professor):**
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total Number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
Here we determine how likely it is for the description B to fit a computer science professor. Based on Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles which are more common in computer science), we can assume a higher likelihood compared to the humanities professors. However, without specific numerical data, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
Similarly, we assess how likely it is for the description B to fit a humanities professor. Given the description fits more typical characteristics of a computer scientist, we can assume a lower likelihood:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

5. **Total probability \( P(B) \):**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now, by substituting values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.75)}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.964.

Here is the answer in the desired format:

{"probability": "0.964"}
