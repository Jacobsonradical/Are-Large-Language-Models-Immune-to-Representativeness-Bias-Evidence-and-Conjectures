To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

1. First, define the events:
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): The description of Jason.

2. We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

3. Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]

4. Calculate each component:
   - \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science.
     \[
     P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

   - \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Based on the description (coding, mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assume a higher likelihood for computer science professors.
     \[
     P(B|A) \approx 1 \quad (\text{assuming high likelihood since the traits fit well})
     \]

   - \( P(B|\neg A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor). This is likely much lower because the description fits less well with typical humanities interests.
     \[
     P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \quad (\text{assuming low likelihood})
     \]

   - \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities.
     \[
     P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

   - \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description (using the law of total probability):
     \[
     P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) 
     \]
     \[
     P(B) \approx (1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.75 + 0.025 = 0.775
     \]

5. Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} \approx \frac{0.75}{0.775} \approx 0.968
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.968.
