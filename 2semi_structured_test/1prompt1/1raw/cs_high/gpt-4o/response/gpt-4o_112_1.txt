To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the provided description of Jason.

Here's a breakdown of the values we need:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of Jason having such a description.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (CS) and 25 humanities professors (HM).
- Total number of professors, \( N = 100 \).

Initial probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(HM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We assume that the description of enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more likely among computer science professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(B|CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|HM) = 0.1 \)

Now we use Bayesâ€™ theorem. First, we compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|HM) \cdot P(HM) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Now apply to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {\text{"probability": "0.9643"}} ]
