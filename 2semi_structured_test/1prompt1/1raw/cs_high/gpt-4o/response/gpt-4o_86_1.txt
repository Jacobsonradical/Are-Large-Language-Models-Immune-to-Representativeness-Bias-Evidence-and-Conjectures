To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - Let \( D \) be the observed description of Jason.

2. **Calculate Priors:**
   - The prior probability of \( CS \), \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75.
   - The prior probability of \( H \), \( P(H) \) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25.

3. **Calculate Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor.

   Given Jason’s interests in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and a lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is much more likely for him to be a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, exact numerical values for these likelihoods are not given. We can represent them as follows:
   - \( P(D|CS) \) will be much higher than \( P(D|H) \).

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Let's make an assumption that \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (a high probability given the alignment) and \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (a low probability given the misalignment).

Then,
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Now compute \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = \approx 0.964 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.

Thus, the formatted answer should be:

{"probability": "0.964"}
