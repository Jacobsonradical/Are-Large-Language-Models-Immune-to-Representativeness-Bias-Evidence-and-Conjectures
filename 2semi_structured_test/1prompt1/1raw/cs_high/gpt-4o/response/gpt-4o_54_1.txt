To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine these probabilities:
1. Prior probability \( P(A) \):
   - There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. Prior probability \( P(A^c) \) (Jason is a humanities professor):
   - \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

3. Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Let's denote this as higher, considering his interests and traits align with computer science:
   - \( P(B|A) \approx 1 \) (assuming near certainty, though realistically less than 1)

4. Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \):
   - Since Jason's description suggests activities more closely related to computer science, we assume this probability to be significantly lower:
   - \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \) (a much lower estimate due to his non-alignment with typical humanities traits)

5. Total probability \( P(B) \):
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) \approx 1 \times 0.75 + 0.1 \times 0.25 \]
   \[ P(B) \approx 0.75 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) \approx 0.775 \]

Now apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{1 \times 0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.9677 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is approximately:

{"probability": "0.9677"}
