To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. 

We want to find P(CS | D), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description D.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- P(CS) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- P(D | CS) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D) is the total probability of the description across both disciplines.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- P(CS) = 75/100 = 0.75 (since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100)
- P(Humanities) = 25/100 = 0.25 (since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100)

Next, we assume P(D | CS) and P(D | Humanities). Based on the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science professors. We could reasonably assume that P(D | CS) is higher than P(D | Humanities).

Let's assign subjective probabilities based on the traits described:
- P(D | CS) = 0.9 (high, since the description strongly matches typical CS traits)
- P(D | Humanities) = 0.1 (low, as the description matches typical CS traits rather poorly)

Now, let's calculate P(D), the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | Humanities) \cdot P(Humanities) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
