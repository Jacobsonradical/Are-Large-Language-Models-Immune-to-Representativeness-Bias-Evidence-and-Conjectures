First, let's analyze the information provided and use Bayesian reasoning to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (prior probability) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(Hum) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to consider how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Given the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging; does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) as the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
   - \( P(\text{description} | Hum) \) as the likelihood of the description given a humanities professor.

   Without specific data on the exact likelihoods, we may assume an intuitive strong skew favoring computer science. For calculation, we might assume:
   \[
   P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} | Hum) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   We use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is given by:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]
   Now compute the posterior:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.9643"}}
\]
