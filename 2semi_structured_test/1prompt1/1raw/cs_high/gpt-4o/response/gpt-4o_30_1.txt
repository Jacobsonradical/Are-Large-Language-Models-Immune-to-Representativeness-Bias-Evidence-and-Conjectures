To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. The prior probabilities, in this case, are based on the initial proportion of computer science professors to humanities professors.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor (\( P(Hum) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Next, we consider the descriptions, specifically features like enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which seem to align more commonly with traits expected in computer science professors. However, we lack specific empirical data for those traits within the populations of each field. For the sake of this example, we assume that the traits mentioned in Jason's description heavily favor computer science professors.

Given this assumption, we'll denote:
- The likelihood of being described as Jason given that one is a computer science professor (\( P(D \mid CS) \)): High (let's assume 0.9 for highly biased evidence)
- The likelihood of being described as Jason given that one is a humanities professor (\( P(D \mid Hum) \)): Low (let's assume 0.1 for highly biased evidence)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25}
\]
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025}
\]
\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7}
\]
\[
P(CS \mid D) \approx 0.9643
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
