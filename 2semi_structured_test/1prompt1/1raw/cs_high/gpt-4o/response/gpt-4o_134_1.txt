To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Base Rates**:
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(\text{CS}) \), is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Humanities}) \), is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Let \( D \) denote the description given for Jason.
   - We need the likelihood of getting this description given that Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(D|\text{CS}) \).
   - We also need the likelihood of getting this description given that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) \).

For simplicity and based on the description, it seems more aligned with typical traits of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). We assign probabilities:
   - \( P(D|\text{CS}) = p \) (a higher likelihood, say closer to 1)
   - \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) = q \) (a lower likelihood, say closer to 0)

3. **Normalization**:
   - The total probability of the description \( D \) being observed, \( P(D) \), is:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
     \]
     Substituting the values, we find suitable \( p \) and \( q \):
     \[
     P(D) = (p \cdot 0.75 + q \cdot 0.25)
     \]

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)}
   \]

Assuming \( P(D|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \) and \( P(D|\text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \) based on the traits typical to a computer scientist:

\[
P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.6 + 0.025 = 0.625
\]

\[
P(\text{CS}|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.625} = \frac{0.6}{0.625} = 0.96
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is \( 0.96 \).
