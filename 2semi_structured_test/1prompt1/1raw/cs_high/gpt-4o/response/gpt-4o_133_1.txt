To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Prior Probability**: The number of computer science and humanities professors:
   - Total computer science professors: 75
   - Total humanities professors: 25
   - Total professors: 100

   Therefore, the prior probability P(CS) that Jason is a computer science professor is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   And the prior probability P(H) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Likelihood**: The probability of Jason's description given his field. Given Jason’s interests and traits, we might assume he is more likely to be a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging.

   Let's denote:
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \): the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor
   - \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \): the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor

   Based on the description:
   - It's reasonable to assume \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) \) is fairly high because Jason's traits and interests align closely with the characteristics often associated with computer science professors.
   - On the other hand, \( P(\text{description} \mid H) \) might be lower because his lack of interest in drawing or writing is less common among humanities professors.

   For illustration purposes, let’s suppose:
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid CS) = 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid H) = 0.1
   \]

3. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes’ theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \):

   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) is the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
   \]

   Now, calculate \( P(CS \mid \text{description}) \):
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.9643
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
