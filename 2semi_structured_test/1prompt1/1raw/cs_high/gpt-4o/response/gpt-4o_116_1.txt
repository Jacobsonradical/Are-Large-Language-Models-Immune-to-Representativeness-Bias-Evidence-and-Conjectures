We need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. We'll use Bayes' Theorem for this calculation.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as Jason's description.

We are asked to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

To compute this, we need:
1. \( P(C) \), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|C) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We now estimate the likelihood ratios:
- \( P(D|C) \) is presumably high because the description includes interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) that align well with computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \) is presumably low because these traits and interests are less common in humanities professors.

For the sake of estimation, let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, using the law of total probability for \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
