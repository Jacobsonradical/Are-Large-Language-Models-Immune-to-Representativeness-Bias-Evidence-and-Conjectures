To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need to determine the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a CS professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of Jason fitting the description given he is a CS professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of fitting the description, regardless of the department.

First, we need to explicitly state:
- There are 75 CS professors in the sample.
- There are 25 humanities professors in the sample.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a CS professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, let's denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor as \( H \).
The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \), probabilities that Jason fits the description given he is a CS or humanities professor, respectively. 

Given Jason's interests and traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it's reasonable to assume this description is much more likely to match a CS professor than a humanities professor:
\[ P(B|A) \approx 1 \]
\[ P(B|H) \approx 0 \]

The overall probability \( P(B) \) can be found as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (0 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.75 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 1 \]

So the probability that Jason is a CS professor is effectively:
