To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( HUM \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason as given.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(CS) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science department. We know there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Similarly, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities department (\( P(HUM) \)):

\[ P(HUM) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|HUM) \), the probabilities of the description given that the professor is from computer science or humanities, respectively. Considering the details of Jason’s description, he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strongly associated with computer science and not so common among humanities professors. This gives us a high \( P(D|CS) \) and a low \( P(D|HUM) \).

For the sake of simplicity, let’s make an educated guess here:

- Let \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high probability as these traits align well with computer science professors).
- Let \( P(D|HUM) = 0.1 \) (low probability as these traits are less common among humanities professors).

Now, we can find \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \cdot P(HUM) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.96 \).

Here is the final answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.96"}
