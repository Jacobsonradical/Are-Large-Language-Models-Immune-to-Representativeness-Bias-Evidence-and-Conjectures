To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

First, let's gather the given data:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( P(C) \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( P(H) \)).

Given no additional information about the descriptions’ likelihood given the profession before considering the specifics of Jason's description:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

We'll need an estimate for the likelihood of Jason's description given his field:
Assume the traits and interests described for Jason (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.) are much more likely in computer science than in humanities fields. Let’s assign typical likelihoods based on reasonable assumptions (not exact but reasonable for Bayesian estimation):

- \( P(D|C) \), the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor, is quite high. Let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \).
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor, is lower. Let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' formula:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately \( 0.964 \).
