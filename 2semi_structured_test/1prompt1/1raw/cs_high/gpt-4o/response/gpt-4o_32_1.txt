To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we proceed:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of randomly choosing a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
   - Probability of randomly choosing a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Likelihood of observing Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor: \( P(description | CS) \)
   - Likelihood of observing Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor: \( P(description | H) \)

Given the details of the description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which would be more common among computer science professors. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that:

\( P(description | CS) \) is significantly higher than \( P(description | H) \).

However, without specific numerical values for these likelihoods, we can make a subjective judgment based on the context provided. For simplicity, let's assign plausible values reflecting the descriptions:
   - \( P(description | CS) = 0.9 \)
   - \( P(description | H) = 0.1 \)

3. **Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We want to compute \( P(CS | description) \):

\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)}
\]

Where \( P(description) \) is given by:

\[
P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substituting in the assumed likelihoods and prior probabilities:

\[
P(description) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, calculating \( P(CS | description) \):

\[
P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = \frac{675}{700} = 0.9643
\]

So, the computed probability is approximately:

```json
{"probability": "0.9643"}
```

This indicates a high probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description and the Bayesian analysis.
