To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to employ Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, 
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the description provided.

First, let's identify the relevant probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\):**

   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is:
   
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complement Probability \(P(A^c)\):**

   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is:
   
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\):**

   The probability that Jason would have the given description if he is a computer science professor. Given the interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles, this is very high. We can assume this probability close to 1.

4. **Likelihood \(P(B|A^c)\):**

   The probability that Jason would have the given description if he is a humanities professor. This is relatively low, as the interests described are more typical of a computer science professor. Let's assign a small value, for instance, 0.1.

5. **Total Probability \(P(B)\):**

   The total probability of the description occurring can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 + 0.025 = 0.775 \]

Now, we can compute the required probability using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \approx 0.968 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.968.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
