To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Let's compute \( P(A) \):
- There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 total professors, so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Let's compute \( P(\neg A) \) where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor:
- There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Now, let's consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
Since the description of Jason matches traits more commonly associated with computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), we can make an educated guess about the likelihoods:
- Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (a high probability since the description fits well with a computer science professor).
- Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (a lower probability since the description does not fit as well with a humanities professor).

Now, compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.75) + (0.2 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{60}{65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{12}{13} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is about 0.923.

So, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.923"}
