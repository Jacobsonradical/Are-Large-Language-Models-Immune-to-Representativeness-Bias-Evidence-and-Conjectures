To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's break this down step by step:

1. **P(A)**: The prior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **P(\neg A)**: The prior probability that Jason is not one of the computer science professors (instead, a humanities professor).
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **P(B|A)**: The probability of Jason's description being given if he is a computer science professor. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (activities more common in computer science), we'll assume a higher likelihood here. Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]

4. **P(B|\neg A)**: The probability of Jason's description being given if he is a humanities professor. Given that the activities of coding and solving mathematical puzzles are less common in humanities, we'll assume a lower likelihood here. Let's assume:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \]

5. **P(B)**: The overall probability of the description. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.75) + (0.2 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.6 + 0.05 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.65 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.923 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.923.
