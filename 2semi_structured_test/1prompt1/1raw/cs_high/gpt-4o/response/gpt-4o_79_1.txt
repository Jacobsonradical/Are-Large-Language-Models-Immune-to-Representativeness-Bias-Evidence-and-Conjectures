To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can compute it:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science (P(CS)) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 75/100 = 0.75.
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (P(H)) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's traits given that he is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Based on the description, Jason enjoys activities typically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Let's denote:
- P(D|CS) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- P(D|H) = Probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that P(D|CS) is higher than P(D|H). For the sake of simplification without loss of generality, let’s assume:
- P(D|CS) = 0.9 (high probability of having Jason’s description among computer science professors).
- P(D|H) = 0.1 (low probability of having Jason’s description among humanities professors).

3. **Posterior Probability Calculation using Bayes’ Theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem states: 
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
     where 
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
     \]

Using the assumed values, let's calculate:
- P(D) = (0.9 * 0.75) + (0.1 * 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7.

Thus,
- P(CS|D) = \(\frac{0.9 * 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} ≈ 0.9643.\)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.
