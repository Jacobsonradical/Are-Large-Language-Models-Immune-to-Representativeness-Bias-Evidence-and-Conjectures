To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the description given for Jason.

Firstly, let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors.
- There are 25 humanities professors.
- Total professors = 75 + 25 = 100

So:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, let's consider \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \):

The description of Jason includes enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more associated with the activities of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, without specific details on the probability of these characteristics within each field, we can use intuition for a rough estimation:

Assuming subjective estimates based on the description:
- Let’s estimate \( P(B|CS) \) (the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor) to be 0.9.
- Let’s estimate \( P(B|H) \) (the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor) to be 0.1.

Now, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{675}{700} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.9643 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \(0.9643\).

So:
\[ {"probability": "0.9643"} \]
