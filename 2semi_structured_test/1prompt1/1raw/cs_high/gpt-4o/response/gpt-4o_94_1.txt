To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the given data and use the theorem accordingly.

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) = 75/100 = 0.75
- Probability Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) = 25/100 = 0.25

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Jason's description given his profession.

Jason's description fits well with characteristics often associated with computer science professors: enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, is highly creative with no interest in writing or drawing. These characteristics are generally more common among computer science professors than humanities professors.

Let's assume (for the sake of computation) that:
- Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor (P(D|CS)) = high, say 0.9
- Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor (P(D|H)) = low, say 0.1

We now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(CS|D) = (P(D|CS) * P(CS)) / (P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H))

Substituting the assumed values:

P(CS|D) = (0.9 * 0.75) / (0.9 * 0.75 + 0.1 * 0.25)
        = (0.675) / (0.675 + 0.025)
        = 0.675 / 0.7
        = 0.964

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.964"}
