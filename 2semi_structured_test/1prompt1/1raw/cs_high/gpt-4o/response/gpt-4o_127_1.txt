To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and let \( B \) be the event of the given description.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here is how we can determine each term:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **\( P(A^c) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( A^c \) denotes the complement of \( A \)).
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

3. **\( P(B|A) \)**: The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
   Given Jason's interests and characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying writing, it is more likely he is a computer science professor. For the sake of estimation, let’s assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (this would be higher due to his interests aligning more with computer science).

4. **\( P(B|A^c) \)**: The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
   Those characteristics are less likely for a humanities professor, so let’s assume \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \).

Now we need to find \( P(B) \):

\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
\]

Substituting the values we assumed:

\[
P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.964.
