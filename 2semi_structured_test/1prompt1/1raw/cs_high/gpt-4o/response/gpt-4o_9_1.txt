To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the probability of an event given prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Here's the setup:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to compute \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \). This can be broken down using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).

Given Jason's description, we can reasonably assume \( P(D | C) \) is high based on his interests and traits aligning more with computer science than humanities, though we need a specific value. Let's assume \( P(D | C) \approx 0.9 \) and \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \) since his hobbies and traits are strongly indicative of a computer science professor.

Now let's calculate:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.675) + (0.025) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.9643 \).
