To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which in this case can be articulated as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   There are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \):**
   There are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors:
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B | A) \):**
   The description provided fits characteristics that are more commonly associated with a computer science professor. However, the exact probability is not given, so we'll denote it as \( P(B | A) \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B | A^c) \):**
   The description is less likely to fit a humanities professor. Again, the exact probability is not given, so we'll denote it as \( P(B | A^c) \).

For simplification, letâ€™s assume the likelihood \( P(B | A) \) is higher than \( P(B | A^c) \). Since we are not given exact values, we'll consider the likelihood ratios.

In practical scenarios where data isn't provided, we often estimate these values based on subjective judgments inferred from the description characteristics:
   - Say \( P(B | A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood since profile matches typical characteristics).
   - Say \( P(B | A^c) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood since profile does not typically match).

5. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A | B) \):**
   Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
   \[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
   \[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} = 0.9643 \]
   
So, given the description, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.9643 or around 96.43%.

Thus, the answer is:

```
{"probability": "0.9643"}
