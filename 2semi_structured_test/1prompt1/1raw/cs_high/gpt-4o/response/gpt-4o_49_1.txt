To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to compute the probability of an event given some observed data.

First, let's state Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For our problem:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \)
\( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \] \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)
\( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given the description (which strongly aligns with the interests and traits of computer science professors), we can reasonably assume this probability is quite high. For argument's sake, let's approximate this probability as:

\[ P(B|A) \approx 1 \]

Now consider \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description, these traits (enjoys coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, not enjoying drawing or writing) are less common for humanities professors. We might approximate this probability as:

\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \)
To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Plugging the numbers in:
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.75 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.775 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' theorem
Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.75}{0.775} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.968 \]

Therefore, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.968.
