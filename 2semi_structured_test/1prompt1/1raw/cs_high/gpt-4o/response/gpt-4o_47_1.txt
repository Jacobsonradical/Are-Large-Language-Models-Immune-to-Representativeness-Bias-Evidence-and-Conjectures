To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:
- \( C \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor)

We need to determine \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \), the probabilities of the description being that of a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively. 

From the description:
- Jason enjoys coding.
- Jason enjoys solving mathematical puzzles.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing.
- Jason values ambition and creativity.

These traits seem much more aligned with computer science than with humanities.

Let's assume that the probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) = 0.9 \) (high probability the described person is a computer science professor)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.1 \) (low probability the described person is a humanities professor)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \):

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Where \( P(\text{description}) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
\]

So,

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[
\boxed{0.964}
\]

So the formatted response is:

```json
{"probability": "0.964"}
```
