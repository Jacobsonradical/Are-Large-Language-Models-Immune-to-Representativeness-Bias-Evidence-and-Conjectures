To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We're given that there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors in the sample. So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

We need to calculate the probability that Jason, given his description, is a computer science professor (\( P(C \mid \text{description}) \)). For that, we need the probability of the given description under both hypotheses (that Jason is a CS professor or a humanities professor).

Let \( D \) be the event that someone has the given description. We need:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]
Where \( P(D) = P(D \mid C) \times P(C) + P(D \mid H) \times P(H) \).

Now, we must estimate \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \).

Given Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and disinterest in drawing or writing, it's reasonable to assume that these traits are more likely to belong to a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, let's assume:

\[ P(D \mid C) \approx 0.9 \]
\[ P(D \mid H) \approx 0.1 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \times P(C) + P(D \mid H) \times P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7 \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(C \mid D) \):

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) \approx 0.9643 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.9643" \} \]
