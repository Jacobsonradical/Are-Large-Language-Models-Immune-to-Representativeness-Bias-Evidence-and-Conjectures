To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes’ theorem, which in this context is structured as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:

- \( P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let’s break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(\text{CS}) \)**:
    - There are 75 computer science professors.
    - The total number of professors is 100.
    - So, \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(\text{Humanities}) \)**:
    - There are 25 humanities professors.
    - So, \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)**:
    - The description of Jason aligns more with characteristics generally associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles).
    - Let’s assume, hypothetically, the probabilities:
        - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \) (high probability considering the description fits well with a computer science background).
        - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \) (low probability considering the description fits less well with a humanities background).

4. **Total Probability \( P(\text{Description}) \)**:
    - We use the law of total probability here:
    \[
        P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities})
    \]
    - Plugging in the numbers:
    \[
        P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.75) + (0.1 \times 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7
    \]

5. **Posterior Probability Calculation**:
    \[
        P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.75}{0.7} \approx \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964
    \]

So, approaching this from a Bayesian perspective, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.
