Sure, let's denote:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 75 computer science professors (\( P(C) = 0.75 \)).
- There are 25 humanities professors (\( P(H) = 0.25 \)).

Now, given Jason's description, we are trying to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).

Bayes' Theorem tells us:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of Jasonâ€™s description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which we can find using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

To find these probabilities, let's make some educated guesses based on the description. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are activities more closely related to computer science. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume the probability of his description, given he's in computer science (\( P(D|C) \)), is higher.

Let's assume:
\[ P(D|C) = 0.95 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.05 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.95 \cdot 0.75) + (0.05 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.7125 + 0.0125 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.725 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.95 \cdot 0.75)}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.7125}{0.725} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.983 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.983. 

Here is the formatted answer:

{"probability": "0.983"}
