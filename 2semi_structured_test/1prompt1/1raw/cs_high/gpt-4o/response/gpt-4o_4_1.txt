To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
2. \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 professors, \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
3. We also need \( P(B|A) \), the probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that Jason fits the description given that he is a humanities professor.

The description of Jason (interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.) suggests traits that are stereotypically more aligned with a computer science professor. While we do not have exact probabilities, we can reasonably assume that:
- \( P(B|A) \) is significantly higher than \( P(B|A^c) \).

To simplify, let us choose illustrative probabilities given the stereotypical alignment of Jason's characteristics with computer science:
- Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- Assume \( P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.964.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.964"}
