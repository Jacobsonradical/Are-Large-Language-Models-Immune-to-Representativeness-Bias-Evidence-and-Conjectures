To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) be the event of the description provided.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description (regardless of the field).

**Step 1: Determine the prior probability \( P(A) \).**
There are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors, so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**Step 2: Determine the complement \( P(\neg A) \), the probability Jason is a humanities professor.**
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.25 \]

**Step 3: Evaluate the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) (i.e., how likely is the description if Jason is a computer science professor).**

The description includes interests and traits commonly associated with computer science professors (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Hence, we'll assume \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high, say around 0.9 (90%).

**Step 4: Evaluate \( P(B|\neg A) \) (how likely is the description if Jason is a humanities professor).**

Given Jason's apparent lack of interest in drawing or writing (more common interests in humanities), the likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \) could be lower. Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) \) is around 0.1 (10%).

**Step 5: Calculate \( P(B) \) using total probability:**
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.7 \]

**Step 6: Apply Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.9643 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description provided, is approximately 0.9643.

Thus, the probability can be presented as:
