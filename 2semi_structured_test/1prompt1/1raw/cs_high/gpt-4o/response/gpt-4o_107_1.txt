To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood that Jason fits the description given that he is a computer science professor: \( P(D|CS) \).
   - The likelihood that Jason fits the description given that he is a humanities professor: \( P(D|H) \).

To simplify, without the exact likelihood values \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we'll assume that the description provided (which includes a strong orientation towards coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) is much more likely to fit a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Qualitatively, \( P(D|CS) \) may be significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \).

3. **Total Probability of the Description**:
   - \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given \( P(CS) = 0.75 \) and \( P(H) = 0.25 \), we need to consider that \( P(D|CS) \) is substantially higher than \( P(D|H) \).

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   - By Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \) is calculated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}. \]

Given the strong computer science-oriented traits in Jason's description and our assumption \( P(D|CS) >> P(D|H) \), it's reasonable to infer that \( P(CS|D) \) would approach a high value. Providing a qualitative guess based on the description suggests \( P(CS|D) \) might be close to 1. However, without exact numerical likelihood values, a reliable estimate would be:

\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.9 \quad \text{to} \quad 0.95. \]

Final answer (assuming the qualitative assessment leads closer to the higher value):

\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.95"}} \]
