To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) is the event that Jason's description matches the given profile.

1. **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability (P(A')):** The probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(A') = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

3. **Likelihood (P(B \mid A)):** The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor. Given his interests and traits, it is reasonable to assume Jason is more likely to be a computer science professor. For the purpose of this computation, let's assume:
   \[ P(B \mid A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Complementary Likelihood (P(B \mid A')):** The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor, which is likely lower due to his coding and mathematical interests. We might estimate:
   \[ P(B \mid A') = 0.1 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid A') \cdot P(A')} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.9 \cdot 0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 0.25} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.675}{0.675 + 0.025} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = 0.9643 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
