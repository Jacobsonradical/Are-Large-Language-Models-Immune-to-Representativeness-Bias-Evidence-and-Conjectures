To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science (\( P(CS) \)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods** (the likelihoods of the description matching a professor from each field):
   - Given the description, it seems more likely that Jason's interests and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and being conservative) align better with computer science than with humanities. For simplicity, let's estimate:
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood given his alignment with typical computer science interests).
     - \( P(\text{Description} \mid H) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the interests described).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be computed by the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Calculate \( P(\text{Description}) \):

\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.675 + 0.025 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.7 \]

Now plug this back into Bayes' theorem equation:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \]
\[ P(CS \mid \text{Description}) \approx 0.9643 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.9643.

So the final answer is:

{"probability": "0.9643"}
