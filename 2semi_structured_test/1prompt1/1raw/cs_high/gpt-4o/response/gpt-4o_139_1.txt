The question asks us to determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided. We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's identify and calculate each component needed for Bayes' theorem.

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\):**

The problem states there are 75 computer science professors and 25 humanities professors. The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **The overall probability of the description \(P(B)\):**

This would be the same whether Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor and is more challenging to calculate directly. However, in Bayesian analysis, we can simplify it using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
- \(P(CS)\) is the probability of selecting a computer science professor, and \(P(H)\) is the probability of selecting a humanities professor. These are given by the sample proportions, \(P(CS) = 0.75\) and \(P(H) = 0.25\).

3. **Likelihood \(P(B|A)\):**

Given the description, we have to assume how likely such a description fits a computer science professor relative to a humanities professor. Based on the description, characteristics such as enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing are more closely aligned with computer science than humanities.

Given that the description is more indicative of a computer science professor, we can assume \(P(B|CS)\) is higher than \(P(B|H)\). However, assigning exact values can be subjective. Let’s make an informed estimate:
- \(P(B|CS) = 0.9\) (high likelihood given this description fits a typical computer science professor)
- \(P(B|H) = 0.1\) (low likelihood given this description fits a typical humanities professor)

Now we can calculate the overall \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, we use Bayes’ theorem to find \(P(CS|B)\):
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.964"}\} \]
