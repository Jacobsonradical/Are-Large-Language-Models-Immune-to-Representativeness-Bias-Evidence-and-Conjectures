To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that Jason's description matches the given profile.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 75 computer science professors, out of 100 total professors, \( P(A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. Since there are 25 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, \( P(A^c) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

3. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. This is the likelihood of a computer science professor having the described traits.
   - \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. This is the likelihood of a humanities professor having the described traits.

Since we aren't given specific probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \), we'll assume that the description is more likely for computer science professors. Let's make a simplifying assumption that \( P(B|A) = p \) and \( P(B|A^c) = q \) where \( p \) > \( q \).

4. **Total probability of B:**
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \).

5. **Bayes' theorem:**
   - Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, we can compute \( P(A|B) \):
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{p \cdot 0.75}{(p \cdot 0.75 + q \cdot 0.25)}
   \]
   
Since without specific values for \( p \) and \( q \), but given the nature of the traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and not enjoying drawing or writing), we can reasonably assume that \( p \) (likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits) is significantly higher than \( q \). 

Let's suggest a reasonable assumption that \( p \) is much higher than \( q \), for example, let \( p = 0.8 \) and \( q = 0.2 \). Then,

\[
P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.75}{(0.8 \cdot 0.75 + 0.2 \cdot 0.25)} = \frac{0.6}{(0.6 + 0.05)} = \frac{0.6}{0.65} \approx 0.923
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately:
