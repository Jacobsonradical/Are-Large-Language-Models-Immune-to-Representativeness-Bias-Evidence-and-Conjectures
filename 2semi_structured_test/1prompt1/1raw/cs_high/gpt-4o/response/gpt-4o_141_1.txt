To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence. We can start by defining our events:
- Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We aim to find \( P(C | E) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (Jason's description). By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{P(E | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

We'll break this down into several steps:

1. **Prior probabilities (\( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \))**:
   - There are 75 computer science professors, so \( P(C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
   - There are 25 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Likelihoods (\( P(E | C) \) and \( P(E | H) \))**:
   - The description seems to strongly favor characteristics typically associated with computer science professors. Thus, we might initially hypothesize a high likelihood for \( P(E | C) \).
   - Conversely, the description includes traits less commonly associated with humanities professors, likely resulting in a lower \( P(E | H) \).

3. **Normalizing constant (\( P(E) \))**:
   - This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(E) = P(E | C) \cdot P(C) + P(E | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given the subjective nature of \( P(E | C) \) and \( P(E | H) \), let's estimate these values:
- Suppose \( P(E | C) \approx 0.9 \) (a high likelihood for a computer science professor based on the description).
- Suppose \( P(E | H) \approx 0.1 \) (a low likelihood for a humanities professor).

Now, apply these to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(E) = (0.9 \cdot 0.75) + (0.1 \cdot 0.25) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.675 + 0.025 = 0.7 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(C | E) \):
\[ P(C | E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.75}{0.7} = \frac{0.675}{0.7} \approx 0.964 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
