To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, it's important to consider the base rates which are the number of professors in computer science versus the humanities. 

Let's denote:

- \( P(C) \): The probability that a randomly selected description is from a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that a randomly selected description is from a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description given it is from a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given it is from a humanities professor.
- \( P(C|D) \): The probability that the description is of a computer science professor given the description (what we want to find).

From the problem:

- There are 25 descriptions from computer science professors and 75 from humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- And, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We don't have specific information distinguishing Jason's description as more likely belonging to either group, so we assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are assumed equal (and cancel out in the equation):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
