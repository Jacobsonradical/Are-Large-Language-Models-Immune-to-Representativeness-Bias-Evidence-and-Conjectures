To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. 

Given:
- 25 professors from computer science (CS) and 75 from humanities (H).
- A description of Jason that does not provide explicit evidence favoring one field over the other.

Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( H \) represent the event that he is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description \( D \).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) represents the prior probability of selecting a CS professor.
- \( P(H) \) represents the prior probability of selecting a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description \( D \) does not favor one field significantly over the other, we can assume:
\[ P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \]

Thus, the total probability of the description \( P(D) \) would be:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), those terms would cancel out in our calculation, simplifying it to:
\[ P(C|D) \approx \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = P(C) \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
