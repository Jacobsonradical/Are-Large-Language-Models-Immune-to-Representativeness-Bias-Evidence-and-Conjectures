First, let's consider the base rate (prior probability) of a randomly selected professor being from either computer science or the humanities.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors

Therefore, the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

And the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description of Jason, we need to determine how likely such a description would fit either group of professors. However, without additional specific details on traits that differentiate computer science professors from humanities professors, we assume the description applies equally well to both groups. This is often referred to as the assumption of "base rate parity."

Under the assumption of base rate parity,
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \]

Since these conditional probabilities are equal, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is simply the prior probability, which is:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
