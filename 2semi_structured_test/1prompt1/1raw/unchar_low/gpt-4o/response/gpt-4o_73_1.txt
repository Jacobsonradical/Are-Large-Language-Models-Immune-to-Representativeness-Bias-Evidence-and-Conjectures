To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the approach:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): The description provided fits Jason.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that Jason is a computer science professor,
     \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - Probability that Jason is a humanities professor,
     \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Posterior probability:**
   - We are given a description \( D \), which does not provide specific details distinguishing between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, we'll assume the description is equally likely for both groups.

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**

\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) can be broken down as:

\[
P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Assuming \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \) are equal:

\[
P(D|A) = P(D|B)
\]

Thus:

\[
P(D) = P(A) + P(B)
\]

Given the equal likelihood:

\[
P(D) = 1
\]

5. **Simplifying,**

\[
P(A|D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
\]

Since \( P(A) + P(B) = 1 \):

\[
P(A|D) = P(A) = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the equally likely descriptions for both groups, is:

\[
\{ "probability": "0.25" \}
\]
