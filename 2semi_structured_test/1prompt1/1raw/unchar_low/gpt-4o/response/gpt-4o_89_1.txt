To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group \( P(CS) \) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities group \( P(H) \) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Given the description, we want to estimate \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Since we do not have specific data about how likely such a description is in either field, we'll assume it is equally likely for simplicity's sake. That is, \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) are equal.

3. **Posterior Probability** - Applying Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Since we assumed \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \):
   \[
   P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   But specifically \( P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \left( P(CS) + P(H) \right) = P(D \mid CS) \left( 0.25 + 0.75 \right) = P(D \mid CS)
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D \mid CS)} = 0.25
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25, and the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
