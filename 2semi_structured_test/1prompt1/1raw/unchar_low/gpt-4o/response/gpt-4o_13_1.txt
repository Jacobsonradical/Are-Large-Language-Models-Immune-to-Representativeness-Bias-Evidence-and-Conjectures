To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors (C).
- There are 75 humanities professors (H).
- The total number of professors is 100.

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information to distinguish between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we have to assume that the description was equally likely to be picked for either group. Thus, the description is equally probable for both groups.

To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

The formula for the probability \( P(C | D) \) where \( D \) is the description is:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

However, since \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are the same and \( P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \), the conditional probabilities cancel out, simplifying the problem to:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

where
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor.

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

So, 

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
