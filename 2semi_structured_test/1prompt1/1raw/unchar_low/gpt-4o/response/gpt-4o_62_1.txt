To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to compute the posterior probability \( P(CS | D) \), where \( CS \) denotes that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( D \) denotes Jason's description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which, given our sample, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of Jasonâ€™s description occurring.

Since we do not have differential information that distinguishes computer science professors from humanities professors in Jason's description, we will assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \). Therefore, \( P(D) \) will be the weighted average of \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), but these probabilities cancel out in the final calculation.

Therefore, the probability \( P(CS | D) \) simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
