Let's assume that each professor, whether in computer science or humanities, is equally likely to have the described attributes. Therefore, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want \( P(A | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the probability of being a humanities professor.

Since the description does not inherently favor either group (we assume the traits are equally likely across disciplines), the likelihoods \( P(D | A) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are assumed to be the same.

Bayes' theorem gives us:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

But here, \( P(D) \) can be broken down into:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that \( P(D|A) = P(D|H) \), we can simplify:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.

The answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
