To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) for "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \( H \) for "Jason is a humanities professor."

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Weâ€™ll break this down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - Probability of choosing a computer science professor, \( P(C) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of choosing a humanities professor, \( P(H) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let's assume that the likelihoods of the description \( D \) given either \( C \) or \( H \) are roughly the same since there is nothing in the description that specifically distinguishes between humanities and computer science professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

3. **Total Probability**:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   
   Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), let's denote both \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) as equal probabilities \( k \). This simplifies to:
   \[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \] 
   
   Here, \( P(D) = k \) in our simplified model.

Given the above assumptions (that the description is equally likely for both groups), \( P(C|D) = \frac{0.25k}{k} = 0.25 \).

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
