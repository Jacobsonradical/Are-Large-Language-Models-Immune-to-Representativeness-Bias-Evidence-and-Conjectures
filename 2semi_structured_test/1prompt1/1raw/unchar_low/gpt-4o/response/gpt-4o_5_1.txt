To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that you have been provided a description of him randomly from the 100 available descriptions, you can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can simplify the computation by looking at the relative proportions.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- This makes a total of 100 professors.

Now, let's determine the probability, \( P(CS|J) \), that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Since the description doesn't provide any information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we'll assume the descriptions are equally likely for both groups. Therefore, we can use the prior probabilities directly.

The probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group, \( P(CS) \), is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.25"} \]
