To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll start by defining the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities (H) professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of getting Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of getting Jason's description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
\- There are 25 CS professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).
\- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors, so \( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We also need to express \( P(D) \) in terms of the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Unfortunately, without additional specific information on \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we'll need to make an assumption. If we assume that Jason's description is equally likely to be associated with either a CS or H professor, then \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) would be equally probable. This simplifies the calculation. But we will solve this based on our prior probabilities without additional specific weighting.

If we assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|H) \]

Since Jason's description seems quite general (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked), we might assume the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equivalent.

Thus, the computation simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
