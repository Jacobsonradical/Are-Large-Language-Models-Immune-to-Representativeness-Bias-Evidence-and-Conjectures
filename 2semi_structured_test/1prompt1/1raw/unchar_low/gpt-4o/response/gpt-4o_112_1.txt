To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Start by defining the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The provided description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We must also consider the complementary probability:
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Given values:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75.

We assume the description provided is equally likely for both groups, meaning \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). Thus, they cancel each other out in the formula:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is 0.25.

Here is the answer in the required format:
