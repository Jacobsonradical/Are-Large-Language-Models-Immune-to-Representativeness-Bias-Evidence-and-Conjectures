To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are looking for \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|C)\): The likelihood of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\): The overall probability of the description.

The prior probabilities are:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we don't have specific data that suggests the description is more likely to fit one group over the other, we assume \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\). This implies the description is equally likely for computer science professors and humanities professors.

Given this, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.
