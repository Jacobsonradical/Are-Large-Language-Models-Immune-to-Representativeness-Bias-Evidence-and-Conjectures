To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - Event A: Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Event B: Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - P(A): The probability of choosing a computer science professor is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors.
     \[
     P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]
   - P(B): The probability of choosing a humanities professor is the number of humanities professors divided by the total number of professors.
     \[
     P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - We assume the likelihoods of the description being given to a computer science professor and a humanities professor are the same because the description does not provide specific information favoring one over the other.

4. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we apply Bayes' theorem.
   \[
   P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where:
   - \(P(A \mid D)\) is the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
   - \(P(D \mid A)\) is the likelihood of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description.

   Since \(P(D)\) is the sum of the description's probabilities for both groups:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D \mid A) \times P(A) + P(D \mid B) \times P(B)
   \]
   
   If we assume \(P(D \mid A)\) and \(P(D \mid B)\) are equal, they cancel out in Bayes' theorem, simplifying the posterior probability to the prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
   \]
   However, using the proportions:
   \[
   P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
