To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This will allow us to update our prior beliefs based on the given evidence.

We'll start with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Assuming that descriptions are equally likely to describe professors from either group (given they are successful professors), the likelihoods \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) are equal.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Similarly,

\[ P(\text{Humanities} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Because the description does not provide any differentiating information about the likelihood of being a CS or Humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \) are the same. Therefore, we only need to consider the priors.

As a result:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

So the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
