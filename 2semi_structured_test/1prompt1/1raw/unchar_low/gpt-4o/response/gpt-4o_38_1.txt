To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) represents the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description is chosen at random and we have no reason to believe that the description of Jason is more likely to be typical of either group:

- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming that the description could just as likely fit a computer science professor as a humanities professor:
- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1 \) (because no unique traits for Jason are given that would differentiate between a computer science or humanities professor based on the description alone)

Now we calculate the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Now, plug the values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
