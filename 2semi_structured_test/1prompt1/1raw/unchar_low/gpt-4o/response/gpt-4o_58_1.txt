To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works:

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description given for Jason.

We are interested in finding \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we assume that the description applies equally well to professors in both fields (since we are not given information otherwise). Thus, \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). Given this, let's simplify the probabilities.

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), they cancel out in Bayes' formula. So our formula simplifies to:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{\frac{25}{100}}{\frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100}} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
