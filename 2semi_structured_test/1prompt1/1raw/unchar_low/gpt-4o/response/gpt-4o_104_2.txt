To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason is the subject of the description.

First, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now, we need the likelihoods:

- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the description does not give any specific information to differentiate between a computer science professor and a humanities professor, we assume that the likelihoods are equal:

- \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{ P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \).

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), we can denote this common probability as \( k \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
