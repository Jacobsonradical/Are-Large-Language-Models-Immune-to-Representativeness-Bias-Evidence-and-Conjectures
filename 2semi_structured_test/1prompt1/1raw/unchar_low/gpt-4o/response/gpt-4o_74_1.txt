Given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability. Bayes' Theorem helps in updating the probability estimates as new evidence is presented. Letâ€™s define the following:

- \( P(CS) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

From the problem statement, we have:
- Prior probability Jason is a computer science professor, \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Prior probability Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We assume that the description is equally likely among both groups if other information is not provided:

- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
