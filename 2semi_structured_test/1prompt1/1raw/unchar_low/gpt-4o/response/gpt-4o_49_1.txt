To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the calculation:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason matches the given description.

We are asked to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given that he matches the description.

First, we need the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the given description occurring if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of the given description occurring if Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the given description occurring.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming no inherent bias in the descriptions given for computer science and humanities professors (since we have no information suggesting otherwise), we consider \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) to be similar since the description does not mention any specific trait that would differentiate between the disciplines.

Thus:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \approx 1 \) because the description is quite general and equally likely to describe someone from either discipline.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \), and since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \):
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) \approx 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.
