To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which can be stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define the events clearly:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The provided description of Jason.

First, we determine \( P(A) \), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Similarly, the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor (\( P(A^c) \)):
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Since we have no additional information to suggest that the description is more likely for one group over the other, we assume these probabilities are equal:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

These equal probabilities imply that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = k \) where \( k \) is a constant. 

Then, we have:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = k \]

Thus,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
