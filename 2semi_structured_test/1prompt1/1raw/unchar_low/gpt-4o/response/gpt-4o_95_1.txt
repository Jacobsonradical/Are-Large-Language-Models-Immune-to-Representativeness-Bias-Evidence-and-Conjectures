To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Step 1: Define the events.
- Let \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

Step 2: Set up the known probabilities.
- The prior probability of being a computer science professor is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Step 3: Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem.
To use Bayes' Theorem, we need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We need to assume that the description of Jason given by the psychologists (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation, well-liked) applies equally in both fields because we do not have additional information indicating these traits are more common in one field over the other.

This means:
- The probability of Jason having the description (D) given he is in computer science, \( P(D|CS) \), is equal to the probability of Jason having the description (D) given he is in the humanities, \( P(D|H) \).

Assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \) for simplicity, since no additional differentiation between fields for the traits is given. Then:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

So:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
