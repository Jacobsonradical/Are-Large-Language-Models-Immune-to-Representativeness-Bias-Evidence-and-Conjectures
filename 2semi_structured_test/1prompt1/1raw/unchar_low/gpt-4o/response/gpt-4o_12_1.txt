To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(CS \mid D) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's determine each component required for the calculation:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \)**:
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors. Therefore,
   \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors. Therefore,
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \)**:
   Here, we assume that, because we have no specific data suggesting that the given description (D) is more likely for either group, the probability of the description being true given each group is equal. Therefore,
   \[ P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) \]

Since the description doesn't favor either group, we assume:
\[ P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H) = k \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(D) \)**:
   \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values we know:
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = k (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Thus, we can simplify the Bayes' formula:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

The final probability is:
\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}} \]
