To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description fits Jason.

Given data:
- There are \( 25 \) computer science professors.
- There are \( 75 \) humanities professors.
- The description is equally likely to describe a professor from either discipline.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- Probability that Jason is a computer science professor: \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- Probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we apply Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( P(B|A) \) (the probability that the description fits given Jason is a computer science professor) is assumed to be the same as \( P(B|A^c) \) (the probability that the description fits given Jason is a humanities professor), since the description is generic and equally likely to fit any professor.

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Thus:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).

The required answer in the specified format is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
