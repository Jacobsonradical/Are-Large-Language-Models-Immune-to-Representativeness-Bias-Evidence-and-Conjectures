Let's approach this problem using Bayes' theorem.

We need to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. This is \( P(CS | D) \), where:
- \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( D \) is the event of Jason's description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We break this into components:
1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D|CS) \): The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description among all professors.

### Step 1: Determine \( P(CS) \)

Since 25 out of the 100 professors are computer science professors,

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

### Step 2: Determine \( P(D|CS) \)

Without additional specific information distinguishing Jason's description among computer science and humanities professors, we assume the description is equally likely among all professors.

### Step 3: Determine \( P(D) \)

Because the description is assumed equally likely for all professors,

\[ P(D) = 1 \]

### Calculate the updated probability \( P(CS|D) \)

By Bayesâ€™ theorem, since \( P(D|CS) \) is proportional to \( P(D|H) \) and detailed information is not specified, we consider ratio maintenance. Thus,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
