To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description D.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of having the description D given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of having the description D.

Let's define the components:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is a CS professor).
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor).

Assuming the description D ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by colleagues and enjoys a positive reputation professionally") is equally likely to describe a professor from either field (since no specific biases toward either field are given in the problem), we have:

- \( P(D | CS) \approx P(D | H) \approx 1 \)

Therefore, the total probability \( P(D) \) can be considered as a weighted sum:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
