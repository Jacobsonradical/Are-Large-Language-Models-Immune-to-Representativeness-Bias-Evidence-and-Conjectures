To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context takes into account the base rates or prior probabilities as follows:

1. The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
2. The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description doesn't provide new information that distinguishes between the groups, we rely purely on these base rates.

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to calculate \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Here \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given no distinguishing features in the description, we can assume the description is equally likely to appear for computer science and humanities professors:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Thus,

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), say both equal to some value k:

\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
