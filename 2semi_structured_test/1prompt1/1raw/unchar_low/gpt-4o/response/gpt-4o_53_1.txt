To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS), we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the description given of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is from computer science given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D \mid C) \) is the likelihood of observing the description given that Jason is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of observing the description.

Given the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- Similarly, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since we have no reason to believe the description \( D \) favors one group over the other:
- \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \).

Now, let's calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid H) \), we can denote it as \( P(D \mid \text{any}) \), where \( \text{any} \) could be either CS or H:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \]

Therefore, since \( P(D \mid C) = P(D \mid \text{any}) \), these terms cancel each other out:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D \mid \text{any}) \cdot 0.25}{P(D \mid \text{any})} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
