To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, letâ€™s define the relevant quantities:
- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that Jason is chosen randomly from the descriptions.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given that he is chosen randomly from the descriptions.

We can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of choosing Jason from the computer science professors.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the computer science group.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of choosing Jason from the 100 professors.

Since Jason is chosen randomly, \( P(B|A) \) and the analog for humanities would be uniform within their group:
- \( P(B|A) = \frac{1}{25} \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = \frac{1}{75} \)

Where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

The prior probabilities are given by the ratio of professors in each field:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Using the law of total probability to compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{25} \times 0.25\right) + \left(\frac{1}{75} \times 0.75\right) \]
\[ P(B) = \left(\frac{0.25}{25}\right) + \left(\frac{0.75}{75}\right) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.01 + 0.01 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.02 \]

So applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{25}\right) \times 0.25}{0.02} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.01}{0.02} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.5 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.5.

Here is the answer in the required format:
