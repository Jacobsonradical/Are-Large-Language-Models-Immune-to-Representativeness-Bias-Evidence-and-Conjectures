To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Prior Probability (P(CS))**: This is the initial probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This is the initial probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood (P(D|CS))**: The probability of the description fitting a computer science professor.
4. **Likelihood (P(D|H))**: The probability of the description fitting a humanities professor.

Since the description provided does not give us any specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we assume the likelihood of the description being the same for both groups.

Thus, for simplicity, we can assume:
\[
P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
\]

5. **Posterior Probability**: Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) \) is the same for both groups, it simplifies the formula without computing,
\[
P(CS|D) \approx \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
\]
Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \),
\[
P(CS|D) = P(CS)
\]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the prior probability of being a computer science professor.

Therefore, we get:
\[
P(CS|D) = 0.25
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, based on the given information is:

\[
\{"probability": "0.25"\}
\]
