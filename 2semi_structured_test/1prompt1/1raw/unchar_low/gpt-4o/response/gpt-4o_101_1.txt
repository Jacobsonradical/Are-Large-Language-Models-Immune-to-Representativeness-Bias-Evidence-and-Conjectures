To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this particular scenario:

- Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( B \) be the event that a given description applies to Jason.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

**Prior probability \( P(A) \):**

There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A) \) is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

**Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**

The prior probability that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., is a humanities professor) is:
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

**Likelihoods \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**

The description given is generic and does not provide specific distinguishing information between computer science and humanities professors. Assuming the description fits equally well to both groups:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Thus, \( P(B) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B| \neg A) \cdot 0.75 \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \), let's denote this common likelihood as \( L \):
\[ P(B) = L \cdot 0.25 + L \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = L \]

**Applying Bayes' theorem:**

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Since \( P(B) = L \) and \( P(B|A) = L \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{L \cdot 0.25}{L} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:
\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
