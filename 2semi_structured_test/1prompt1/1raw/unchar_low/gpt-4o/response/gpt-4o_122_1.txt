To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the known quantities:
- The number of computer science professors (C) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (H) = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

We are given that the description we received is randomly chosen from the 100 available descriptions.

Step-by-step, Bayes' theorem can be stated as:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of a professor being from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

1. \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(H) \) is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are not explicitly given in the problem. Without additional specific information in the description that favor one group over the other, we assume that Jason's description is equally likely for both groups. So, \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \). This leads to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|C) \cdot 0.75 = P(D|C) \cdot 1 = P(D|C) \]

Thus, we simplify the application of Bayes' theorem to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Based on this, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
