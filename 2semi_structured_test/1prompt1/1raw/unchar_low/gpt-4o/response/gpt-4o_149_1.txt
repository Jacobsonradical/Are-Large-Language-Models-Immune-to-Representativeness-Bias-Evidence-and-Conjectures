To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let's define the events:
- \( A_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \): The description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(A_{CS}|B) \).

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A_{CS}) \): Probability that a random professor is from computer science = 25/100 = 0.25.
- \( P(A_{H}) \): Probability that a random professor is from the humanities = 75/100 = 0.75.

Since we have no additional information to suggest that the description is more likely to correspond to either computer science or humanities professors (given that the description doesn't favor one discipline over the other), we can assume that the likelihood of the description \( B \) given \( A_{CS} \) or \( A_{H} \) is the same. That is, \( P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \).

Given this assumption, the posterior probability \( P(A_{CS}|B) \) purely depends on the prior probabilities because \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{H}) \) cancel out in the Bayes' theorem formula:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H})} \]

Since \( P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{H}) \), we can simplify this to:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(A_{CS})}{P(A_{CS}) + P(A_{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.0} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
