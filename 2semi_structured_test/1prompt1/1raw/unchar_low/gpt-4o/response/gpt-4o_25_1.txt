Given that the description of Jason is selected at random from the 100 available descriptions, we can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor. However, without additional specific details about Jason that distinctly correlate with traits unique to either computer science professors or humanities professors, a straightforward application of probabilities based on the sizes of each group can be utilized.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D|CS) \): Probability of the given description if the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the given description if the professor is from the humanities.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

In the absence of specific traits in the description that affect \( P(D|CS) \) or \( P(D|H) \), we'll assume that the description is equally likely for professors in both fields. Therefore,
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), \( P(D) \) can be expressed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Therefore, \( P(CS|D) \) simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25 \cdot P(D|CS)}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
