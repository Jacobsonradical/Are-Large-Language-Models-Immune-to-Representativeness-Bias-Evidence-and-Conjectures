To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Letâ€™s define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason matches the given description.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, according to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description across all professors.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)** (not being a computer science professor):
   \[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

3. **Probability of the Description** (assuming the description is equally likely for all professors in either group):
   Because the problem does not provide specific likelihoods of the description matching, we assume they're equal across fields:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \] 
   
   This means the likelihood of Jason fitting the description is the same for both CS and humanities professors. Hence,:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \approx 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Now, substituting the values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

Here's the answer formatted as requested:
{"probability": "0.25"}
