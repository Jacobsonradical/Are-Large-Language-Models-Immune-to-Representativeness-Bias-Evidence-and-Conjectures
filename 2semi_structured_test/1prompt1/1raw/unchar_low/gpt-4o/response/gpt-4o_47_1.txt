To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here is the information given in the problem structured mathematically:

- Total number of professors: \( N = 25 + 75 = 100 \)
- Number of computer science professors: \( C = 25 \)
- Number of humanities professors: \( H = 75 \)

We are given a description of a professor chosen at random. We want to find the probability that this professor, Jason, is a computer science professor.

Bayes' theorem formula is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we will find the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{C}{N} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, assuming that the descriptions are equally likely for computer science and humanities professors (since we have no specific information to differentiate them), the probability \( P(B|A) \) for the description given a computer science professor is:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|C) = 1 \]

Similarly, the probability \( P(B|H) \) for the description given a humanities professor is also:

\[ P(B|H) = 1 \]

Therefore, the total probability of the description \( P(B) \) is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the description from both groups:

\[ P(B) = P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given both descriptions are equally likely:

\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.25) + (1 \cdot 0.75) = 1 \]

Now, we substitute these values back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25, or 25%.
