To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The information given allows us to calculate the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description.

The relevant probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description fits Jason.

Given:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
Since the description is chosen at random and contains no specific details that would differentiate between CS and Humanities professors, we assume:
\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

By Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting our probabilities:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.75} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), they cancel each other out:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
