To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. We start with the following information:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- A total of 100 professors.

To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we denote the events:

- \(A\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\): Jason has the described personality traits.

We need \(P(A|B)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor.
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \(P(B)\) is the probability of the description \(B\).

- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that a computer science professor fits the description \(B\).

Given the problem, we assume that the description \(B\) applies equally to any individual among the 100 professors because it is chosen at random. Thus \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\) (the probability of the description given humanities professors) should be equivalent:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times 0.25 + P(B|\neg A) \times 0.75 \]

Given the description is chosen at random and we lack specific details distinguishing the likelihood between the two groups, we assume \(P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A)\):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
