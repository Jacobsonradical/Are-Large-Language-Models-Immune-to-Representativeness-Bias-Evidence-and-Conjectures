To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given the description, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We start by defining:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Assuming no other additional information that differentiates the probability of the description between computer science and humanities professors (i.e., \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)), we rely on the prior probabilities only. These are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

If \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = k \) (a constant since we have no other distinguishing information from the description alone):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot P(A) + k \cdot P(\neg A) = k \cdot (P(A) + P(\neg A)) = k \cdot 1 = k \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{k \cdot P(A)}{k} = P(A) \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.25 \).
