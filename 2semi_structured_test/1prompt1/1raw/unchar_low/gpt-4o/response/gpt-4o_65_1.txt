To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \): Jason is one of the humanities professors.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

Prior probabilities are based on the number of professors in each group:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We do not have specific information to state that Jason's description is any more likely for computer science professors than for humanities professors. Therefore, we assume \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \) are equal. If this assumption holds, Bayes' theorem simplifies as follows:

\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(D|A)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D|A) = P(D|B) \), we can ignore these terms:

\[ P(A|D) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description provided, is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]
