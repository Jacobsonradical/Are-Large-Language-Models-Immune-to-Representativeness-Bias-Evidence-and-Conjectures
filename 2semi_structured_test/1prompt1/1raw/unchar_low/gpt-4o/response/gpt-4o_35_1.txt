To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the provided description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, letâ€™s define the events:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = Jason exhibits the given traits.

We need to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the traits described.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Assuming the traits described (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, etc.) are equally likely among both groups of professors (i.e., no bias in trait distribution between computer science and humanities professors), we can approximate \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \).

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), the numerator and denominator will be equally weighted by \( P(B) \) the probability of the traits given the overlap in characteristics.

Therefore:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

The required probability is 0.25.

So the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
