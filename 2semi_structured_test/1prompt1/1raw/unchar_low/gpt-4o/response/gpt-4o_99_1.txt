To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probabilities based on new evidence.

Given:
- The description is equally likely to be chosen from the 100 available descriptions.
- 25 computer science professors.
- 75 humanities professors.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To find \( P(C \mid \text{description}) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

We assume the description equally represents both groups, i.e., the probability of drawing the description for either group is proportional to their sizes.

Thus:
\[
P(\text{description} \mid C) = \frac{1}{25}
\]
\[
P(\text{description} \mid H) = \frac{1}{75}
\]

Since:
\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(\text{description}) = \left(\frac{1}{25} \times 0.25\right) + \left(\frac{1}{75} \times 0.75\right)
\]
\[
P(\text{description}) = \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100} = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C \mid \text{description}) = \frac{\frac{1}{25} \times 0.25}{0.02} = \frac{0.01}{0.02} = 0.5
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
