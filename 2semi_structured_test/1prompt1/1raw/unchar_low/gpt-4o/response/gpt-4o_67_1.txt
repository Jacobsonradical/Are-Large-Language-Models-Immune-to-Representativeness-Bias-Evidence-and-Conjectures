To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): The given description matches Jason

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(A^c) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We also need:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the given description for a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of the given description for a humanities professor.

However, due to the problem statement, we do not have specific probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \). A typical assumption in such cases, unless additional information says otherwise, is that each description is equally likely for members within each group. This means \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \).

When \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), Bayesâ€™ Theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(A) \cdot P(B|A) + P(A^c) \cdot P(B|A^c)} \]

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \),

\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

So, the approximate probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
