First, letâ€™s break down the problem using Bayes' Theorem. We need to find the probability \( P(CS|D) \), where \( CS \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( D \) is the description given.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(CS) \)**:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**:
\[ P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We lack specific information about \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). With the given information, we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups since nothing in the description strongly suggests a preference towards either group. Therefore, we assume \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \).

Since \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are assumed equal, the overall probability \( P(D) \) can be broken down as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) * P(CS) + P(D|H) * P(H) \]
Since \( P(D|CS) \) = \( P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = k * P(CS) + k * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = k (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = k (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = k \]

Now simplifying,

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is 0.25.

The final answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
