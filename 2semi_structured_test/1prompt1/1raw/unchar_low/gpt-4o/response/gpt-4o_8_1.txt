To determine the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, let's set up the information we have:
1. There are 25 tenured and successful computer science professors (C)
2. There are 75 tenured and successful humanities professors (H)

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description we have of him.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We can simplify this because \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are assumed to be equal (assuming descriptions are non-discriminative).

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Given that P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25 and P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
