To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given.

We need to compute \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

This requires us to know or estimate:
1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a person chosen at random is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D | C) \): The probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

Since the description does not mention field-specific characteristics, we can initially assume that the description is equally likely to describe any professor regardless of their field. This implies \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \).

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Therefore:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description is equally probable given either field, we have:
\[ P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | C) \approx P(D | H) \), let's denote this common probability as \( p \). Then:
\[ P(D) = p \cdot P(C) + p \cdot P(H) = p (P(C) + P(H)) = p \cdot 1 = p \]

So:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
