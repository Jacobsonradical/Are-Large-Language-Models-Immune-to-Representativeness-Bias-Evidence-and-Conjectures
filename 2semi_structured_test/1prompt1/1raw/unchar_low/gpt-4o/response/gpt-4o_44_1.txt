To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

We are given the following probabilities:
- The prior probability (\( P(A) \)) that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample. So, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

- The prior probability (\( P(\neg A) \)) that Jason is a humanities professor is the proportion of humanities professors in the sample. So, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We assume that the description probability (\( P(B|A) \)) of a computer science professor being described in Jason’s manner and the probability (\( P(B|\neg A) \)) of a humanities professor being described in Jason’s manner are roughly equal due to lack of detailed distinguishing information. Therefore, we might assume these probabilities are equal, let's denote them both as \( P(B) \). 

As such:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|\neg A) \) and with them both being the same, \( P(B) \) simplifies as the distribution is equal among descriptions.

Thus,

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Since both \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \) are expectedly equal given same descriptive likelihood:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25+0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1.0} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the description provided, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
