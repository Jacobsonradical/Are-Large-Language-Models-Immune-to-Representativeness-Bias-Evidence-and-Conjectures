To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this case, we have:

- \( P(CS) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(Hum) \): Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \( P(description | CS) \): Probability of the given description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(description | Hum) \): Probability of the given description given that the professor is from humanities.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since we are given the same description for both fields and don't have specific data on how likely the description is within each field, we assume that the description is equally likely for professors in either field. This means:
- \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we find:
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Given that \( P(description | CS) = P(description | Hum) \), they cancel out in the formula, simplifying it to:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
