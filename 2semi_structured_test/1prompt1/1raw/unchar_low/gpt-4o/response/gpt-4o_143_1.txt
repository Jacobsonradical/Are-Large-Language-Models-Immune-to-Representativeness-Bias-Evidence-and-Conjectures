Let's use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving the description of Jason.

We need to find:
\[ P(A|B) \]

To do this, we need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \), the probability of receiving Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \), the total probability of receiving Jason's description.

Let's break these down step-by-step:

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):**
   There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total. So,
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Probability of Description Given CS Professor (\( P(B|A) \)):**
   Since we don’t have specific data suggesting that the description makes him more likely to be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we assume this probability to be equal. Thus,
   \[
   P(B|A) = P(B|A^c)
   \]
   where \( A^c \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

3. **Total Probability of Jason’s Description (\( P(B) \)):**
   The total probability can be broken down using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)
   \]
   Given that:
   \[
   P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75
   \]
   And assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \) which implies no bias in describing the profiles of CS and humanities professors,
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A)
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A)
   \]

So finally,
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Since \( P(B|A) = P(B) \),
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
