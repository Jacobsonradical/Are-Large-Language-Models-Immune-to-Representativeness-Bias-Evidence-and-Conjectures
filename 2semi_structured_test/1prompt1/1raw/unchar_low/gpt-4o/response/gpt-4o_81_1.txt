To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- In total, there are 100 professors.

Bayes' theorem allows us to compute the probability of a hypothesis (Jason being a computer science professor) given some evidence (the description of Jason). However, the description provided does not particularly favor either group more than the other based on the information provided.

Therefore, we rely on the prior probabilities which are the relative sizes of each group. The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Profs}}{\text{Total number of Profs}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:

\[ P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Profs}}{\text{Total number of Profs}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since there is no additional information or reason to update these probabilities based on the description given, we stick with these prior probabilities directly.

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\{"probability": "0.25"\}
