To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this context, we want to update our belief about whether Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as being a computer science professor
- \(H\) as being a humanities professor
- \(D\) as the given description of Jason

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need the following components:
1. \(P(C)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \(P(D|C)\): The probability of the description given that the professor is in computer science.
3. \(P(D)\): The total probability of the description across both groups.

Assuming there is no bias in the descriptions referring to either group, we can make the following approximations:

Since there are a total of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, without additional information about how the description correlates with being in computer science or humanities, we can assume that the description is equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1 \]

Using these values in Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \]

Now, apply these values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
