Indeed, we need to use Bayes' Theorem here to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (letâ€™s denote this as \( P(CS|D) \)), given the description (D).

First, we need to determine:

1. \( P(CS) \): the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \): the prior probability of being a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|CS) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Calculations:
1. \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors).
2. \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors).

Assuming that the description is equally probable for both groups (which might not be the best assumption without more information, but we'll assume it for simplicity):
3. \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) = 1 \).

4. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.75 = 1 \]

Finally, according to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

Thus, the answer is: {"probability": "0.25"}
