To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

We'll break this into parts:
1. \( P(C) \), the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \), the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D|C) \), the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description.

First, compute the prior probabilities:
\[
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Since the description is chosen at random and we have no reason to believe it is more common in one group than the other:
\[
P(D|C) = P(D|H)
\]

Thus, the denominator \( P(D) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can simplify:
- Let \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) = k \).

Then:
\[
P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = k \cdot 1 = k
\]

Substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot P(C)}{k} = P(C)
\]

Thus:
\[
P(C|D) = P(C) = 0.25
\]

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
