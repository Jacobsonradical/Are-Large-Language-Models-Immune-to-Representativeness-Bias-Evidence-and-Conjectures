To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the specific description, we use Bayes' theorem. Here is how you can compute it:

1. **Determine the base rates (prior probabilities):**
   - Number of computer science professors (\(C\)) in the sample: 25
   - Number of humanities professors (\(H\)) in the sample: 75
   - Total number of professors: \(25 + 75 = 100\)
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Assess the likelihood of the description given the field:**
   - Given that the description is vague and quite general (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation), we might assume that the likelihood of this description could be similar for both fields.
   - Let's assume \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) = P(\text{Description} \mid H) = 1\).

3. **Compute the posterior probabilities:**
   - According to Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid C) \times P(C)}{P(\text{Description})}
     \]
   - Now, \(P(\text{Description})\):
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid C) \times P(C) + P(\text{Description} \mid H) \times P(H)
     \]
     Since \(P(\text{Description} \mid C) = P(\text{Description} \mid H) = 1\):
     \[
     P(\text{Description}) = 1 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.75 = 1
     \]

4. **Simplify the posterior probability:**
   - Given \(P(\text{Description}) = 1\):
     \[
     P(C \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(\text{Description})} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
     \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
