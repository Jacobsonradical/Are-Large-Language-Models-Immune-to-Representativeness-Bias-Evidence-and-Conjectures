To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem, which can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's represent the known information:
- \( n_{\text{CS}} = 25 \): Number of computer science professors.
- \( n_{\text{Hum}} = 75 \): Number of humanities professors.
- Total number of professors \( n = 100 \).

To find \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{n_{\text{CS}}}{n} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, to find \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability that Jason is a humanities professor):
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{n_{\text{Hum}}}{n} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups (as there is no indication otherwise):
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]

Given that we assume the descriptions are equally likely:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

To find \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the description), consider:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
