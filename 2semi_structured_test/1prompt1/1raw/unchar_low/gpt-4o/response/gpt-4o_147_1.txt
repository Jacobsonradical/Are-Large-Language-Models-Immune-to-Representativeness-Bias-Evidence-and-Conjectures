To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) = The observed description of Jason.

We are looking for \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of observing Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing Jason's description.

First, we calculate \( P(A) \):

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, we need \( P(B) \). This is a bit more challenging because it involves both groups of professors. Assume that the likelihood of Jason's description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. Thus, the distribution of descriptions should reflect their proportions in the overall sample:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
\]

Since the descriptions are equally likely between the groups:

\[
P(B \mid \text{CS}) = P(B \mid \text{Humanities})
\]

Thus:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid \text{CS}) \cdot 0.25 + P(B \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot 0.75
\]

Given the assumption of equal likelihood, \( P(B \mid \text{CS}) = P(B \mid \text{Humanities}) \), so we simplify:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid \text{CS})
\]

Now we return to Bayes' theorem. Since:

\[
P(B \mid A) = P(B \mid \text{CS}) \quad \text{and} \quad P(B) \approx P(B \mid \text{CS})
\]

We get:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid \text{CS}) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B \mid \text{CS}) \cdot 0.25}{P(B \mid \text{CS})} = 0.25
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
