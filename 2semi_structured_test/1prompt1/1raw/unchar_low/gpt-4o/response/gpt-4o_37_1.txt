To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the event that the description provided applies to Jason.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
- \( P(A^c) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75

Since no specific details in the description (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) indicate a clear difference between the two fields, we will assume \( P(B|A) \), the probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor, is the same as \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Therefore, we treat these two probabilities as equal.

The overall probability \( P(B) \) (the probability of the description) can be computed as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) are equal, letâ€™s denote this common probability as \( P(B|A) \):
 
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) ( P(A) + P(A^c) ) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times 1 \]
 
Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A)} = P(A) \]

So, the probability remains unchanged as:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
