To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the prior probability and the likelihood of the given description being associated with computer science professors compared to humanities professors.

1. The prior probability \(P(\text{CS})\) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor is:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The prior probability \(P(\text{H})\) that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional information specific to Jason's description directly related to the likelihood of being a computer science or humanities professor, we'll assume that the description is equally likely for both groups. Therefore, the likelihood ratio \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) / P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) = 1\).

Using Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \(P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description})\):
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H}) \times P(\text{H})} \]

Since \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS})\) and \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{H})\) are equally likely, they cancel out. So, we simplify to:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
