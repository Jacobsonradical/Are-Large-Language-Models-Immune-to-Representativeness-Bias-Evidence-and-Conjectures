To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this case can be structured as follows:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event of the description given for Jason.

First, let's identify the probabilities:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100, so \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(\lnot A)\) is the probability that Jason is not a computer science professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100, so \(P(\lnot A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Now, let's assume \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\lnot A)\) are equal since we have no additional information indicating that the description provided (ability, motivation, and likability) is more likely among one group than the other. Thus:
- \(P(B|A) = P(B|\lnot A)\).

Given that \(P(B|A)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor and \(P(B|\lnot A)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, and under our assumption that the description is equally likely for both groups, we have:

\[
P(B|A) = P(B|\lnot A) = 1
\]

Since both likelihoods are equal, we now calculate the overall probability \(P(B)\):
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\lnot A)P(\lnot A)
\]
\[
P(B) = 1 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
\]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
