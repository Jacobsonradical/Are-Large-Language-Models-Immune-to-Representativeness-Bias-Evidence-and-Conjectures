Given that you have been presented with a random description from the 100 available descriptions, we should use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (C_S) given the description (D).

However, we are initially considering just the base rates since there are no traits that sharply distinguish between the computer science and humanities professors in the given description. Here are the calculations:

Probability of a computer science professor (P(C_S)) = 25/100 = 0.25  
Probability of a humanities professor (P(H)) = 75/100 = 0.75

Without additional specific distinguishing features in the description that would modify these probabilities based on personality traits identified by the psychologists, the probability remains based on the simple ratio of professors in each group.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:

\[ P(C_S | D) = \frac{P(C_S)}{P(C_S) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{\ "probability": "0.25" }
