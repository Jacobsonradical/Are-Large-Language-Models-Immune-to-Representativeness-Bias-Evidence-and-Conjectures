To calculate our probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We begin by determining:

- The probability of picking a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)).
- The probability of picking a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)).
- The probability of the given description \(P(D|CS)\) for a computer science professor.
- The probability of the given description \(P(D|H)\) for a humanities professor.

For simplicity, we'll assume the probability of the description being the same for any professor, regardless of their discipline, which leads us to:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Since the description D is chosen randomly and without any further distinguishing characteristics, we can assume that:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Now, let's focus on the following probabilities:
- The probability of being a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The probability of being a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D)\) is the same for both groups, it cancels out, simplifying the problem to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
