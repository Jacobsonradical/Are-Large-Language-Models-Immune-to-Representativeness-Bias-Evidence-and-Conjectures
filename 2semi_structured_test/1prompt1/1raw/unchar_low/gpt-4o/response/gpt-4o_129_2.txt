To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \) = The description fits Jason.

2. **Known quantities:**
   - \( P(A) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(\neg A) \) = Probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Assume**: Without specific details about the description fitting different disciplines, we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \). 

Given no information distinguishing between the likelihoods for computer science and humanities professors fitting the description of Jason, we assume equal likelihood. This means the probability is based purely on the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this case:
\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \]

### Simplifying the problem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|A)} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).
