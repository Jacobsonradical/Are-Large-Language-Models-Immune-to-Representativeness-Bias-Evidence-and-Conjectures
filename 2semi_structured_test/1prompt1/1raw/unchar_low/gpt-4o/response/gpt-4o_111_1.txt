Sure, let's solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem. We have two groups in the sample: 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science and 75 in the humanities. We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, which we will denote as \( P(CS | D) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability can be calculated as:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Given the data, we have:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Assuming the description of Jason is equally likely for both groups (since we have no reason to believe otherwise):

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \]

However, since we are dealing with descriptive probability and itâ€™s given that Jason is chosen at random:

\[ P(D | CS) = P(D | H) = 1 \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = (1 \cdot 0.25) + (1 \cdot 0.75) = 1 \]

Since the descriptions for both groups are equally likely, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
