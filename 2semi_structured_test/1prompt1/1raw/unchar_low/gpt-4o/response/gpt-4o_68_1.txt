To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we do it:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor**:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   Prior probability of being a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor vs. a humanities professor**:
   We need to consider that Jason's description (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked) could apply to professors in both fields. Without specific data on how likely this description is for each group, we'll assume that the description is equally likely to describe professors from both fields. Therefore:
   \[
   P(Description|CS) = P(Description|H)
   \]

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   Now, since we are assuming \(P(Description|CS) = P(Description|H)\), and recognizing that:
   \[
   P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|H) \times P(H)
   \]
   We see that \(P(Description)\) simplifies to a value proportional to \(P(CS)\) and \(P(H)\).

Given that the description doesn't differentiate probability between CS and H, we just rely on the prior probabilities. So:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = P(CS) = 0.25
   \]

Hence the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}}
\]
