To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, it is important to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Let:
- \( CS \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the provided description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Let's break it down:
- \( P(CS) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor): \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor): \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description \( D \) is neutral and gives no particular favor towards either group, \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) can be considered equal because they both reflect a common description applicable to both groups.

So, if \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), we can simplify the problem to solving these probabilities with equal likelihood:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), the calculation simplifies further:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS + H) \]

Given \( CS \) and \( H \) are exhaustive and mutually exclusive:

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot 1 = P(D | CS)
\]

Now,
\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS)} = 0.25
\]

Therefore:

{"probability": "0.25"}
