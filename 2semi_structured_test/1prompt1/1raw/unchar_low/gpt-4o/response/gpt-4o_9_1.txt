To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We seek the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided. 

Let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Jason's description.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \). According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

From the details of the study:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- The number of computer science professors is 25.
- The number of humanities professors is 75.

So, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description does not provide any specific predictive information favoring one group over the other, we assume that the likelihood \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Hence, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

Putting in the values:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
