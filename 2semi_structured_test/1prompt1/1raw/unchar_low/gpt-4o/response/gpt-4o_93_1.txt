To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The goal is to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, letâ€™s define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

Since we do not have specific details about the descriptions beyond their being well-liked and motivated, we assume that \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \); this means the description is equally likely regardless of Jason's field.

Next, we determine the priors based on the sample sizes:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), it simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|C) \cdot P(H) = P(D|C) (P(C) + P(H)) = P(D|C) \]

Thus, Bayes' Theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C)} = P(C) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

And the answer in the requested format is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
