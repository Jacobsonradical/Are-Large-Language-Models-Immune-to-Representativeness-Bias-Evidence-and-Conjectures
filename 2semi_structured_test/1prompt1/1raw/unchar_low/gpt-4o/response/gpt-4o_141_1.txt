To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description we have of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each component:

1. **\( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **\( P(B) \)**: The total probability that the description fits a professor (regardless of their field). To find this, we need:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

where \( A^c \) is the event that the professor is not from computer science (i.e., a humanities professor), and:
\[ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

3. **\( P(B|A) \)** and **\( P(B|A^c) \)**: The probabilities that the description fits a professor from computer science and humanities, respectively. Since the description given does not provide specific distinctions between computer science and humanities professors, we assume these probabilities to be equal.

Thus, assuming \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) = P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 = P(B|A) \]

Since \( P(B|A) \) is common, we can skip its actual value, and it balances out in the formula.

Therefore, we can directly compute:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25:
