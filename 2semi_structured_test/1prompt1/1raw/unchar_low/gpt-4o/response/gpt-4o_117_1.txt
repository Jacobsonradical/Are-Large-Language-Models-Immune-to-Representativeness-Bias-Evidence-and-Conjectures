To solve for the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors among the sample, we use Bayes’ theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes’ theorem states:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

First, we determine the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Given no additional distinguishing information in the description to make the likelihoods unequal, we assume that the description \( D \) is equally likely for both categories (computer science and humanities). Thus \( P(D | C) = P(D | H) \).

Given these are equal, let's call it \( k \):

\[
P(D | C) = k
\]
\[
P(D | H) = k
\]

The overall probability of \( D \) occurring, \( P(D) \), is:

\[
P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

\[
P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k (0.25 + 0.75) = k
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"}
\]
