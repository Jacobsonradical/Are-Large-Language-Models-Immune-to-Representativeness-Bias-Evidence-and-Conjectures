To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. 

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Prior Probability:
   - Probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that a professor chosen at random is a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Likelihood:
   - Without additional information, we'll assume that the descriptive traits ("high ability and strong motivation, well-liked by his colleagues, enjoys a positive reputation") are equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors. Thus, \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are assumed to be equal or not significantly different.
   
Since there's no additional detail to distinguish between the two groups based on the description provided, we assume that:
   - \(P(D|CS)\) = \(P(D|H)\)

3. Posterior Probability:
   By Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
