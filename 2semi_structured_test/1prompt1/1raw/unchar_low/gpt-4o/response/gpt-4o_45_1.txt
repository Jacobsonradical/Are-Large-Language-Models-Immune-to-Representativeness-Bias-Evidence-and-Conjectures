To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a professor in the humanities.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(A) \)) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(B) \)) = 75

We are given that there is one randomly chosen description from the total pool of 100 descriptions, and the description does not provide any additional information that distinguishes between the two groups.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is given by:

\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since we do not have any distinguishing characteristics in the description, we assume the likelihood of the description given either event is identical:

\[ P(\text{Description} \mid A) = P(\text{Description} \mid B) \]

Therefore, the denominator simplifies to the total number of professors:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid A) \cdot 25 + P(\text{Description} \mid B) \cdot 75}{100} \]

Given that the probability of the description under either event is the same:

\[ P(\text{Description} \mid A) = P(\text{Description} \mid B) =  P(\text{Description}) / 100 \]

As the likelihoods are the same, we have:

\[ P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} \]

Since \( P(A) = 0.25 \) and \( P(B) = 0.75 \):

\[
P(A \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{25}{25 + 75} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
