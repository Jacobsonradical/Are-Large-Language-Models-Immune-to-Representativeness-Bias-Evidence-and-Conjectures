To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H) in the sample.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description among all professors.

 \( P(CS) \) is computed as:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

 \( P(H) \) is computed as:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the description given is equally likely for both groups:

\[ P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \]

Since specific details of likelihood are not given, we assume the description is equally probable for both groups:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Given \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), they cancel out:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

The finalized probability is derived as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{1.00} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is \( 0.25 \).

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
