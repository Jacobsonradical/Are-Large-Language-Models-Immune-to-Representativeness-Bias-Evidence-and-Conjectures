To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science (CS) professor given the description. Letâ€™s define:

- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( B \) as the event of Jason fitting the given description.

First, we calculate each component needed for Bayes' theorem:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor. Given there are 25 CS professors out of 100 professors, this is 25%.
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description fitting a CS professor. We assume this probability is the same for all professors given that it is chosen at random from a description of 100 professors. Thus,
  \[ P(B|A) = \frac{1}{100} \]

- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description fitting any professor. Since the description is randomly chosen from 100 descriptions:
  \[ P(B) = 1 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \cdot 0.25}{1} = \frac{0.25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
