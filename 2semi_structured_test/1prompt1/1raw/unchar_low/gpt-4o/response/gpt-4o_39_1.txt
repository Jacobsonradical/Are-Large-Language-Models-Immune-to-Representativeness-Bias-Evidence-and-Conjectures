To determine the probability, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of seeing Jason's description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)).
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)).
- We do not have specific information making \( P(B|A) \) different from \( P(B|H) \). Thus, we'll assume descriptions are equally likely for both groups, making \( P(B|A) = P(B|H) \).

Therefore, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.75 \)
- \( P(B|A) = P(B|H) \), so \( P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|H) * P(H) \) simplifies as they are equally likely.

Given the equal likelihood assumption:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|H) * P(H)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, Jason has a probability of 0.25 of being one of the computer science professors chosen in the sample.
