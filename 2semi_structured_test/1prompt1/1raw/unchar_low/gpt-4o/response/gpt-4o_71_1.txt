To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's denote the relevant events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor

We need to find \(P(C | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Prior probabilities are:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we don't have any additional specific information about Jason that could give us a likelihood function differentiating between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the description \(D\) is equally likely for both groups. Hence:
- \(P(D | C) = P(D | H)\)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \(P(D)\) is a normalization factor and given that \(P(D | C) = P(D | H)\):
\[
P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Because \(P(D | C) = P(D | H)\), they cancel out in the formula. Let's define that constant probability as \(k\):
\[
P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) = k \cdot 1 = k
\]
\[
P(C | D) = \frac{k \cdot P(C)}{k} = P(C)
\]

Conclusively:
\[
P(C | D) = P(C) = 0.25
\]

Here is the probability in the requested format:
