The problem described is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem for conditional probability. We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. 

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) = event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) = event of Jason's description.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to compute each part of this formula.

1. \( P(C) \), the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(H) \), the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. \( P(D|C) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|H) \), the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, are what we usually need to evaluate based on how well the description fits. However, since the description contains relatively neutral information that could equally apply to either field (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation), without additional distinctive details that clearly indicate one particular group of professors over the other, we can reasonably assume \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \).

4. Since \( P(D|C) \approx P(D|H) \), we can use:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given our assumption, this simplifies to:

\[ P(D) \approx P(D|C) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(D|C) \]

Therefore, we can simplify Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) \approx \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|C)} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
