Certainly! To compute this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason meets the description provided.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's how we can estimate these probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   Since there are 25 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of Jason meeting the description given that he is a computer science professor.
   Assuming the description is equally likely for any professor:
   \[ P(B|A) \approx 1 \]

3. \( P(B) \): The overall probability that Jason meets the description.
   This would be a weighted average of the probabilities that a computer science professor or a humanities professor meets the description:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
   Where \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]
   Given no information suggests a different probability of matching the description between the two groups:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 1 \]
   Hence:
   \[ P(B) = (1 \times 0.25) + (1 \times 0.75) = 1 \]

Combining these, we get:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25 \times 1}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
