To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- A total of \(100\) professors were surveyed.
- Out of these, \(25\) are from computer science (CS) and \(75\) are from the humanities.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \(P(C \mid E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \(E\) (the description provided).

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E \mid C)\) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(E)\) is the overall probability of the evidence.

Given the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the evidence (description of Jason) is equally likely to apply to professors from both departments:
\[ P(E \mid C) = P(E \mid H) \]

Since \(P(E)\) can be expressed in terms of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

And given \(P(E \mid C) = P(E \mid H)\), this simplifies to:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \left[ P(C) + P(H) \right] = P(E \mid C) \]

So, \(P(E \mid C)\) cancels out in our simplified Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
