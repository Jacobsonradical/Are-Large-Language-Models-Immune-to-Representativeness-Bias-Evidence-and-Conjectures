To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We should consider the prior probabilities and how likely the description is for each group.

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- A description of one professor was chosen at random.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the given description.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The probability of choosing the given description of Jason from each group (while this is not explicitly given in the question, we assume it's equally likely for any professor to be described in this way, making \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) comparable). We'll assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \), and assuming \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.75 \]

Because \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|H) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(D|H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|H)} \]

And since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, our revised probability, considering the description and sample sizes, remains:
\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\} \]
