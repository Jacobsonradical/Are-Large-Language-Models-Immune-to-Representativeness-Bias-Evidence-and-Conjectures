To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant components:

- \(P(CS)\): the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from computer science. There are 25 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors, so \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(H)\): the prior probability that a professor chosen at random is from the humanities. There are 75 humanities professors out of the total 100 professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We need to find \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\), compared to \(P(H|D)\), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor given his description \(D\). 

Given no specific detailed information differentiating personality traits common to the two fields in Jason's description, we assume each description is equally likely for both fields:

- Let \(P(D|CS)\) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- Let \(P(D|H)\) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

Assuming that \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\) because the description does not favor either group explicitly:

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D)\) is the same for both, we normalize the probabilities:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H)} \]

Since \(P(D|CS) = P(D|H)\), the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

{"probability": "0.25"}
