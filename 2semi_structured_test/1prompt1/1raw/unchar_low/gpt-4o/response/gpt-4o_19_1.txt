To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so the prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(A_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
  \[ P(A_{Hum}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we have no reason to believe that the description is more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor, we assume:
\[ P(B|A_{CS}) = P(B|A_{Hum}) = 1 \]

So, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(B)} \]

Since \( P(B|A_{CS}) \) and \( P(B|A_{Hum}) \) are equal, P(B) will be:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(B|A_{Hum}) \cdot P(A_{Hum}) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1 \]

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_{CS}|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.25" \} \]
