To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A occurring given event B has occurred.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B occurring given event A has occurred.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

In this context:
- Let event A be "Jason is a computer science professor."
- Let event B be "the description given."

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability of a randomly chosen professor being a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25.
- \( P(A') \) = Probability of a randomly chosen professor being a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75.

Next, we consider the description's likelihood. Since the description given is quite general and doesn't contain specific indicators that would favor either field (both computer science and humanities professors can be highly motivated, well-liked, and have a strong reputation), we assume that the probability of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor is equal to the probability of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Thus, \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \).

Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)} \]

Given the symmetry and approximate equal probabilities for the description:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
