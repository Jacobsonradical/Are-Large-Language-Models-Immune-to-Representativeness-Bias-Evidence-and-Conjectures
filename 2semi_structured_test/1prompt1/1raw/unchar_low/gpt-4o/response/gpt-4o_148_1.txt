To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- The prior probability of being a computer science professor \( P(CS) \) is the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The prior probability of being a humanities professor \( P(H) \) is the ratio of humanities professors to the total number of professors: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We need the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. To do this, let's define:
- \( P(D | CS) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) as the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

However, since we don't have any specific information that differentiates the descriptions of computer science and humanities professors, we can assume \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \). This assumption makes our calculation simpler since these probabilities would cancel out in Bayes' theorem.

Therefore, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly,
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \), the probabilities \( P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \).

Given \( P(CS) = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = 0.75\), we have:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D | H) \cdot 0.75} \]

Since \( P(D | CS) = P(D | H) \),
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).
