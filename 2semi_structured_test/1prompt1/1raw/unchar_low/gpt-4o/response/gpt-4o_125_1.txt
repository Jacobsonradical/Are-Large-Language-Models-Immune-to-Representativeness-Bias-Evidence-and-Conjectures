First, let's apply Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, letâ€™s determine these probabilities:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, \( P(A) = 25/100 = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary prior probability \( P(A^c) \):**
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - So, \( P(A^c) = 75/100 = 0.75 \).

3. **Probability of the description given the field (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \)):**
   - Without additional information, assume that the description "high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation" has the same probability for both fields.
   - Let \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = k \).
   
4. **Total probability of the description \( P(B) \):**
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \)
   - Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) = k \), we get:
   \[ P(B) = k \times 0.25 + k \times 0.75 = k \]

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \) and both are equally likely, we can simplify the theorem to:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
