To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem can be applied as follows:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Note that since we have no further differentiating information in Jason's description that could provide a different likelihood for him being in one group versus another, we can assume that descriptions were written with equal probability across both groups. 

Hence, we are looking at the relative counts in the initial sample without additional information that changes the likelihoods:

The posterior probability \( P(\text{CS Professor} \mid \text{Jason's description}) \) is therefore just the ratio of the number of computer science professors to the total number of professors.

This gives us:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor} \mid \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS Professor})}{P(\text{CS Professor}) + P(\text{Humanities Professor})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So, your answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
