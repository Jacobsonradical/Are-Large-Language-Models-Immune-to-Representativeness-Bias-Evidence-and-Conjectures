To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Rule. 

Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. **Total Professors**: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
2. **Prior Probability**: The prior probability (\(P(\text{CS})\)) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \). Similarly, the prior probability (\(P(\text{Hum})\)) that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
3. **Likelihood**: Descriptions are assumed to be equally likely to describe a computer science or humanities professor because no additional information is provided to suggest otherwise. Hence \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) = 1 \).
4. **Total Probability of Description**: 
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Hum}) \times P(\text{Hum}) \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = (1 \times 0.25) + (1 \times 0.75) = 1 
   \]

Now, applying Bayes' Rule:

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]
\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = 0.25 
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

Final answer:

{"probability": "0.25"}
