To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

We want to determine \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is from computer science, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Since no specific data is given about the likelihood of the description for either group (\( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|HU) \)), we assume these probabilities are approximately equal for simplicity, as there's no reason to believe otherwise from the problem statement alone.

So:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx P(D|HU) = x \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) = x \cdot 0.25 + x \cdot 0.75 = x \]

Thus, simplifying:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{x \cdot 0.25}{x} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
