To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. We're given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors. We need to calculate the probability that Jason belongs to the computer science group.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) = Event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) = Event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \(P(C | D)\) where \(D\) is the given description of Jason.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D | C)\) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \(P(C)\) = Number of computer science professors / Total number of professors = 25/100 = 0.25
- \(P(H)\) = Number of humanities professors / Total number of professors = 75/100 = 0.75

Assuming we have no additional information indicating that the description is more likely for one group over the other, we can assume \(P(D | C) = P(D | H)\). Thus:

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \(P(D | C) = P(D | H)\), let:
- \(P(D | C) = P(D | H) = p \)

Then:
\[ P(D) = p \cdot P(C) + p \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = p (P(C) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = p (0.25 + 0.75) = p \]

Given that:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p} \]
\[ P(C | D) = 0.25 \]

Thus the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
