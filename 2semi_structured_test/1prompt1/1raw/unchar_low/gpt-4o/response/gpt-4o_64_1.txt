To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to find the prior probability of being a computer science professor and the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Given:

- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities})\ = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Without specific likelihoods (i.e., data on how likely Jason's characteristics are to be seen in each group), we can simplify the problem by assuming a neutral stance where both groups have an equal probability of producing such a description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability as follows:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Given we assume the description is equally likely in both groups, \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \), making the equation:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
