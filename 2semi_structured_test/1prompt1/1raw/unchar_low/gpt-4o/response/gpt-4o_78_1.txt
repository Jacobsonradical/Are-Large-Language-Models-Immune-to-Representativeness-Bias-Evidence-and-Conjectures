To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (CS) is 25.
- The number of humanities professors (H) is 75.
- We have a description of a randomly chosen professor, Jason.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (CS) given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

However, since we have no additional specific information differentiating the description likelihood between CS and H aside from the fact he is a randomly selected professor from the pool of 100, we will assume the probability of the description given he is from either field is equal.

Thus, the probabilities can be directly calculated from the proportion of each group in the total sample.

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we are equally likely to pick any description:

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = \alpha \cdot 0.25 + \alpha \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = \alpha \]

Since \(\alpha\) cancels out in Bayes' theorem calculation when it is the same for both conditions:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
