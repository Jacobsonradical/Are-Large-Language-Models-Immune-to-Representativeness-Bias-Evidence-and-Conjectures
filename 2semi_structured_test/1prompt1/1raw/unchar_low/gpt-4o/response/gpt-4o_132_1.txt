To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem in this context is:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event corresponding to the description given.

First, let's define the components we need:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B | A) \): The likelihood of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \): The probability of the given description.

Since we have no specific distinction in the description to strongly indicate either field, we assume the likelihood \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | \neg A) \) (where \( \neg A \) means Jason is a humanities professor) are the same. Therefore, the prior probabilities are the main component to determine.

The total number of professors:
\[ n_{\text{total}} = 25 (\text{computer science}) + 75 (\text{humanities}) = 100 \]

Thus:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since \( P(B | A) \approx P(B | \neg A) \), we have:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

But \( P(B | A) = P(B | \neg A) \), so it simplifies to:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \]

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B | A)} = P(A) \]

Thus:

\[ P(A | B) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

Therefore, my answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
