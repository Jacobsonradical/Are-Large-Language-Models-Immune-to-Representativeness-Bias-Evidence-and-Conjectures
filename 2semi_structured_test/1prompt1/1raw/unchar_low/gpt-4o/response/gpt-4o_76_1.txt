To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the data given these probabilities.

Let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know the following:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is \( 25 + 75 = 100 \).

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ 
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, compute the prior probabilities:

\[ 
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

\[ 
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Assume that the descriptions are equally likely to be chosen regardless of the discipline. Thus:

\[ 
P(D|C) = P(D|H) = 1
\]

Since the description could be of any professor, the overall probability of the description \( P(D) \) is:

\[ 
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 = 1
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \(\boxed{25\%}\).

So, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
