To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, you can apply Bayes' theorem, which is used for calculating conditional probabilities.

Here's how you can break it down:

1. **Prior probability of being a computer science professor (P(CS))**:
   The number of computer science professors (CS) is 25.
   The total number of professors is 100.
   Therefore, the prior probability:
   \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Prior probability of being a humanities professor (P(HU))**:
   The number of humanities professors (HU) is 75.
   The total number of professors is 100.
   Therefore, the prior probability:
   \( P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (P(desc | CS))**:
   Unfortunately, the problem doesnâ€™t provide specific information to differentiate the likelihood of Jason's description being more likely for a CS professor versus a HU professor. So, we typically assume they are equally likely in the absence of additional details. Thus, we assume:
   \( P(desc | CS) = P(desc | HU) = 1 \)

4. **Total probability of the description (P(desc))**:
   Given that P(desc | CS) and P(desc | HU) are equally likely:
   \[
   P(desc) = P(desc | CS) \times P(CS) + P(desc | HU) \times P(HU)
   \]
   \[
   P(desc) = 1 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.75 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
   \]

5. **Posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (P(CS | desc))**:
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | desc) = \frac{P(desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(desc)}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS | desc) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{1} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.25.

The answer can be given in the required format:

{"probability": "0.25"}
