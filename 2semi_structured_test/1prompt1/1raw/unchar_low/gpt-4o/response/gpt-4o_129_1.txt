To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

- We know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description of Jason is picked at random.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We aim to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \( D \).

Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor: \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since the description is chosen at random, we will assume \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), meaning the description doesn't provide additional distinguishing information between the two groups apart from the proportional differences. Thus:
- \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \)
- \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)

Since \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot P(C) + k \cdot P(H) = k \cdot (P(C) + P(H)) \]

Since \( P(C) + P(H) = 1 \):
\[ P(D) = k \]

Given this, \( P(D|C) = k \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \{\text{probability}: "0.25" \} \]
