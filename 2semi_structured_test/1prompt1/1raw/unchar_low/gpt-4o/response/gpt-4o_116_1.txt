To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we do it:

1. **Total Professors**: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

2. **Initial Probabilities**:
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor at random (\(P(CS)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor at random (\(P(H) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Descriptions**: The problem states that a description is chosen at random, without providing specific likelihoods for each group. Hence, we assume that each professor has an equal chance of being described in this way.

Given no additional information favoring one group over the other based on the description, the likelihood of selecting a professor from either group based on the description remains proportional to the initial probabilities.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem, which in this context is simplified because the description does not provide additional differentiating information:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \) are both equally likely and thus cancel each other out.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the same for any chosen description out of the 100.

Thus, \( P(CS | \text{description}) = P(CS) \):

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
