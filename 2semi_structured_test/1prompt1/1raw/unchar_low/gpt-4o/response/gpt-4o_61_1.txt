To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. The aim is to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided. Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor,
- \(D\) as the given description of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We know the following:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability of picking a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Since we lack specific information on the description's likelihoods given specific fields, let's assume that the description \(D\) is equally likely for both groups. Consequently:
- \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\)

Given the description, the total probability \(P(D)\) can be calculated as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Under our assumption, if \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), they cancel out in the numerator and denominator:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.75 \]

So using the assumption \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = P(D|C) \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|C)} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description, is:
\[ \boxed{0.25} \]

Therefore, the answer is:
