To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(A|C) \), where \( C \) is the description of Jason.

Given:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since the description does not contain any specific information favoring either group (like specific interests or activities that are exclusive to one group), we assume \( P(C|A) = P(C|B) \). This means the description is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|C) = \frac{P(C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(C)} \]

Since \(P(C|A) = P(C|B)\),

\[ P(C) = P(C|A) \cdot P(A) + P(C|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Given \(P(C|A) = P(C|B)\),

\[ P(C) = P(C|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(B)) = P(C|A) \cdot 1 = P(C|A) \]

Thus,

\[ P(A|C) = \frac{P(C|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(C|A)} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25, or 25%. 

The answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
