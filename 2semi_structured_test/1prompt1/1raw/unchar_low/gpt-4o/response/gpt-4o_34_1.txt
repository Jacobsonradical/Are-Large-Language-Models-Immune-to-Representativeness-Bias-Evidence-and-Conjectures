To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the total number of professors**:
   - Computer Science professors (CS): 25
   - Humanities professors (H): 75
   - Total: 100

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(CS) \) = Probability a professor is from Computer Science = 25/100 = 0.25
   - \( P(H) \) = Probability a professor is from Humanities = 75/100 = 0.75

3. **Likelihood**:
   Since we need to simplify assumptions (e.g., assuming the descriptions are equally likely across both groups and no additional information discriminates between the groups):
   - \( P(\text{Description} | CS) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from Computer Science.
   - \( P(\text{Description} | H) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from Humanities.

   Assuming the description is equally likely for both groups \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), we don’t change our prior probabilities based on the description since there is no distinguishing factor provided in the description to prefer one group over another.

4. **Posterior probability** using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | H) P(H) \]

Given \( P(\text{Description} | CS) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), the denominator remains the same and only the priors matter.

Thus:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Since there's no differentiating information:
\[ P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(CS | \text{Description}) \) is:
