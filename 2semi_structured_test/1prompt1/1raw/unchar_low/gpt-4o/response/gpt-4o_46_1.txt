Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.

We are given:

- \( P(C) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a randomly selected professor is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

However, we are not provided with any specific probabilistic distinction between \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). In the absence of this specific information, we assume that the description is equally likely in either group. Therefore, we can claim \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \), and assuming \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]

So,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Given these calculations, my probability assessment is:
