In this problem, we need to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given his description. 

First, let's outline the numbers:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
Let \( B \) be the event that Jason is described as given.

We are asked to find the probability \( P(A|B) \).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Now, let's define the probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \) - The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(A^c) \) - The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description is general and does not provide specific characteristics that would skew towards either field, we will assume \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) to be reasonably similar.

Assume:
\[ P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \]

Since we need the total probability \( P(B) \) and the descriptions are assumed not to favor one group over the other, we can estimate \( P(B) \) as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Given that \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A^c) \), we can denote this common probability as \( P(B|common) \):
\[ P(B|common) = P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

Thus,
\[ P(B) = P(B|common) \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = P(B|common) \cdot 1 = P(B|common) \]

So, simplifying:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|common)} = \frac{P(B|common) \cdot 0.25}{P(B|common)} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
