To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
   - We are given that \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Given the Description:**
   - Since the description of Jason doesnâ€™t provide specific information about whether he is in computer science or humanities, we assume no bias in selecting his profile from either field.

3. **Use Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(H | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]

   Since the description provides no bias-specific details, we assume that \( P(\text{Description} | C) = P(\text{Description} | H) \).

4. **Simplify the Problem:**
   - Because \( P(\text{Description} | C) = P(\text{Description} | H) \), the denominator \( P(\text{Description}) \) will be equal for both events. Thus, it cancels out in the calculation.

5. **Final Probability:**
   \[
   P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)}
   \]
   \[
   P(C | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Given that the information about Jason does not provide additional distinguishing information regarding his field, the prior probabilities remain the same.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
