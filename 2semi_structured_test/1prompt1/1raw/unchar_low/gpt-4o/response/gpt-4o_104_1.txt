Given the description of Jason, we are dealing with an issue of conditional probability. You want to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor based on a description chosen at random. This can be approached using Bayes' Theorem.

1. **Prior Probability of Being a Computer Science Professor (P(CS))**:
   There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors. So, the prior probability is:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability of Being a Humanities Professor (P(H))**:
   There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors. So, the prior probability is:
   \[
   P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood**: This is where things can get a bit tricky because we donâ€™t have specific details about how likely it is for someone with Jason's description to be a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. However, since no additional distinctive information is provided and we're randomly selecting descriptions, we assume that the descriptions are equally likely to describe a professor from either field.

4. **Posterior Probability (P(CS|D))**: The goal is to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (denoted as D).

Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[
P(\text{CS|D}) = \frac{P(\text{D|CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{D})}
\]

We can simplify this given equal likelihoods of the description under either category:

Since:
\[
P(\text{D|Sci}) = P(\text{D|Hum})
\]

Bayes' Theorem essentially simplifies to using the prior probabilities directly because the ratio of likelihoods cancels out:

\[
P(\text{CS|D}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})}
\]

This is effectively just the proportion of computer science professors to the total number of professors:

\[
P(\text{CS|D}) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[
\{\text{"probability"}: "0.25"\}
\]
