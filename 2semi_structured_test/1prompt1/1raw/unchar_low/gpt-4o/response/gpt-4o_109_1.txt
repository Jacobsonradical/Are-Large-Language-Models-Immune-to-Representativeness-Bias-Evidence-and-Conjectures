To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let’s define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor

We also have the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the humanities = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We are given a description of Jason but no additional specific details that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors. Thus, we assume that the probability of being described in this specific way is equally likely across both groups. Therefore, \( P(\text{description} \mid A) \) and \( P(\text{description} \mid B) \) are both equal, and they cancel out in the Bayes' theorem equation.

According to Bayes’ theorem,

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) is the same regardless of whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor, it cancels out when considering the ratio:

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)}
\]

Given that \( P(A) = 0.25 \) and \( P(B) = 0.75 \):

\[
P(A \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
