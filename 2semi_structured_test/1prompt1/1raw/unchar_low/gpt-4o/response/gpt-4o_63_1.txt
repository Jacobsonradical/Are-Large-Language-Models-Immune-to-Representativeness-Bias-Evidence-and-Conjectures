To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description occurring if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

In this scenario:
- Let \( A \) be the event "Jason is a computer science professor".
- Let \( B \) be the event "the description fits Jason".

We know:
- The number of computer science professors = 25
- The number of humanities professors = 75
- The total number of professors = 100

Thus:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A') \), the probability that Jason is a humanities professor, is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Assuming that the description of Jason being high ability and well-liked is equally likely to occur among both computer science and humanities professors, we have \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \). Under this assumption, the probability of observing the description \( B \) is the same regardless of whether Jason is a computer science or a humanities professor.

Therefore:
- \( P(B|A) \) is some constant value \( k \).
- \( P(B|A') \) is the same constant value \( k \).

Given that the description doesn't provide specific differentiating details between the two groups, you can compute \( P(B) \) as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]

So, Bayes' theorem simplifies because the \( k \) terms will cancel out:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).

The answer is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
