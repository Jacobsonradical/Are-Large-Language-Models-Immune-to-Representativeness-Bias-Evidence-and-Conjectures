To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given information:
- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 25 + 75 = 100

We want to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly picked professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of getting such a description.

Given:
- \( P(CS) \) = \(\frac{25}{100}\) = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = \(\frac{75}{100}\) = 0.75

Assuming the description given is equally likely for both computer science and humanities professors (without additional specific information to distinguish), \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are equal:
- \( P(D|CS) \) = \( P(D|H) \)

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|CS) \) = \( P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|CS) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Then:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot 0.25}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample is:
