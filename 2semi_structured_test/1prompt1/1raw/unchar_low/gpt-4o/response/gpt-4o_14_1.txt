To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes’ Theorem. We want to find \( P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) \).

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since there is nothing in the description that strongly differentiates between computer science and humanities, we can assume that the likelihood of being a computer science or humanities professor given the description is the same for both groups.

Thus, we have:
- \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \)

By Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Here, \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups, so it cancels out in the ratio. Therefore:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} \mid \text{Description}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
