To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given that we have no other information besides the description and the sample sizes, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, a simpler approach is to compare the proportion of computer science professors to the proportion of humanities professors in the sample.

We have:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- A total of 100 professors

Using the proportion formula, the probability \( P(\text{Computer Science}) \) is the number of computer science professors divided by the total number of professors:

\[
P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{\text{Number of Computer Science Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\frac{1}{4}\) or 0.25.

Given the format requested:
