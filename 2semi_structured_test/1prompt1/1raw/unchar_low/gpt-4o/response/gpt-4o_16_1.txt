To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. Let's denote the events:

- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we need to define some probabilities:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let \( D \) denote the description given for Jason. We need to find:

- \( P(CS | D) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we don't have specific details indicating differences in descriptions between computer science and humanities professors, we assume \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) are the same. Therefore, we simplify this to:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Given no specific distinguishing information in the description provided, we rely purely on the base rates of professors in each field.

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \left\{ "probability": "0.25" \right\} \]
