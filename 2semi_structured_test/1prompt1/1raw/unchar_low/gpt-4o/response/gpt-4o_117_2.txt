To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimates given new information.

Let \( CS \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
Let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability)

We need to find \( P(CS | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Similarly, we need:
\[ P(H | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{description})} \]

The overall probability of the description, \( P(\text{description}) \), can be computed as:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since we don't have specific details on the descriptions and how likely they are to fit either group, we'll assume they are equally likely to fit any professor in either group. This means \( P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \).

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]

If \( P(\text{description} | CS) = P(\text{description} | H) \), they cancel out in the calculation of the numerator and the denominator.

So the simplified formula boils down to the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\boxed{0.25}\).

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
