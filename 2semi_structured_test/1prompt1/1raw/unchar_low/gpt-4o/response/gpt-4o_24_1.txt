First, let's calculate the base rates for the professors in computer science and the humanities:

- Number of computer science professors: 25
- Number of humanities professors: 75
- Total number of professors: 100

The probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly from the sample is:

\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly from the sample is:

\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Without additional information specific to Jason's traits that would differentiate between computer science professors and humanities professors, we rely on these base rates. Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = P(\text{CS}) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:
