To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(C_1\): Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \(C_2\): Jason is one of the humanities professors.
- \(E\): The event refers to the description we have of Jason.

We want to compute \(P(C_1|E)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- The total number of professors is 100 (25 in computer science and 75 in humanities).
- \(P(C_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(C_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need \(P(E|C_1)\) and \(P(E|C_2)\):
- \(P(E|C_1)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(E|C_2)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since we have no specific information in the description that differentiates between the fields and assuming the description is equally likely irrespective of the field, we can reasonably assume:
- \(P(E|C_1) = P(E|C_2)\)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C_1|E) = \frac{P(E|C_1) \cdot P(C_1)}{P(E)}
\]

Since \(P(E) = P(E|C_1) \cdot P(C_1) + P(E|C_2) \cdot P(C_2)\), and assuming \(P(E|C_1) = P(E|C_2)\), we have:
\[
P(E) = P(E|C_1) \cdot P(C_1) + P(E|C_2) \cdot P(C_2) \\
= P(E|C_1) \cdot (P(C_1) + P(C_2)) \\
= P(E|C_1) \cdot 1
\]

Substituting \(P(E)\) back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(C_1|E) = \frac{P(E|C_1) \cdot P(C_1)}{P(E|C_1) \cdot 1} \\
= P(C_1)
\]

Thus:
\[
P(C_1|E) = P(C_1) = 0.25
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
