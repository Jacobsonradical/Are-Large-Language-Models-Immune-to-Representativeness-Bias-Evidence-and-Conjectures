To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

We have the following information:
- The total number of professors in the study is 100.
- 25 of these professors are in computer science (CS), and 75 are in the humanities.

Let's define the following events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Jason's description.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, we need to estimate the prior probabilities:
- \(P(C)\): The prior probability of being a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of being a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Since the description does not contain any specific information that discriminates between CS and humanities professors, we assume that the likelihood of the description \(D\) being representative of either group is equally likely:

- \(P(D|C)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\approx 1\).
- \(P(D|H)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\approx 1\).

Now we compute the total probability of the description, \(P(D)\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.25 + 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
