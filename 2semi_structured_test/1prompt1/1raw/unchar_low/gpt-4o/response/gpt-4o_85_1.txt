To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( C \) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) = Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), where \( D \) is the given description.

From the study, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Without loss of generality, we assume that Jason's description is equally likely for a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

If the description is equally likely to describe someone from either group, the likelihood of the description \( D \) given each profession is the same (this simplifies calculation, as it cancels out):

\[ P(D|C) = P(D|H) \]
\[ \text{Therefore, } P(D|C) = P(D|H) = k \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Since we know:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

And considering \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75 = k \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, is:
