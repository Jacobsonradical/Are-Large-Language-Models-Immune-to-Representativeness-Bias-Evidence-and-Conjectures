To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This can be done based on the proportion of computer science and humanities professors in the sample, as well as the assumption that the given description does not favor one group over the other.

Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of Jason’s description if he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

Given the proportions:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of the total 100 professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors out of the total 100 professors.

Thus, \(P(A)\), the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, is:

\[
P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

The probability \(P(B|A)\) represents the probability of Jason’s description, but given no biases in the description, it’s assumed equally likely for both disciplines:

\[
P(B|CS) = P(B|H)
\]

So, the denominator \(P(B)\) is:

\[
P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given \(P(B|CS)\) is assumed equal to \(P(B|H)\), the total probability of Jason’s description \(P(B)\) simplifies to be a direct proportion:

\[
P(B) = (P(B|CS) + P(B|H)) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS + H)
\]

Thus simplifying, it remains tied, and we revisit the prior probability assessment only:

\[
\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = P(A) \sim 0.25
\]
Thus, the probability Jason is in computer science:

\[
{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
