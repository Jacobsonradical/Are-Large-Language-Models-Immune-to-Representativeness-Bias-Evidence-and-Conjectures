To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we do it step by step:

1. **Total Professors (n):** There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.

2. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(\text{Computer Science}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihoods:** Assuming the description of Jason provides similar information for each group (no information skew favoring one field):
   - \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \)

4. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**

Since the description does not give us specific information favoring one domain over the other, the likelihoods would be roughly equal. Hence, we predominantly rely on the priors.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

where,

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \times P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Given that \( P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \approx P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \),

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) \approx \frac{P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Computer Science}) + P(\text{Humanities})} \]

Since \( P(\text{Description}) \) cancels out whether Jason is from Computer Science or Humanities,

\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) \approx P(\text{Computer Science}) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
