To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem requires two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
2. The likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Here we know the following:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description provided does not indicate any difference between the likelihoods of being a computer science or a humanities professor.

Given that we have one description chosen at random and no other differentiating information provided in the description, we can use the prior probabilities:

- The number of computer science professors: \( 25 \)
- The number of humanities professors: \( 75 \)
- The total number of professors: \( 100 \)

Therefore, the prior probability for Jason being a computer science professor is simply the proportion of computer science professors in the total sample:

\[ P(\text{CS Professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities Professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since the description is assumed to be equally likely for any professor, the likelihood ratio is \( 1:1 \). Thus, the posterior probability of Jason being a computer science professor is the same as the prior probability.

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ \text{{Probability}} = 0.25 \]

So, the answer to the question is:

```{"probability": "0.25"}```
