To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. In this context, we need to calculate the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given his description.

First, let's outline the information:

- The probability of choosing a computer science professor randomly from the total sample (prior probability for computer science) is 
  \[
  P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

- The probability of choosing a humanities professor randomly from the total sample (prior probability for humanities) is 
  \[
  P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

Since we have no other specific information indicating a difference in the likelihood of the description given, we'll treat the description frequency as the same for both groups. Therefore the description likelihood (\( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) and \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \)) can be assumed to be equivalent.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
\]

Since \(P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{H})\) by our assumption and they cancel out in the ratio, what remains is the ratio of the priors:

\[
P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is:

\[
\text{"probability"}: "0.25"
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
