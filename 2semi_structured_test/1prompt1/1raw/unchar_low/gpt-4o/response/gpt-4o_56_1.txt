To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the base rates (prior probabilities) and assume that the description provided is equally likely for both groups of professors.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   
   Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS)) is:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   And the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor (P(H)) is:
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   We're told nothing specific in the description that makes the description more or less likely for a professor in either field. Therefore, we'll assume the likelihood of this description is the same for both fields.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (D) is:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are considered equally likely:
\[
P(D|CS) = P(D|H)
\]

The combined likelihood \(P(D)\):
\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Both \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are the same, so \(P(D) = k \cdot 0.25 + k \cdot 0.75\) where \(k\) is the common likelihood term. This simplifies to:
\[
P(D) = k \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) = k \cdot 1 = k
\]

Thus,
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{k \cdot 0.25}{k} = 0.25
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.25"}
\]
