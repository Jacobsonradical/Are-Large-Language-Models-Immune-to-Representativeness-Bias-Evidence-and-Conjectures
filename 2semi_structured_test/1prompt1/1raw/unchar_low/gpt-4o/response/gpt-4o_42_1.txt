To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Here is how we can set it up:

1. **Prior probability (P(A)):** This is the probability that a professor chosen at random is a computer science professor.
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, P(Computer Science Professor) = 25/100 = 0.25.

2. **Complement probability (P(B)):** This is the probability that a professor chosen at random is a humanities professor.
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
   - So, P(Humanities Professor) = 75/100 = 0.75.

3. **Likelihood (P(D|A)):** This is the probability of the description given the professor is a computer science professor.
4. **Complement Likelihood (P(D|B)):** This is the probability of the description given the professor is a humanities professor.

Without any additional specific information that differentiates Jason between the groups beyond the general description, we will assume that the description is equally likely for both groups.

- So, P(D | Computer Science Professor) = P(D | Humanities Professor) = 1 because the description does not favor either group specifically.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(Computer Science|D) = \frac{P(D|Computer Science) \cdot P(Computer Science)}{P(D)} \]

Since P(D) is the same for both computer science and humanities professors, it's proportional to the prior probabilities:

\[ P(Computer Science|D) = \frac{P(Computer Science)}{P(Computer Science) + P(Humanities)} \]

Replacing the values:

\[ P(Computer Science|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1.00} = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is:
