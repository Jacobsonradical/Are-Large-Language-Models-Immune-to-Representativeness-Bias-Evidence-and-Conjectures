To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the prior probabilities:**
   - The probability of selecting a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability of selecting a humanities professor (\(P(H))\) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Estimate the likelihoods:**
   - Since the description is randomly chosen and does not give any specific information favoring one group over the other, we assume the description is equally likely for both groups. Thus, the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D \mid CS)\)) is equal to the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D \mid H)\)).

Given our assumptions, we can simplify using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since \(P(D \mid CS) = P(D \mid H)\),

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

However, we can directly compute the probability using the ratio of priors given equal likelihoods:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.

Hence, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
