To compute the probability, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the process:

1. **Total Number of Professors**: 25 computer science (CS) professors + 75 humanities professors = 100 professors.
2. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a professor is from computer science (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability that a professor is from the humanities (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

3. **Likelihood**: We need to consider the likelihood of the given description for both groups. Since we don't have specific likelihood data, we assume that having the described traits (high ability, strong motivation, positive reputation) is equally likely for professors in both groups.

4. **Posterior Probability**: We want \(P(CS | D)\), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (\(D\)).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D | CS)\) is the probability of the description given a computer science professor.
- \(P(D | H)\) is the probability of the description given a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the overall probability of the description.

Given that we assume \(P(D | CS)\) and \(P(D | H)\) to be equal, thus \(P(D)\) would be the sum of the weighted probabilities:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
Since \(P(D | CS) = P(D | H)\), \(P(D)\) simplifies to:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS + H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \]

Therefore, the most critical aspect comes down to the prior probabilities since the likelihoods cancel out if they are assumed equal.

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]
Given:
\[ P(CS) = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = 0.75 \]

Thus the final posterior probability is simplified to:
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
