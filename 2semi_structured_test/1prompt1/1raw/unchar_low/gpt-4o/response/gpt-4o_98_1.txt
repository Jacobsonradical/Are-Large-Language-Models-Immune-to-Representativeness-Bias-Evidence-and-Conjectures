To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, given that we have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

The probability \( P(CS) \) that Jason is a computer science professor out of the total sample:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor out of the total sample:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, considering that we don't have any additional distinguishing information other than the general description, we assume the description has equal likelihood for professors in both fields (i.e., not more commonly describing someone from one discipline over the other). 

Thus, given the assumption that Jason could belong equally to either group based on the available information:

\[ P(H_j|CS) = P(H_j|H) \]

We use the probabilities directly as the ratios of the groups:

The probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample would be:

\[ P(CS|H_j) = \frac{P(H_j|CS)P(CS)}{P(H_j)} \]

Since \( P(H_j|CS) = P(H_j|H) \):

\[ P(CS|H_j) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

The final probability is:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

Thus:

{"probability": "0.25"}
