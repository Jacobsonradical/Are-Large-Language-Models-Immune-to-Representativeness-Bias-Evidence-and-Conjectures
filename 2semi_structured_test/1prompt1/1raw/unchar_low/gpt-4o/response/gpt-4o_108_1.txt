To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the study sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability we want to compute, i.e., the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:

\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description provided is equally likely for both groups (as no specific bias is mentioned), \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|H) \) are both 1, as the description matches any of the descriptions randomly chosen from either group:

Since \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|H) \approx 1 \):

The total probability \( P(B) \) is the sum of the likelihoods for both groups, weighted by their respective probabilities:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) ≈ 1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) ≈ 0.25 + 0.75  \]
\[ P(B) ≈ 1  \]

Therefore:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1} = 0.25  \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.25 \).

Hence, the probability is:
