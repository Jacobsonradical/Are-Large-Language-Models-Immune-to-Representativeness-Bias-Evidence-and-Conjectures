To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here’s the breakdown of the computation:

- We know there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the probability of selecting a professor from computer science (P(CS)) is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The probability of selecting a professor from the humanities (P(H)) is 75/100 = 0.75.

For simplicity, we assume that the description provided doesn’t bias towards either discipline, implying that Jason's traits are equally likely for professors from both fields. Thus:

- The probability of getting a description like Jason's given that the professor is from computer science (P(D|CS)) = P(D|H), the probability of getting the description if the professor is from humanities.

Then by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since we assume P(D|CS) = P(D|H), and considering that the total probability of the description P(D) is the weighted sum of these:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given P(D|CS) = P(D|H), this simplifies to:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]

Hence, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{\{"probability": "0.25"\}} \]

Thus:
