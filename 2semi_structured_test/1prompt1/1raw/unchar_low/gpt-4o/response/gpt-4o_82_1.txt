To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. In this scenario:

- \( A \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The description provided, which matches Jason.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**: This is the probability that any randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: This is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Since we have no specific details suggesting otherwise, we'll assume the description is equally likely for professors from either discipline.
   \[ P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**: This is the probability of the description matching any professor.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   Given our assumption that \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), this simplifies to:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot (P(A) + P(A^c)) = P(B|A) \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, because \( P(B|A) \) is the same for both groups, we essentially revert to the prior probability:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = P(A) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.25"}} \]
