To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is one of the computer science professors.
- \(B\) is the description that we have about Jason.

First, let's define our individual probabilities:
- \(P(A)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|A)\): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\): The overall probability of the description.

Given the information:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

The prior probability \(P(A)\) can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor \(P(A')\) is:
\[ P(A') = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming the description of Jason does not offer a large bias towards either group, we consider \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|A')\) to be similar. In this case, the description does not provide any distinguishing features that imply Jason is more likely in one group over the other, so they could reasonably be treated as equal.

Therefore the overall probability \(P(B)\) of the description is:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
Given our assumption \(P(B|A) \approx P(B|A')\), let's denote this common value as \(k\):
\[ P(B) = k \times P(A) + k \times P(A') = k \times (P(A) + P(A')) = k \times 1 = k \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{k \times 0.25}{k} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
