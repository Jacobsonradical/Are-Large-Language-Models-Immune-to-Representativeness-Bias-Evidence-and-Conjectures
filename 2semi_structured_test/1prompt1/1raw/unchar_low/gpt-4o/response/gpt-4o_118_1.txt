To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information and the computation:

1. There are 25 computer science professors (C) and 75 humanities professors (H).
2. The total number of professors (T) is 100.
3. We are given a description of a professor (Jason) and need to find the probability that Jason is from the computer science group given his description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} \) or 0.25.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Since the description is chosen randomly and there is no specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, it is reasonable to assume \( P(D|C) \) is equal to \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Thus, \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
Since \( P(D|C) \) is equal to \( P(D|H) \), we can denote it as \( P(D) \).

Given \( P(D|C) = P(D|H) \), we can simplify the problem to focus on the priors:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} \]
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Thus:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
