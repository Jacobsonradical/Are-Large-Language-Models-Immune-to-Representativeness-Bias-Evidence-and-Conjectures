To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor, and \( B \) be the event that a randomly chosen professor (with the provided description) fits the description. 

Given:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability of selecting a computer science professor from the sample = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) \) = Probability of selecting a humanities professor from the sample = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Though we don't have specific probabilities associated with the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we need to proceed with the information available.

Since we have no basis for believing the provided description is more likely to fit one group than the other, we assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), meaning the description is equally likely for professors in both domains.

Then:
\( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \)

Using these equal likelihoods, Bayes' theorem simplifies to computing the prior probabilities, because the likelihoods cancel out:

Therefore,
\( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(A)P(B|A) + P(A^c)P(B|A^c)} \)
Given \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), this simplifies to:
\( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \)

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
