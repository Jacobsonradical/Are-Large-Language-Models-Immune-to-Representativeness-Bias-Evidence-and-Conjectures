To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll check how likely it is that someone with Jason's traits is from the group of computer science professors compared to the same traits in the humanities professors.

We need to define the following probabilities:
- \(P(CS)\): The prior probability of a professor being from computer science.
- \(P(Hum)\): The prior probability of a professor being from humanities.
- \(P(Jason | CS)\): The likelihood of a professor like Jason given that he is from computer science.
- \(P(Jason | Hum)\): The likelihood of a professor like Jason given that he is from humanities.
- \(P(Jason)\): The overall probability of selecting someone like Jason.

We use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)} \]

Given that the description of Jason doesn't provide specific information that greatly distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors, we assume \(P(Jason | CS)\) is approximately equal to \(P(Jason | Hum)\). 

Starting with the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We assume that the likelihood \(P(Jason | CS) \) and \( P(Jason | Hum)\) are roughly equal, so they cancel out in our Bayes' equation:

\[ P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
