To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of receiving Jason's description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science, \( P(A) \):
  \[ P(\text{CS professor}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities, \( P(\text{Humanities professor}) \):
  \[ P(\text{Humanities professor}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we don't have specific information about how likely such a description is to come from a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we will assume that the likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are the same. Therefore, these values cancel out in Bayes' Theorem, yielding:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} \]

Where \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that a professor is not from computer science (i.e., from the humanities):
\[ P(\neg A) = 0.75 \]

Thus the equation simplifies to:

\[ P(\text{CS professor given description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]

\[ P(\text{CS professor given description}) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
