To begin with, let's outline the information given:

1. There are 100 total tenured professors in the sample.
2. 25 of these professors are from computer science.
3. 75 of these professors are from the humanities.

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given no additional information beyond his description. This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem in the context of probability.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

However, since we don't have further distinguishing information in the description, we can simplify this problem by considering the proportions directly.

Given:
- The probability of picking a computer science professor from the sample, \( P(CS) \), is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of picking a humanities professor from the sample, \( P(H) \), is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description provided does not give us any specific information that favors computer science or humanities professors, we assume the description is equally likely to describe a professor from either group. Therefore, we would base our probability calculation solely on the proportions.

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ P(CS) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
