To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayesian probability is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is Jason's description fitting the given profile (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and positive reputation).

From the problem statement:
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor ( \( P(\text{CS}) \) ): There are 25 computer science professors out of 100, so \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor ( \( P(\text{Hum}) \) ): There are 75 humanities professors out of 100, so \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information on how likely each of the computer science or humanities professors are to fit the description (assuming high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, and positive reputation is equally probable among both groups), we assume:

\[ P(B|CS) = P(B|Hum) \]

Given no specific information differentiating the two groups based on the description, these can be considered equal:

\[ P(B|CS) = P(B|Hum) = 1 \]

This simplifies to using the base rates directly:

\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.25.
