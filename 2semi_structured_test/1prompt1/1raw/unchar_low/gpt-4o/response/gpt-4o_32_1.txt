To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. The information given provides the necessary counts of professors in each field: 25 in computer science and 75 in the humanities, making a total of 100 professors.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the given description of Jason.

We want to determine \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

First, let's compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming that the description \( D \) is equally likely for professors in both fields (i.e., Jason's description does not specifically indicate computer science or humanities over the other), we can say:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \)

Therefore, under the assumption that \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \), Bayes' theorem simplifies to:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} \]

Using the prior probabilities:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.25"}
