To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We are interested in \(P(C | D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\). 

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need the following probabilities:
- \(P(C)\): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|C)\): the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): the total probability of the description.

Since the description doesn't give specific information that distinguishes between computer science and humanities professors (i.e., it describes traits common to both groups), let's assume \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\). It's a simplifying assumption given the generic nature of the description.

Given the sample sizes:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Let’s assume each professor has an equal chance of being described.

Thus:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Using our assumption:
- \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\)

We can find \(P(D)\) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot 0.25 + P(D|H) \cdot 0.75 \]
Since \(P(D|C) = P(D|H)\), let’s denote this common probability as \(p\):
\[ P(D) = p \cdot 0.25 + p \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = p(0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = p \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
