To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of Jason's description being chosen at random from any professor in the sample.
- \( P(CS|D) \): The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

First, let's calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since we do not have any specific distinguishing characteristics in the description pointing to one field or the other, we can assume that the description is equally likely for a professor from either field. Thus, we can set:
- \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \)

By the law of total probability, \( P(D) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS)P(CS) + P(D|H)P(H) \]

Since \( P(D|CS) = P(D|H) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|CS) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot (P(CS) + P(H)) \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot 1 \]
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \]

Now, we need the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Since \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = P(CS) \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
