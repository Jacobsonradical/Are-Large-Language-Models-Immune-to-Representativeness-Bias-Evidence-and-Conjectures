To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach to find the probability:

1. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a professor is from computer science: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) \) = Probability that a professor is from the humanities: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. Since we are given a description but no specific distinguishing details that differentiate between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the likelihood of the description given the subject's field is equal. Thus,
   - \( P(Description | CS) = P(Description | H) = 1 \)

3. Use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:
   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Description)}
   \]
   Since \( P(Description) \) is the same for both fields, we can simplify this to:

   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
   \]
   Given that the likelihoods \( P(Description | CS) \) and \( P(Description | H) \) cancel out. This simplifies to:

   \[
   P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
