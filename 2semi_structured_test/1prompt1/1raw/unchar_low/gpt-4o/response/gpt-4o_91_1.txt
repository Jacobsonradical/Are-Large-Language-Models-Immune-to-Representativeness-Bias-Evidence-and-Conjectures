To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

We are given:
- 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science
- 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities
- One description chosen at random from the 100 available descriptions

First, let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \) as the provided description of Jason

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Here:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

Since the descriptions were selected randomly,
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Now, since we have no specific information that the description is more likely to belong to either a computer science professor or a humanities professor (because the description is chosen uniformly at random),
\[ P(D | C) = P(D | H) = \frac{1}{100} \]

Note that:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
So,
\[ P(D) = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \cdot 25 + \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \cdot 75 \]
\[ P(D) = \frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100} \]
\[ P(D) = 1 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{25}{100}\right)}{1} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{25}{10000} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
