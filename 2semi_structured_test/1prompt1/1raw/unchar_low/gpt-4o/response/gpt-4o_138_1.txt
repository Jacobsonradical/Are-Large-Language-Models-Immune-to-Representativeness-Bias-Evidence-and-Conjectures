Given that Jason's description was chosen at random from the pool of 100 professors (25 of whom are computer science professors and 75 of whom are humanities professors), and we have no evidence suggesting higher or lower similarity between his description and either group, we should start with the base rate of computer science professors in the sample.

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor can be computed using the ratio of computer science professors to the total number of professors in the study:

\[ P(\text{Computer science professor}) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Hence, the probability is 0.25.
