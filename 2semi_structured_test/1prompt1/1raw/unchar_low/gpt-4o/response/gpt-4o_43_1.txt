To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's set up the prior probabilities and our likelihoods.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the study:
- The number of computer science professors (\( P(A) \)) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (\( P(B) \)) = 75

The total number of professors in the sample is 100.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since the description of Jason does not provide specific information that differentiates between a computer science and humanities professor beyond the general characteristics (high ability, strong motivation, well-liked, positive reputation), we assume that the likelihood of receiving this description is the same for both groups.

Thus:
- \( P(description|A) = P(description|B) \)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|description) = \frac{P(description|A) \times P(A)}{P(description)} \]

Since \( P(description|A) \) and \( P(description|B) \) are equally likely, we can simplify \( P(description) \):
\[ P(description) = P(description|A) \times P(A) + P(description|B) \times P(B) \]

Thus, given that \( P(description|A) \) and \( P(description|B) \) cancel out:
\[ P(A|description) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{\ "probability\": "0.25"}
