To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We know the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The total number of professors is 100.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

To simplify, without additional information on the likelihood of having such a description (which we assume is equally likely across both groups given no contrary info), we use the base rates directly:

- \( P(A) \) = Probability Jason is a computer science professor = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) = Probability Jason is a humanities professor = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Given that we have no additional distinguishing information between the groups:

- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability of the description if a computer science professor = same for both = 1
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) = Probability of the description if a humanities professor = same for both = 1

The formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Simplifies to:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(\neg A)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} \]

So the probability is:

\[ \boxed{0.25} \]

Given the format requested for the answer:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]

Thus:
\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
