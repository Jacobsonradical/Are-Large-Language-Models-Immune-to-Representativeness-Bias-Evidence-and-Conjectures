First, we can apply Bayes' theorem to compute the probability. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that event A occurs given that event B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that event B occurs given that event A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the characteristics described (ability, motivation, positive reputation, etc.).

To find \( P(A|B) \), we'd need to know the probabilities \( P(B|A) \), \( P(A) \), and \( P(B) \). 

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \)

Assume the characteristics are equally likely among both groups (since no specific distinction is provided), making:
- \( P(B|A) \approx P(B|A') \)

Thus, the probability of selecting a professor with the characteristics described (\( P(B) \)) would reflect the overall composition:
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A') \):
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \cdot 0.25 + P(B|A) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) \approx P(B|A) \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot 0.25}{P(B)} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.25"} \]

So the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.25"}
```
