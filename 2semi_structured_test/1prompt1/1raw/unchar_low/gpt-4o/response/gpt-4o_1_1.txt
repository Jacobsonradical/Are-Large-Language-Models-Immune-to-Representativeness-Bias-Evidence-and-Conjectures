To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new information.

We are given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample, making the total number of professors 100. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The description of Jason does not provide any specific information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors. Therefore, the likelihoods of receiving this description given that Jason is either a computer science professor or a humanities professor can be considered equal:

- \( P(description|CS) = P(description|H) \)

As a result, the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is proportional to the prior probability. 

The formula for Bayes' theorem in this scenario simplifies to:

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(description|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Since \( P(description|CS) = P(description|H) \), they cancel out, and we are left with:

\[ P(CS|description) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
