To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( C \): Jason is a tenured professor in computer science
- \( H \): Jason is a tenured professor in the humanities

We need to compute \( P(C \mid D) \), where \( D \) represents the description given for Jason.

First, we'll need the following probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming the description \( D \) does not favor one group over the other (the description seems quite general), the likelihoods \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \) should be approximately the same. Therefore,

- \( P(D \mid C) \approx P(D \mid H) \)

Given no additional information to differentiate, we assume these are equal. Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Since \( P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \) and the likelihoods are equal, they cancel out in the calculation:

\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
\]

Therefore,
