To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Number of Professors**:
   - Total professors = 100
   - Computer Science Professors (CS) = 25
   - Humanities Professors (H) = 75

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood**:
   The description given for Jason appears to be equally typical for professors in both fields, as nothing specific to either field is mentioned.

   Therefore, we can assume:
   \[
   P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid H)
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability Calculation** using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]
   Where \( P(\text{description}) \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} \mid H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Given that \( P(\text{description} \mid CS) = P(\text{description} \mid H) \), the terms cancel out:

   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(CS)}{P(CS) + P(H)}
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25
   \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{\text{"probability": "0.25"}}
\]
