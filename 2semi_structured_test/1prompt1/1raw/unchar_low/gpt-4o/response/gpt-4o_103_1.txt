To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, 
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason fits the given description.

First, we find the prior probabilities:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assuming that the descriptions are equally likely to come from either group (since the problem does not specify otherwise), we assume:

\[ P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = 1 \]

Now, we want:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting in the values we assumed:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{1 \cdot 0.25 + 1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
