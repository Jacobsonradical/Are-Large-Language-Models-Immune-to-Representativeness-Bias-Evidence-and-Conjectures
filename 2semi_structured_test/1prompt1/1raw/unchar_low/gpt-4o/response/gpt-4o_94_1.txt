To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- Number of computer science professors (CS) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 75
- Total number of professors = 100

We need to find the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.

First, we consider the prior probabilities:
- The probability of a professor being from computer science (P(CS)) is 25/100 = 0.25
- The probability of a professor being from the humanities (P(H)) is 75/100 = 0.75

Without additional data on how likely a given description is to match a computer science professor versus a humanities professor, we assume that the description "high ability and strong motivation" is equally likely for both groups. This simplifies our calculation to only depend on the prior probabilities.

The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor (P(CS | description)) can be found using:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Since we assumed descriptions are equally likely for both groups:
\[ P(description | CS) = P(description | H) \]

Thus:
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ = P(description | CS) \cdot 0.25 + P(description | CS) \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ = P(description | CS) \cdot (0.25 + 0.75) \]
\[ = P(description | CS) \cdot 1 \]
\[ = P(description | CS) \]

We conclude:
\[ P(CS | description) = P(CS) \]
\[ P(CS | description) = 0.25 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is 0.25.

Therefore, the answer is: {"probability": "0.25"}
