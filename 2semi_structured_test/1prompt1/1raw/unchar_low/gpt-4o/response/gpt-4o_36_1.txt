To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- B: The provided description fits Jason.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description B given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description B.

Given that the description is chosen randomly from the 100 available descriptions, we need to make some assumptions about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) (where \( A^c \) is the complement event that Jason is not a computer science professor, i.e., he is a humanities professor). Because we lack specific differences in how descriptions are written for professors of different disciplines, we can assume \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \). This implies the description is equally likely to be given to a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Thus, we simplify Bayes' theorem to Just use the ratios of the groups. 

1. \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor)
2. \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \) (prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor)

Since \( P(B|A) = P(B|A^c) \), these cancel out and we only need to compare the priors:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A) + P(A^c)} \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description is 0.25 or 25%.
