First, let's apply some principles of probability and Bayes' Theorem.

We have two groups of professors: 25 computer science (CS) professors and 75 humanities professors, totaling 100 professors.

The probability that Jason is a CS professor given the provided description can be calculated by using Bayes' Theorem, accounting for the prior probabilities and likelihoods:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability of being a CS professor (\(P(CS)\)): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(Hum)\)): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The provided description does not specify characteristics unique to either group, so we can assume that the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in either group is similar, around the same medium of common academic traits like high ability, motivation, and likability.

Assuming no additional specific information that differentiates a CS professor from a humanities professor in the description, the likelihood terms \(P(description | CS)\) and \(P(description | Hum)\) can be assumed to be equal or cancel each other out.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Assuming \( P(description | CS) \approx P(description | Hum) \):

\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ = k \cdot P(CS) + k \cdot P(Hum) \]
\[ = k ( P(CS) + P(Hum) ) \]
\[ = k \cdot 1 \]
\[ = k \]

Thus,

\[ P(CS | description) \approx \frac{k \cdot P(CS)} {k} \]
\[ = P(CS) \]
\[ = 0.25 \]

Given the constraints and provided information, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is simply:
