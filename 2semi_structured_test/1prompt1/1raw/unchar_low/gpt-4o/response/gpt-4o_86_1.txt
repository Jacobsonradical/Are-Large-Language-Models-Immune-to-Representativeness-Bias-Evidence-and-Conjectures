To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we will use Bayes' Theorem.

We start with the following information:
- We have 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
- Each description is equally likely to be chosen.

We need to find the probability \( P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Since descriptions are chosen at random and there is no additional information to differentiate the likelihood of the description belonging to a computer science professor versus a humanities professor specifically, we assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \).

Given the count:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}) \) is the same for both groups because the description is chosen at random.

Since \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \),

We simplify Bayes' Theorem to:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Humanities})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
