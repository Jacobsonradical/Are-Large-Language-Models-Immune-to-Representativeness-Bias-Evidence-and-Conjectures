To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - There are 25 tenured and successful professors in computer science.
   - There are 75 tenured and successful professors in the humanities.
   - Total professors: 25 + 75 = 100.
   - Prior probability (P(Computer Science)) = 25/100 = 0.25.
   - Prior probability (P(Humanities)) = 75/100 = 0.75.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - This is the probability of observing Jason's description if he is in computer science or humanities. However, since we don't have specific information distinguishing Jason's field based on his description, we'll assume that the descriptions are equally likely across both fields.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - P(Computer Science | Description) is what we want to find.
   - Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In our context:
- P(Description | Computer Science) = P(Description | Humanities) since descriptions are assumed equally likely.
- P(Description) = Total number of ways to draw Jason's description from both groups.

Using Bayes' formula:
\[ P(Computer Science | Description) = \frac{P(Description | Computer Science) * P(Computer Science)}{P(Description)} \]

Since P(Description | Computer Science) is equal to P(Description | Humanities) and they cancel each other out:

\[ P(Computer Science | Description) = P(Computer Science) = 0.25 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
