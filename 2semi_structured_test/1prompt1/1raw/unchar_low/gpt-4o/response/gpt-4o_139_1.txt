To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Since the prior probabilities are equal (each description is equally likely to be chosen), we'll use the ratios of the sample sizes directly.

Given:
- 25 computer science professors
- 75 humanities professors
- Jason can be from either group

The prior probabilities are:
- P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25 (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science)
- P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 (Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities)

Jason’s description doesn’t provide specific information that differentiates the two groups (e.g., stereotypical traits unique to computer scientists or humanities professors). Thus, we can proceed directly to state the proportion based on the prior probabilities.

By Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason’s description}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason’s description} | \text{CS}) * P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason’s description})} \]

Since Jason’s description (being well-liked, high ability, strong motivation, etc.) is equally probable in both groups and does not discriminate between them, P(Jason’s description | CS) is effectively the same as P(Jason’s description | H).

Thus, the probability simplifies to the ratio of the sizes of the groups:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{Jason's description}) = \frac{P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{H})} = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.75} = \frac{0.25}{1} = 0.25 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ {"probability": "0.25"} \]
