To determine the conditional probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor and \( B \) as the event of reading Jason's description.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is in computer science given his description. To do that, we need the following:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is from computer science.
3. \( P(B) \): The probability of the description.

We know that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors among the subjects:

\( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

Since the description does not distinguish between different fields and assumes no bias, we assume that the descriptions are equally likely across both fields:

\( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) \)

Where \( \neg A \) denotes Jason being from the humanities.

Since the descriptions are assumed equally likely:

\( P(B|A) = P(B|\neg A) = \frac{1}{100} \)

Now, \( P(B) \) can be calculated considering both cases (Jason from computer science and Jason from humanities):

\( P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|\neg A) * P(\neg A) \)

Substituting \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \):

\( P(B) = \frac{1}{100} * 0.25 + \frac{1}{100} * 0.75 \)
\( P(B) = \frac{0.25}{100} + \frac{0.75}{100} \)
\( P(B) = \frac{1}{100} \)

Thus:

\( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \)
\( P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{100} * 0.25}{\frac{1}{100}} \)
\( P(A|B) = 0.25 \)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.25.

So, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.25"}
