To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- The number of computer science professors, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The number of humanities professors, \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Since the description of Jason does not provide any additional information that differentiates between computer science and humanities professors, we assume that the description is just as likely to apply to a computer science professor as it is to a humanities professor. Therefore, the likelihood of the description matching either group is the same, meaning the probabilities related to the description are equal.

So we use the base rates directly:
- The likelihood of being a computer science professor is still \( P(C) = 0.25 \)
- The likelihood of being a humanities professor is still \( P(H) = 0.75 \)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem. The posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is:

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}
\]

Since the description is equally likely for both disciplines, \( P(\text{description} | C) = P(\text{description} | H) \), we have:

\[
P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given that \( P(\text{description} | C) = P(\text{description} | H) \) cancels out and the normalization simply depends on the priors:

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(C)}{P(C) + P(H)} = \frac{\frac{25}{100}}{\frac{25}{100} + \frac{75}{100}} = \frac{25}{100}
\]

Thus,

\[
P(C | \text{description}) = 0.25
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.25 \).
