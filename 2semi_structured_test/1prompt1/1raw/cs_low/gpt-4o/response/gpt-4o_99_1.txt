To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. In this case, we want to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \):**
   - The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor:
   \[
   P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   - The probability of Jason's description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) given he is a computer science professor. This seems typical for a computer science professor based on the description given.
   - Let's assume that such a description is very likely for computer science professors. For simplicity, suppose it is 0.8 (or 80%).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   - The probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor. Such a description seems less typical for humanities professors.
   - Let's assume that such a description is less likely for humanities professors. For simplicity, suppose it is 0.2 (or 20%).

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   - The total probability of Jason’s description can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

6. **Posterior Probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   - Finally, apply Bayes’ theorem:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571
   \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.571"}
