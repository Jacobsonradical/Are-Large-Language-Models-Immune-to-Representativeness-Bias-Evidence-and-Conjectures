To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here, we are given the total number of professors and their breakdown by field, along with a description of one professor.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\(C\)) = 25
- The number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 75
- Total number of professors (\(T\)) = 100

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is from computer science, which is \( \frac{C}{T} \).
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need to calculate \(P(A)\):
\[ P(A) = \frac{C}{T} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to consider \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|H)\), which are the probabilities of the given description (traits) for computer science and humanities professors, respectively. Since we lack specific data on the exact distributions of traits within each field, we'll make qualitative inferences based on the fact computer science professors are more likely to enjoy coding and solving mathematical puzzles than humanities professors.

Assuming:
- \(P(B|C) \approx 0.9\) (high likelihood because Jason's traits align closely with typical computer science interests)
- \(P(B|H) \approx 0.2\) (lower likelihood for these traits to align with humanities interests)

We now compute \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|C) \cdot P(C) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{P(B|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|B) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
