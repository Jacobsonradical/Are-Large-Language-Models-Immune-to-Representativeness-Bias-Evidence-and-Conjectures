To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in Computer Science (CS):
     \[
     P(CS) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
     \]

   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is in the Humanities (H):
     \[
     P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
     \]

2. **Likelihood:**
   - We need to evaluate the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor (\( P(\text{description} | CS) \)) and given that he is a Humanities professor (\( P(\text{description} | H) \)).

   Given the description traits (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, conservative, careful, talented, ambitious, highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing):
   - These traits are more stereotypically associated with CS professors rather than Humanities professors.

   For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.2 \)

3. **Posterior Probability:**
   - We want to find \( P(CS | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.

   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})}
   \]

   Where:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

   Then:
   \[
   P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
   \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
