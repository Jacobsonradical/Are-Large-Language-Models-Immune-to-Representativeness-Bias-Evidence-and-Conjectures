To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(C) \): The probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of encountering a description like Jason's given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of encountering a description like Jason's given that he is a humanities professor.

We know the following from the problem setup:

- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to make an assumption about \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) based on the description given. The description suggests characteristics that align more commonly with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than with a humanities professor.

Making an assumption that \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high (let's estimate 0.9) and \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low (let's estimate 0.1), we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \(D\):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(C|D) \):

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
