To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

First, let's define our hypotheses:
- \( H_{CS} \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H_{H} \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(H_{CS} | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem can be written as:
\[
P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS})}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H_{CS}) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We also know:
\[
P(D) = P(D | H_{CS}) \cdot P(H_{CS}) + P(D | H_{H}) \cdot P(H_{H})
\]

Given the data:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Hence, the priors are:
\[
P(H_{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H_{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Now, the likelihoods:
We need to assess the likelihood \( P(D | H_{CS}) \) and \( P(D | H_{H}) \).

- \( P(D | H_{CS}) \): Given his interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it seems highly likely that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H_{H}) \): Although it's possible for a humanities professor to have these traits, it's less likely.

Let's assume:
\[
P(D | H_{CS}) \approx 0.9 \text{ (high likelihood their interests match computer science)}
\]
\[
P(D | H_{H}) \approx 0.1 \text{ (low likelihood their interests match humanities)}
\]

Now compute \( P(D) \):
\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Finally, compute \( P(H_{CS} | D) \):
\[
P(H_{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{\{"probability": "0.75"\}}
\]
