To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes’ theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's define:
- Event A: Jason is a computer science professor.
- Event B: Jason’s description.

First, we find the prior probability \( P(A) \):

\[ P(A) = \text{Number of computer science professors} / \text{Total number of professors} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \), where \( \neg A \) denotes that Jason is not a computer science professor (i.e., he is a humanities professor).
Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common traits among computer science professors, we reason that:

- \( P(B|A) \) is high (let's assume a high probability, like 0.9).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is lower but nonzero since some humanities professors might have similar traits (let's assume a lower probability, like 0.2).

Finally, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Now we apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.6.
