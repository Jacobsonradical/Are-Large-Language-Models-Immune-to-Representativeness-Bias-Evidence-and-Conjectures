Given the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
   - \( D \): The description given (Jason's traits and interests).

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(C) \)) is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The probability that Jason is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - The description \( D \) fits more intuitively with the traits of a computer science professor given Jason's interest in coding and mathematical puzzles. Let's denote:
     - \( P(D|C) \): The probability Jason has the description given he is a computer science professor.
     - \( P(D|H) \): The probability Jason has the description given he is a humanities professor.

Given the description aligns more with a computer science professor, we can hypothesize:
   - \( P(D|C) \) might be high, let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(D|H) \) might be low, let's assume \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \).

4. **Posterior Probability:**
   - To find \( P(C|D) \) (the probability Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \)), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description, is:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now, find \( P(C|D) \):

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.75"}}}
\]
