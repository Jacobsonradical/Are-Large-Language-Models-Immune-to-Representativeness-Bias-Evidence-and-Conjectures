To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \) = The given description of Jason

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen successful professor is in computer science
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability of Jason's description if he is a computer science professor
- \( P(B|A^c) \) = Probability of Jason's description if he is a humanities professor

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, based on the description of Jason, he enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, all of which are more likely common among computer science professors than humanities professors. Without exact numerical probabilities, we assume the probabilities subjectively for illustration:

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (High likelihood given the interests align more with computer science)
- \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.2 \) (Lower likelihood for humanities professors)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571. 

Here is the probability in the specified format:
