To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. We start by defining:

- \(P(\text{CS})\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \(P(\text{Humanities})\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
- \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS})\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities})\): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \(P(\text{Description})\): The overall probability of Jason's description.

Given the sample sizes, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Let’s assume, based on Jason’s description, that his interests and personality traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.) align more with the traits commonly found in computer science professors rather than humanities professors. To simplify the calculation, we'll assume:

\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 1 \]
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \approx 0 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Because \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be broken down as:

\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 1 \times 0.25 + 0 \times 0.75 = 0.25 \]

So,

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description is:
