Sure, let's calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the provided description.

We have the following information:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor randomly is \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor randomly is \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Given Jason's description, it includes interests and traits that are more stereotypically associated with computer science (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities. To proceed with a Bayesian approach, we assume the description strongly suggests Jason is likely a computer science professor.

Let’s denote:
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description aligns more closely with stereotypical interests of a computer science professor, we make an assumption such as:
- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \) (a reasonable high likelihood given our biases/stereotypes)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (a reasonable low likelihood given our biases/stereotypes)

Applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
