To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our predictions based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the description provided for Jason.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor. i.e., \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Similarly, we need \( P(D | H) \) which is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor, and \( P(H) \) which is the prior probability of picking a humanities professor. i.e., \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To find \( P(D) \), we need:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Since the description suggests Jason has traits and interests more aligned with someone in computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), we can make an informed estimation:
- Let's assume \( P(D | C) = 0.9 \) (the chance that a computer science professor matches the description).
- Let's assume \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (the chance that a humanities professor matches the description).

Now plug these values into the formulas:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Then:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
