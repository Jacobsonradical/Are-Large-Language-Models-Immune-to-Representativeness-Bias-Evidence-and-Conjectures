This problem can be approached using Bayes' theorem. In this context, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (\( P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) \)) given his description.

Let:
- \( P(\text{CS}) \) be the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) \) be the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{Humanities}) \) be the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

The total number of professors is 100 (25 from computer science and 75 from humanities), so:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assuming Jason's interests and traits (especially the focus on coding and mathematical puzzles) make him more likely to be a computer science professor, let's assume:
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) = p_1 \)
- \( P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{Humanities}) = p_2 \)

Also let:
- The ratio \( p \) which is the likelihood of Jason's description being more fitting for a computer science professor compared to a humanities professor. Let's assume \( p = 10 \) as a reasonable estimate, indicating it is ten times more likely that a computer science professor fits Jason's description than a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Jason})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Jason}) = P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Now assuming \(P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{CS}) = p_1\) and \(P(\text{Jason} \mid \text{Humanities}) = \frac{p_1}{p}\):

\[ P(\text{Jason}) = p_1 \cdot 0.25 + \frac{p_1}{p} \cdot 0.75 \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{p_1 \cdot 0.25}{p_1 \cdot 0.25 + \frac{p_1}{p} \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + \frac{0.75}{p}} \]

Since we assumed \( p = 10 \):

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + \frac{0.75}{10}} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{0.25}{0.25 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) = \frac{0.25}{0.325} \]

\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Jason}) \approx 0.769 \]

Therefore, the probability is approximately 0.769.
