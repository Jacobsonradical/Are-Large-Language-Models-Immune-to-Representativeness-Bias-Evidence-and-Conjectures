To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence. Here, we need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description provided.

First, let's define the events:
- \( CS \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS | \text{description}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \): The total probability of the description.

Given the data:
- Total number of professors = 25 (computer science) + 75 (humanities) = 100
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To proceed, we need to estimate \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \). The description suggests Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are characteristics more aligned with a computer science professor. Therefore, we can assume:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \): Likelihood that a computer science professor fits this description is relatively high.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \): Likelihood that a humanities professor fits this description is relatively low.

For simplicity, we'll assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \approx 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \approx 0.2 \)

Now, calculating the total probability \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.5714 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
