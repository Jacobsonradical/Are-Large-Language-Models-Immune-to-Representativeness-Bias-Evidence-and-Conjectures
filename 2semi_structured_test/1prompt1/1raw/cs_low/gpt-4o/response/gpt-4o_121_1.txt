To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(A \mid D) \), where \( D \) is the description given of Jason. By Bayes' theorem,

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

To solve this, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(D \mid A) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description, which can be found using the law of total probability.

Given that the sample consists of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D \mid A) \) and \( P(D \mid B) \). Given the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and doesn't enjoy drawing or writing. These traits are more likely associated with a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, we can reasonably assume:

\[ P(D \mid A) > P(D \mid B) \]

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(D \mid A) = 0.8 \] (a high likelihood, reflecting the fit of the description with a computer science professor)
\[ P(D \mid B) = 0.2 \] (a lower likelihood, reflecting the lesser fit of the description with a humanities professor)

Using the law of total probability \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(D \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \(0.571\).
