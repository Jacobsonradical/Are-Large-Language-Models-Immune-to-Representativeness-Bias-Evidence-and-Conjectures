To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Given the problem details:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The prior probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We need to determine \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \). Based on the description, Jason enjoys activities like coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common among computer science professors.

Assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) is high because the description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is low because the description less likely fits a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assume the values:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \)

Using the law of total probability, \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
