To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the description given.

Here's the application of Bayes' theorem to our problem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor is the proportion of computer science professors in the sample.
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(\neg A) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
\[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**: The probability that a given description (like Jason's) is drawn for a computer science professor. This probability involves an assumption: that Jason's profile (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) is more likely for a computer science professor. Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \)**: The probability that a given description (like Jason's) is drawn for a humanities professor. This is likely smaller since the description fits a computer science professor more closely. Let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

5. **Normalization \( P(B) \)**: The total probability of drawing such a description.
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now we can compute the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \{\text{"probability": "0.571"}\} \]
