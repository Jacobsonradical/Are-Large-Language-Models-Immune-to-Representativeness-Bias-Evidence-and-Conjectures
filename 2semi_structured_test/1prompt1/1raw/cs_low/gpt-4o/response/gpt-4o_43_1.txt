To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we need to:

1. Calculate the prior probability of each group (computer science professors and humanities professors).
2. Incorporate the evidence (Jason's description) to calculate the posterior probability.

Given:
- Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
- Number of humanities professors (H): 75
- Total professors: 100

### Step 1: Calculate Prior Probabilities
The prior probability \( P(CS) \) of Jason being a computer science professor is:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The prior probability \( P(H) \) of Jason being a humanities professor is:
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Likelihoods
Next, we estimate the likelihood of the evidence (Jason's description) given each group. While precise probabilities for how likely a computer science professor or a humanities professor fits Jason's description are not provided, we can reasonably conclude that Jason's interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) align more closely with typical computer science activities.

Let \( P(D|CS) \) be the likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor, and \( P(D|H) \) be the likelihood given he is a humanities professor. Without exact numbers, let us assume:

- \( P(D|CS) \approx 0.9 \): High likelihood given his description matching a typical computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \): Lower likelihood given his description not matching a typical humanities professor, as they might not enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles as much.

### Step 3: Calculate Posterior Probability
Using Bayes' Theorem, we find the posterior probability \( P(CS|D) \):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
