To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's identify these probabilities step by step:

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(A) \)):
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Complementary Probability** (\( P(\neg A) \)):
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - Thus, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(B|A) \): This is the probability of having Jason’s description if he's a computer science professor. Given his enjoyment of coding and solving puzzles, this probability is likely high. We can assume, for simplicity, that \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \): This is the probability of having Jason’s description if he's a humanities professor. Given his lack of enjoyment for drawing or writing and his enjoyment of coding, this is likely to be lower. We can assume, for simplicity, that \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \).

4. **Total Probability** (\( P(B) \)):
   - \( P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \)
   - \( P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.3 \)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is 0.75.
