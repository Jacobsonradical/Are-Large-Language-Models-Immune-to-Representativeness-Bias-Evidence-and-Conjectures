To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, we need to determine the necessary probabilities:

- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the given description for both groups. Let's denote the description as \( D \).

- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given the professor is from the humanities.

While we don't have exact numerical likelihoods \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we can make an informed qualitative estimate based on the description provided. Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles strongly suggests he is more likely to be in computer science. Let's assume:

- \( P(D | CS) \) is high, say 0.9
- \( P(D | H) \) is low, say 0.1

With these estimates, we use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) * P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) * P(CS) + P(D | H) * P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 * 0.25) + (0.1 * 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
