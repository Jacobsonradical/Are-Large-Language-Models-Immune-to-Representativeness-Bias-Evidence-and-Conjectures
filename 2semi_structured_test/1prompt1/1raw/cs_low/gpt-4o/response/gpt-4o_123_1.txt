To calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's determine the values for these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. With 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Complementary Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)**:
   The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. With 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors:
   \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor. Based on the description's alignment with typical interests and traits of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles, not enjoying drawing/writing):
   We assign a subjective likelihood \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (based on strong alignment with computer science interests).

4. **Complementary Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \)**:
   The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description's misalignment with typical humanities interests:
   We assign a subjective likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.1 \).

5. **Overall Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The total probability of getting the description regardless of profession:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to calculate:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
