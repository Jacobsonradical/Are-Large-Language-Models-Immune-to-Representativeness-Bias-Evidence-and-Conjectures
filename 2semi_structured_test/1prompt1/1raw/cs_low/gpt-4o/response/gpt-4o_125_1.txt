First, we will consider the base rates (or prior probabilities) of the two groups of professors. We have:
- 25 tenured computer science professors
- 75 tenured humanities professors

This means the prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and for humanities, it is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to use the description of Jason to update these probabilities. Some of the traits described for Jason may be more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor.

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging. These activities are highly suggestive of a computer science professor. On the other hand, the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing might be seen as less common for a humanities professor.

Using Bayesian reasoning:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Let's denote:
- \(\text{CS}\) = Computer Science
- \(\text{H}\) = Humanities
- \( \text{description}\) = Jason's description

We need an estimate of \(\frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS)}{P(\text{description} \mid H)}\). Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, we might assign significantly higher likelihood to computer science professors.

For example, let's assume:
- \(P(\text{description} \mid CS) \approx 0.8\) (indicating these traits are quite likely for a computer science professor)
- \(P(\text{description} \mid H) \approx 0.2\) (indicating these traits are less likely for a humanities professor)

So,

\[ \text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(\text{description} \mid CS)}{P(\text{description} \mid H)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem and plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(CS \mid \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{(0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
