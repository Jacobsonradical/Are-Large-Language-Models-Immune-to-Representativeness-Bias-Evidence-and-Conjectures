To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C \mid E) \): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the evidence \( E \) (the description provided).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E \mid C) \) is the probability of the evidence given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(C) \): The probability of Jason being a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - \( P(H) \): The probability of Jason being a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - Based on the description, Jason's interests and personality traits more closely align with typical characteristics of computer science professors (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles).
   - Let's assume that the description's alignment with computer science professors is more probable than with humanities professors. If we assume a simplified model:
     - \( P(E \mid C) = 0.8 \) (There is a high likelihood that the description fits a computer science professor)
     - \( P(E \mid H) = 0.2 \) (There is a lower likelihood that the description fits a humanities professor)

3. **Total Probability**:
   - We need to calculate \( P(E) \) as follows:
     \[ P(E) = P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.35 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C \mid E) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.

The final answer is:
