To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let:
- \(C\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor.
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of Jason’s description.

Assumptions:
- Let's assume descriptions like Jason’s are more common among computer science professors compared to humanities professors based on his interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.).

Let's denote:
- \(P(D|C) = p\)
- \(P(D|H) = q\)

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Using the total probability theorem:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) = p \cdot 0.25 + q \cdot 0.75 \]

Now we substitute the values back into the Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{p \cdot 0.25}{p \cdot 0.25 + q \cdot 0.75} \]

Given that descriptions like Jason’s are more common among computer science professors, we can assume \(p > q\). Let's further assume for calculation simplicity:
- \(p = 0.8\) (high probability for a computer science professor)
- \(q = 0.2\) (low probability for a humanities professor)

Then:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
{"probability": "0.571"}
