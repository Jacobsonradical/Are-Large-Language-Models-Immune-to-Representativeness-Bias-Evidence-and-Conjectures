We can use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description. Let's define the events:

- \(CS\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(HU\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Jason's description.

We seek \(P(CS|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D|CS)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(CS)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, we establish the prior probabilities:

- \(P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\) (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors).
- \(P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\) (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|HU)\). Based on Jason's description, it seems more aligned with typical interests and traits of a computer science professor than a humanities professor (e.g., coding, mathematical puzzles). Let's assume:

- \(P(D|CS) = 0.8\)
- \(P(D|HU) = 0.2\)

Now we calculate \(P(D)\) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|HU) \cdot P(HU) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can compute \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
