To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the key components:

- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \) = Probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \) = Overall probability of the description occurring regardless of the field.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We have the following prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Given the description, it's more likely that Jason is a computer science professor due to his interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, we don't have exact probabilities, so let's operate under realistic assumptions:

- Suppose \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (High probability given the description matches characteristics common in computer science)
- Suppose \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (Lower probability given the description doesn't match as closely with typical characteristics in the humanities)

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
