To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the necessary components:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities: \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood that Jason's description fits a computer science professor, \( P(description | CS) \).
   - The likelihood that Jason's description fits a humanities professor, \( P(description | Hum) \).

Since we are not provided with detailed likelihood values for \( P(description | CS) \) and \( P(description | Hum) \), we can infer them based on the description. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators suggesting a background in computer science. 

Based on this:
- Assume \( P(description | CS) \approx 0.80 \) (high likelihood for a CS professor)
- Assume \( P(description | Hum) \approx 0.20 \) (low likelihood for a humanities professor)

3. **Normalization**:
   - We use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(CS | description) \):

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(description)} \]

Where \( P(description) \) is the total probability of the description, computed as:
\[ P(description) = P(description | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

\[ P(description) = (0.80 \cdot 0.25) + (0.20 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(description) = 0.20 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(description) = 0.35 \]

Now, compute \( P(CS | description) \):

\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{0.20}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{20}{35} \]
\[ P(CS | description) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | description) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

The answer in the required format is:
{"probability": "0.571"}
