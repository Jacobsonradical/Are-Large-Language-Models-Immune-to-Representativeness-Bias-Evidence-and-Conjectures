To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here's the theorem in a nutshell:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description occurring.

Let's break these components down:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor) is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor) is what we need to estimate based on the description and the known characteristics of computer science professors.
- \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the description) includes contributions from both computer science and humanities professors.

Assuming the description fits a computer science professor more closely than a humanities professor due to the interests mentioned (coding, mathematical puzzles), we might estimate:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (high probability that a computer science professor matches the description)
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) \approx 0.2 \) (lower probability that a humanities professor matches the description)

The total probability of the description \( P(B) \) combines both groups:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.
