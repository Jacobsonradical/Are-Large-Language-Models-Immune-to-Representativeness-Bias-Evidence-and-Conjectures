To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the variables:

- \( P(CS | D) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) = Overall probability of the description.

We are given:
- 25 out of 100 professors are computer science professors.
- 75 out of 100 professors are humanities professors.

Thus:
- \( P(CS) \) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

The description of Jason ("enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging") seems more aligned with typical interests of computer science professors than humanities professors. Assuming that:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is high (let's approximate this as 0.8 based on described traits).
- \( P(D | H) \) is low (let's approximate this as 0.2 based on described traits).

We can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

So:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.2) + (0.15) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, plug \( P(D) \) back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
