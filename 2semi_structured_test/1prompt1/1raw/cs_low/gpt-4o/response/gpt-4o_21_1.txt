To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his description, we need to consider both the prior probability and the likelihood of the description matching a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. This situation can be modeled using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description (regardless of whether Jason is a computer science or humanities professor).

1. **Prior Probability (\( P(A) \)):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Complement Prior Probability (\( P(\neg A) \)):**
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihood (\( P(B|A) \)):**
   - Jason’s description seems to fit a computer science professor because he enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and is described as conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious. Based on the descriptive elements, let us assume that there is a high probability, say 0.9, that a description like this fits a computer science professor.
   - \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \)

4. **Likelihood (\( P(B|\neg A) \)):**
   - Jason’s description does not align well with typical characteristics we might attribute to a humanities professor. Hence, the probability might be lower, say 0.2.
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.2 \)

5. **Overall Probability (\( P(B) \)):**
   - This is a weighted average, considering both groups:
     \[
     P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
     \]
     \[
     P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
     \]
     \[
     P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
     \]

6. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
