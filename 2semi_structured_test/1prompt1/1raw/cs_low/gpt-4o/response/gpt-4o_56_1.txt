To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given his profile, we can use Bayesian probability.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description provided fits Jason.

First, we'll use the base rates of the professors in the sample:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
- \( P(B) \): Probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.

\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the description \( D \) given each group. For simplicity, we assume that traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are more common among computer science professors than among humanities professors. Let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid A) \): Probability of the description matching a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid B) \): Probability of the description matching a humanities professor.

Without precise data, we might reasonably estimate these likelihoods based on the predicates described. Let's hypothesize:
- \( P(D \mid A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D \mid B) = 0.1 \)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(A \mid D) \):

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(D \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substitute the values in:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, substitute back to find \( P(A \mid D) \):

\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
