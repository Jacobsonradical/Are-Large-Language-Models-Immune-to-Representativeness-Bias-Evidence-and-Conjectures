To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define our problem in terms of conditional probabilities.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to find \( P(C | \text{description}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})} \]

We know:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

We need to find \( P(\text{description} | C) \) and \( P(\text{description} | H) \) and then \( P(\text{description}) \).

Given the description of Jason, it seems more characteristic of a computer science professor due to references such as coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are typically more common in this field than in the humanities.

Let's assume:
- \( P(\text{description} | C) \) is high, say 0.9.
- \( P(\text{description} | H) \) is low, say 0.1.

Now, we can calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.3 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
