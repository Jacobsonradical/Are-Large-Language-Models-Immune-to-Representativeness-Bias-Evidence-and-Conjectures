To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes’ theorem. We need to use the rates of computer science professors and humanities professors in the sample, and the likelihood of the description matching each group.

Here, we assume that descriptions like enjoying coding are more common among computer science professors.

Given:
- \( n_{CS} = 25 \), the number of computer science professors.
- \( n_{Hum} = 75 \), the number of humanities professors.
- There are 100 professors in total.

We need:
1. The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \).
2. The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \).
3. The likelihood of the description matching a computer science professor, \( P(D|CS) \).
4. The likelihood of the description matching a humanities professor, \( P(D|Hum) \).

Using Bayes’ theorem:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:

\[ 
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum) 
\]

Assumptions:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Given Jason’s description aligns more with a computer science professor, let's assume:
- \( P(D|CS) \) (likelihood he is a CS professor given the description) = 1 (highly likely that someone enjoying coding, etc., is a CS professor)
- \( P(D|Hum) \) (likelihood he is a humanities professor given the description) = 0.1 (less likely due to his interest in coding, etc.)

Thus:

\[ 
P(D) = (1 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.25 + 0.075 = 0.325 
\]

And:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{1 \times 0.25}{0.325} ≈ 0.769 
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ 
\{\ "probability"\ : \ "0.769"\ \}
\]
