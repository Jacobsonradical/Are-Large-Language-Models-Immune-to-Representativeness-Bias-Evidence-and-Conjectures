First, let's establish the given:

- Total professors: 100 (25 in computer science, 75 in humanities)
- Description of Jason has certain traits more aligned with computer science (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) and less aligned with humanities (does not enjoy drawing or writing).

To estimate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is in computer science.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of obtaining Jason's description.

### Calculations:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \):**

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

2. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**

Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it's more likely that these traits correlate with computer science professors. Assuming that computer science professors tend to have these traits more than humanities professors:

\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(B) \):**
   
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Here, \( \neg A \) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor. 

\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \]

Assuming this profile is less likely among humanities professors:

\[ P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \]

Then:

\[
P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.75 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
