To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here is the theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) = Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) = Description fits Jason.

First, let's identify the necessary probabilities:
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors total, \(P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \(P(\neg A)\) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor. \(P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need the probabilities \(P(B|A)\) and \(P(B|\neg A)\):
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) is the probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, a trait more common among computer science professors, we can assume \(P(B|A)\) > \(P(B|\neg A)\). However, to be precise we need to know these values, but in the absence of specific data, an assumption based on typical traits may be made.

Assume:
- \(P(B|A) = 0.8\) (Jason enjoys activities common among computer scientists).
- \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.1\) (The activities are less common among humanities professors).

Now, compute \(P(B)\):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.

Thus, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.727"}
