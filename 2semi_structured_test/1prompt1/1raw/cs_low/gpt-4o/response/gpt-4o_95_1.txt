To compute the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability given new evidence.

First, let's define the terms:

- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

We know:
- \( P(C) = 25/100 = 0.25 \) (since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100)
- \( P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75 \) (since there are 75 humanities professors out of 100)

Assume \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) based on the description given, considering factors like interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creativity without interest in drawing or writing, and overall conservativeness. 

Given the description, Jason seems to have characteristics more typical of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) than a humanities professor. We will estimate:

- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \) (high probability that a CS professor fits this description)
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (low probability that a humanities professor fits this description)

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
\[ \text{"probability": "0.6"} \]
