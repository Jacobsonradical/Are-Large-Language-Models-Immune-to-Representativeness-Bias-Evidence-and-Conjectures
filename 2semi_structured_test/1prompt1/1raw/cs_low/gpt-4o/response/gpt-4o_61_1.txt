Let's use Bayesian reasoning to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample. We need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \):**
   Since there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, the prior probability is:
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability \( P(\neg A) \) (not a computer science professor):**
   75 out of the 100 professors are from the humanities:
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \):**
   This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it's reasonable to assume this fits a computer science professor profile quite well. Let's assume that this likelihood is high, say:
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   This is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given his interests, it seems less likely but still possible, say:
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \]

5. **Total probability \( P(B) \):**
   By the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
