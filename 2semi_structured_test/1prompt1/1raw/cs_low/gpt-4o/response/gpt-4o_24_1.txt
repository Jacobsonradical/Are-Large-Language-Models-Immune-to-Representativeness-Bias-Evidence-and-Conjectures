To determine the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the setup:

- We are given 25 professors in computer science and 75 professors in the humanities.
- Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
  - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
  - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of the description fitting a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Since Jason's interests and characteristics (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging) seem more aligned with a computer science background, let's make a reasonable estimate:
- Suppose the probability of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor is very high, say \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- Suppose the probability of Jason's description fitting a humanities professor is relatively low, say \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \) 

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description can be computed as follows:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Then:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = 0.6 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
