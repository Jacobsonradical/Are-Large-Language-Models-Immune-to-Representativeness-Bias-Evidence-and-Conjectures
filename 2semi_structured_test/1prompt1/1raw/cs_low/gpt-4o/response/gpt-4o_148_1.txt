To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description among all professors.

First, we need to define these probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)**:
   The probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of CS Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A') \)**:
   The probability that a randomly selected professor is from the humanities:
   \[
   P(A') = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities Professors}}{\text{Total Number of Professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)**:
   The probability of Jason’s description given he is a computer science professor. Since the description mentions interests closely related to computer science (coding, mathematical puzzles), we will assume this probability is relatively high. For the sake of calculation, let's hypothesize:
   \[
   P(B|A) = 0.8
   \]
   (This is an arbitrary likelihood, as exact frequency data is not provided)

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A') \)**:
   The probability of Jason’s description given he is a humanities professor. The description fits less with typical humanities interests (e.g., no mention of drawing or writing, interest in coding and mathematical puzzles). Let’s assume:
   \[
   P(B|A') = 0.1
   \]

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
   The total probability of Jason's description across all professors:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
   \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.727.

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.727"}
\]
