To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS | D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

First, let's find \( P(CS) \) and \( P(H) \) (the probability of someone being a humanities professor):

\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), which concern how well Jason's description fits a computer science professor or a humanities professor.

Jason's interests and personality traits (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, being conservative, and not enjoying drawing or writing) suggest that he is more likely to be a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. This is a subjective probability, but let's make reasonable estimates:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.2 \]

Now, we can find \( P(D) \) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.571 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.

Thus, the answer is:

\[ {"probability": "0.571"} \]
