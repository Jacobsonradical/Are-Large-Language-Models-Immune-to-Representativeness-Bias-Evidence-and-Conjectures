To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. This requires calculating the probability of Jason having the described traits given that he is a computer science professor and the probability of having these traits given that he is a humanities professor.

Here is the formal approach using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description occurring.

1. **Calculate the prior probabilities:**
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]
   where \( P(H) \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.

2. **Estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):**
   Based on the description provided, Jason seems to fit the profile of a computer science professor due to his interests in coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
   \[
   P(D|CS) = 0.8 \quad (\text{This is a reasonable estimate based on the given description})
   \]
   However, let's assume the probability of a humanities professor fitting this description is lower:
   \[
   P(D|H) = 0.2 \quad (\text{This is a reasonable estimate})
   \]

3. **Compute \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:**
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
   \]

4. **Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(CS|D) \):**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}
   \]
   \[
   P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately \( 0.5714 \).

\[
\text{"probability": "0.5714"}
\]
