To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\)) can be suggested to be higher due to the interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
   - The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\)) could be suggested to be lower for the same reasons.

Since exact probabilities for \(P(D|CS)\) and \(P(D|H)\) are not given, we will estimate these based on typical stereotypes:
   - Let's assume \(P(D|CS) = 0.9\), as Jason's interests strongly align with common traits of computer scientists.
   - Let's assume \(P(D|H) = 0.1\), as Jason's interests do not align well with typical traits expected in the humanities.

3. **Total Probability of the Description (Normalizing Constant):**
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \] 
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

4. **Posterior Probability:**
Using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(CS|D)\):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[ \boxed{"probability": "0.75"} \]
