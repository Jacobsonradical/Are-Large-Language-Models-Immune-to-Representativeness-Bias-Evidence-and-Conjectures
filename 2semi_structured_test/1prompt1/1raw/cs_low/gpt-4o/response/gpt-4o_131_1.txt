To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let’s denote the following:

- \(C\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) is the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) is the description of Jason.

We need to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \(D\).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Let's break this down:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \(P(C)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \(P(H)\): The probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.
  
   Given that there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - \(P(D|C)\): The probability of the description \(D\) given that the professor is from computer science.
   - \(P(D|H)\): The probability of the description \(D\) given that the professor is from humanities.

Since detailed likelihoods \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \) are not provided, we observe that Jason has characteristics often associated with computer science professors (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) more than with humanities professors. Let's assume that the likelihood \( P(D|C) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \).

For simplicity, if we assume \( P(D|C) \) is much higher than \( P(D|H) \), we can use heuristic reasoning. This would suggest that Jason’s traits significantly lean towards computer science, often interpreted through a simplified analogy where we say:
\[ P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \]

3. **Total Probability**:
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

4. **Posterior Probability**:
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(C|D) = \frac{2}{3} \]
   \[ P(C|D) \approx 0.67 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is approximately 0.67.

Therefore, the answer is:
