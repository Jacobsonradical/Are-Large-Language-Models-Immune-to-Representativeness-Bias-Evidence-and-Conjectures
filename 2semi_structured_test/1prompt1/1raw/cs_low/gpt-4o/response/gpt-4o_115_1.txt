To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) be the event of having Jason's description.

We first need to calculate \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):
- The probability of selecting a computer science professor \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- The probability of selecting a humanities professor \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's consider the probabilities of the description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(B|A) \) and given that he is a humanities professor \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Given his description (enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, but not drawing or writing), it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor. For simplicity, let's assume:

- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood the description matches a computer science professor),
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood the description matches a humanities professor).

Now we calculate the total probability \( P(B) \) as follows:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|\neg A) * P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9) * (0.25) + (0.2) * (0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.225) + (0.15) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.375 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 * 0.25}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
