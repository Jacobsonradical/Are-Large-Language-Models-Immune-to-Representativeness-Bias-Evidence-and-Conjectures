To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(CS) \) as the probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) as the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of the given description if Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Given the prior probabilities based on the sample sizes:

\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

We need to assume the likelihoods \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). The description suggests Jason has traits more associated with a computer science professor (enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles), so we might assume \( P(D|CS) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \). However, since these exact probabilities are not given, let us assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) for the sake of calculation.

Now calculate \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{0.75}
\]

So, the answer in the required format is:
```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
