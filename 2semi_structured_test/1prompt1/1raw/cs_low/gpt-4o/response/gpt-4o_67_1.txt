To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to determine \( P(CS \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).
- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \).

Using the law of total probability for \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Based on the description, Jason seems more likely to have traits associated with a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. Let us assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = \alpha \), where \( \alpha \) is a high probability.
- \( P(D \mid H) = \beta \), where \( \beta \) is a low probability.

Although we do not have exact values for \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), we can work with the qualitative assessment. Letâ€™s assume \(\alpha\) is much larger than \(\beta\). For example, let's guess:
\[ \alpha = 0.9 \]
\[ \beta = 0.1 \]

Now, we substitute the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we compute \( P(CS \mid D) \):
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
