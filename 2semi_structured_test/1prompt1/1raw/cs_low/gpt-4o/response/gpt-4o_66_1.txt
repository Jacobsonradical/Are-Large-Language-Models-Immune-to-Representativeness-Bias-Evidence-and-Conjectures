To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(B\) is the event that Jason has the given description.

First, we need to determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that any selected professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A^C) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.

From the information given:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors: \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors: \( P(A^C) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \), we use the information about Jason's interests:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely to be attributes of a computer science professor.
- These interests make it more probable that Jason belongs to the group of computer science professors.

Without precise numerical probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^C) \), we can make a reasoned guess based on the description's alignment with typical attributes of computer science vs. humanities professors.

Generally accepted reasoning might assume that:
- \( P(B|A) \) is higher than \( P(B|A^C) \).

To simplify the problem, if we assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) and \( P(B|A^C) = 0.1 \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
