To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we approach it:

1. **Total Sample Size**: There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, making a total of 100 professors.
2. **Prior Probability**:
    - Probability (Computer Science Professor) = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
    - Probability (Humanities Professor) = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)
3. **Likelihood**:
    - The description of Jason suggests characteristics that align more with a computer science professor. We would assign higher likelihood to computer science professors.
  
   Let's assume the likelihoods based on the description:
   - Likelihood (Description | Computer Science Professor) = L_CS
   - Likelihood (Description | Humanities Professor) = L_H

   Given the provided description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles) fits better with a computer science professor, let's use L_CS = 0.8 and L_H = 0.2 (assuming).

4. **Bayesian Update**:

   Using Bayes' Theorem:
    \[
    P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science})}{P(\text{Description})}
    \]
    Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) = Total probability of the description occurring:
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | \text{Computer Science}) \cdot P(\text{Computer Science}) 
    + P(\text{Description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
    \]
    Therefore,
    \[
    P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
    \]
    \[
    P(\text{Computer Science} | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{20}{35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571
    \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
