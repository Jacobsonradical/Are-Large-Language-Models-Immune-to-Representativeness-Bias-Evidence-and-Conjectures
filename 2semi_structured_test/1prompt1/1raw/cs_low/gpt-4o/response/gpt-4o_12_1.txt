To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the description provided.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(A') \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

We also need:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that Jason matches the description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A') \), the probability that Jason matches the description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it is more likely these traits are found in a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Given the description and the typical profiles:
- Let’s assume \( P(B|A) \) is quite high, e.g., \(0.8\).
- Let’s assume \( P(B|A') \) is low, e.g., \(0.2\).

Finally, we calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) =  0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \approx 0.571 \]

In the required format, the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.571"}
