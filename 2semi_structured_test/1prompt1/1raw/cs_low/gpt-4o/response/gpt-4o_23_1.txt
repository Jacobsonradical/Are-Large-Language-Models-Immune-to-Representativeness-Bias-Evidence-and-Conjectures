To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll employ Bayes' Theorem, which facilitates the update of probabilities based on new evidence. The theorem can be mathematically stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A^c \): Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the study's sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- The prior probabilities are:
  \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
  \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider how likely the description of Jason would be for computer science and humanities professors. 
Based on Jason's description:
- Enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles points more towards being a computer science professor.
- The relative probability of Jason being a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)) seems higher compared to the probability that a humanities professor would have such a description (\( P(B|A^c) \)).

Suppose (approximatively):
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) (Higher likelihood given the nature of the activities described)
- \( P(B|A^c) \approx 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \text{"probability": "0.571"} \]

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
