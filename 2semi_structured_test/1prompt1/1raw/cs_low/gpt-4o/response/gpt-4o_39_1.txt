To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the Prior Probability**
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor (\( P(CS) \)) is:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor (\( P(H) \)) is:
  \[
  P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

**Step 2: Assess the Likelihood**
- Based on Jason's description, we need to estimate the probability of getting a description like Jason's assuming he is a computer science professor (\( P(Jason|CS) \)) and the probability of getting a description like Jason's assuming he is a humanities professor (\( P(Jason|H) \)).

Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it's more likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assign these probabilities subjectively:
  \[
  P(Jason|CS) = 0.9  \quad \text{(high likelihood since his interests align closely with computer science)}
  \]
  \[
  P(Jason|H) = 0.2  \quad \text{(low likelihood since his interests do not closely align with humanities)}
  \]

**Step 3: Use Bayes' Theorem to Find the Posterior Probability**
- Using Bayes' theorem:
  \[
  P(CS|Jason) = \frac{P(Jason|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Jason)}
  \]

To find \( P(Jason) \), we use the law of total probability:
  \[
  P(Jason) = P(Jason|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Jason|H) \times P(H)
  \]

Plugging in the numbers:
  \[
  P(Jason) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)
  \]
  \[
  P(Jason) = 0.225 + 0.15
  \]
  \[
  P(Jason) = 0.375
  \]

Now, we calculate \( P(CS|Jason) \):
  \[
  P(CS|Jason) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375}
  \]
  \[
  P(CS|Jason) = \frac{0.225}{0.375}
  \]
  \[
  P(CS|Jason) = 0.6
  \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.6"}
\]
