To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

We are given:
- 25 tenured professors in computer science (CS)
- 75 tenured professors in the humanities

Let's denote:
- \( P(CS) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D|CS) \) as the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a computer science professor
- \( P(D|H) \) as the probability of observing the description given that Jason is a humanities professor
- \( P(D) \) as the overall probability of observing the description

We need to find:
- \( P(CS|D) \), the posterior probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description

First, we note the prior probabilities:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Assume that based on the description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creative but doesn't enjoy drawing or writing), it is more likely that Jason is a CS professor than a humanities professor. For estimation purposes, let's say:
- \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) (High because the interests align well with a CS professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (Low because it is less likely a humanities professor would match the description)

Now we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of observing the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now we compute \( P(CS|D) \):
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately \( 0.5714 \).

The final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.5714"}
