To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The given description of Jason.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we estimate the likelihoods \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \). According to the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of a computer science professor.
- The description does not strongly align with humanities based on typical interests.

Thus, let's assume:
\[ P(D | C) = 0.9 \] (a higher probability given how closely it matches the computer science traits)
\[ P(D | H) = 0.1 \] (a lower probability given the mismatch with typical humanities traits)

Using the Law of Total Probability, we can find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | D) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.

Thus, the answer will be as follows:

{"probability": "0.75"}
