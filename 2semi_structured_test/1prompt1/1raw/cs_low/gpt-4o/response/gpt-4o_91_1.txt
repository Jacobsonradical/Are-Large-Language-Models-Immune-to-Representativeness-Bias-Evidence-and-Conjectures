To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:

- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor
- \( D \): The given description of Jason

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to determine each component of this equation:

- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description overall.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Thus,

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, for simplicity, we will assume that the description is more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. However, we need some estimations:

Let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) (The probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (The probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor)

However, the key value depends on Jason's characteristics. Since he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it's reasonable to assign a higher probability to him being in computer science.

To compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": "0.571" \} \]
