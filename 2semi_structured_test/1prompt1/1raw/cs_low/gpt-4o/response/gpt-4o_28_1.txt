To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The goal is to find \( P(CS | D) \) which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor (CS) given the description (D).

First, let's define the necessary probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of the description.

The sample has 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

From Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We can break this down further with the total probability rule:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

For simplicity, we assume that the description fits a computer science professor better than a humanities professor (i.e., Jason’s enjoyment of coding, mathematical puzzles, etc. suggests he might be in computer science). Let’s hypothesize \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \) based on this fit. It’s reasonable to assume:

\[ P(D | CS) \approx 0.8 \]
\[ P(D | H) \approx 0.2 \]

Thus:
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

The answer in the requested format is:
\[ \{"probability": "0.571"\} \]
