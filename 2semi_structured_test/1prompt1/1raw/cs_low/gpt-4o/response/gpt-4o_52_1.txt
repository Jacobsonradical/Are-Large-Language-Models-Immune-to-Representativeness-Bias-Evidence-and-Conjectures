To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is useful when we need to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

Let's define the following events:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.

We know that:
- There are 25 computer science professors (CS) and 75 humanities professors (H), so the prior probabilities are:
  - \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
  - \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

We need to determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. We need to find \(P(C | \text{description})\).

We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(\text{description})}\]

Where:
- \(P(\text{description} | C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{description})\) is the overall probability of the description, which can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | C) \cdot P(C) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H)\]

Given the conditions in the description, we assume \(P(\text{description} | C)\) is higher than \(P(\text{description} | H)\) due to the alignment with traits common in computer science, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. However, without specific values for \(P(\text{description} | C)\) and \(P(\text{description} | H)\), we have to rely on a heuristic judgment.

Assume \(P(\text{description} | C)\) = 0.8 and \(P(\text{description} | H)\) = 0.2 based on the subjective fit to the computer science profile.

Now, let's compute \(P(\text{description})\):

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, we calculate \(P(C | \text{description})\):

\[ P(C | \text{description}) = \frac{ 0.8 \cdot 0.25 }{ 0.35 } = \frac{ 0.2 }{ 0.35 } \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
