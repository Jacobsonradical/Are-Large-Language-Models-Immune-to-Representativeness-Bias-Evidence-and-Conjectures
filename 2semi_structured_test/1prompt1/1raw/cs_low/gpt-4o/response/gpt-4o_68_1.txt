To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to balance the prior probabilities with the given description.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability of each group:**
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total professors: \(25 + 75 = 100\).

   So, the prior probability \(P(CS)\) that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
   The prior probability \(P(Hum)\) that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities is \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

2. **Likelihood based on the description:**
   - Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, all of which are more stereotypically aligned with activities of a computer science professor.
   - He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are generally more related to the fields in humanities.

3. **We need to assume that the description matches more closely with a typical computer science professor than a humanities professor.**

Let's denote:
- \(P(\text{Description} | CS)\) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(\text{Description} | Hum)\) as the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(\text{Description})\) as the total probability of the description.

We assume the description given is more likely for a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Without specific numbers, let's assume:
- \(P(\text{Description} | CS) = 0.8\)
- \(P(\text{Description} | Hum) = 0.2\)

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{Description})}\]

where,

\[P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{Description} | Hum) \cdot P(Hum)\]

\[P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)\]
\[P(\text{Description}) = 0.2 + 0.15\]
\[P(\text{Description}) = 0.35\]

Thus,

\[P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}\]
\[P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35}\]
\[P(CS | \text{Description}) = \frac{2}{3}\]
\[P(CS | \text{Description}) \approx 0.67\]

The probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.67.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.67"}
