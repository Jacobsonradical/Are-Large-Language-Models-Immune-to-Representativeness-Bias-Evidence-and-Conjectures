Let's solve this problem by applying Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the probability based on new evidence.

First, we need to define the given probabilities:

1. **Prior probability of being a Computer Science professor (P(CS))**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)

2. **Prior probability of being a Humanities professor (P(H))**:
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to consider the likelihood **P(description | CS)** and **P(description | H)**. In the absence of specific numerical data, these likelihoods will largely be based on reasonable assumptions derived from the description and general knowledge about the two fields.

- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are strong indicators of a computer science professor.
- Jason's description does not heavily favor the humanities field since he does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are often associated with humanities professors.

Hence, we can reasonably assume:

- **P(description | CS)** is quite high.
- **P(description | H)** is relatively low.

Now, we will use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \times P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \times P(H) \]

Assuming for the purpose of this calculation:

- \( P(\text{description} | CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood)
- \( P(\text{description} | H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood)

Let's calculate \( P(\text{description}) \):

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) \approx 0.5714 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.

Therefore, in the required format:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
