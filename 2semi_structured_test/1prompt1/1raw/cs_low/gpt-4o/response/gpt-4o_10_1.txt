To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. The steps are as follows:

1. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - Probability of being a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of being a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. Calculate the likelihoods:
   - Likelihood of the description given a computer science professor (\(P(D|CS)\))
   - Likelihood of the description given a humanities professor (\(P(D|H)\))

To estimate these likelihoods, we infer based on the description:
- Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, which are more strongly associated with computer science.
- He does not enjoy drawing or writing, which are more commonly associated with humanities.

Therefore, we can reasonably assume:
- \(P(D|CS)\) is relatively high.
- \(P(D|H)\) is relatively low.

For the sake of this computation, let's assign:
- \(P(D|CS) = 0.7\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.1\)

3. Use Bayes' theorem to find the probability, \(P(CS|D)\):
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description, computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.7 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.175 + 0.075 = 0.25
   \]

4. Substitute the values back into Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = \frac{0.175}{0.25} = 0.7
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
