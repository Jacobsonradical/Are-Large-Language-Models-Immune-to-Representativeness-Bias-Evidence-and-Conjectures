To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): Description of Jason given in the problem.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's calculate these probabilities step by step.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, so:
     \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
     \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Considering the description, Jason seems to exhibit traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, less interest in writing or drawing).
   - While it's subjective, we can reasonably assume that \( P(D|C) \) is higher than \( P(D|H) \):
     Let's assume \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \) and \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Total probability** \( P(D) \):
   \[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
   \[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.8) \cdot (0.25)}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is about 0.5714.
