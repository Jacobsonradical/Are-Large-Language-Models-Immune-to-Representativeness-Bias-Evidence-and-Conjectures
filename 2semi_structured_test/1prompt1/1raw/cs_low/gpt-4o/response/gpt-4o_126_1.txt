To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this study, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here’s how we approach it:

1. **Number of Professors in Each Category**:
   - Professors in Computer Science (CS): 25
   - Professors in the Humanities: 75
   - Total Professors: 100

2. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - The probability of choosing a computer science professor at random from the sample, \( P(CS) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - The probability of choosing a humanities professor at random from the sample, \( P(H) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Likelihood**:
   - The problem only gives us the description of Jason but not explicit likelihoods. However, we will infer based on the provided description, particularly focusing on activities and traits that are likely associated with a computer science (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) versus a humanities professor.

Assuming that the description fits better with a computer science professor, which seems reasonable given Jason’s interest in coding and mathematical puzzles, we can denote:

   - Probability of the description given Jason is in CS, \( P(D|CS) \): High but unspecified. We can assume a relatively high number, say 0.9.
   - Probability of the description given Jason is in humanities, \( P(D|H) \): Lower probability, because the interests are less aligned. We can assume a lower number, say 0.1.

4. **Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]

Where:

\[ 
P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) 
\]

\[ 
P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) 
\]
\[ 
P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 
\]
\[ 
P(D) = 0.3 
\]

Now, calculating \(P(CS|D)\):

\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} 
\]
\[ 
P(CS|D) = 0.75 
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

So, the answer in the required format is:

```json
{"probability": "0.75"}
```
