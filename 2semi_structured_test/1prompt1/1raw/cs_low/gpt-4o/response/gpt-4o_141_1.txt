To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that the description fits Jason.

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Let's calculate each component:

1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - Therefore, the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor:
     \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \( P(A^c) \)**
   - Similarly, the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor:
     \[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \)**
   - Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it seems more likely that he might be a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.
   - We can estimate these probabilities based upon the description, but without specific data, let's make reasonable assumptions. Suppose the likelihood that a description corresponds to a computer science professor is higher.

     Assume:
     \[ P(B|A) = 0.7 \]
     \[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \]

4. **Total probability \( P(B) \)**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.7 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.175 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.25 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.7 \times 0.25}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.175}{0.25} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.7 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.7.
