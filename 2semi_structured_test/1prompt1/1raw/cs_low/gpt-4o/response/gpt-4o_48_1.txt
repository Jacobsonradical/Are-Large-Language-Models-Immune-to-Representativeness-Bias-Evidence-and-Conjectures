To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

The prior probabilities are:
- Probability (Computer science professor) = 25/100 = 0.25
- Probability (Humanities professor) = 75/100 = 0.75

We need to incorporate the description of Jason and how likely this description (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.) fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Let's define:
- P(CS | Description) = Probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description
- P(Hum | Description) = Probability that Jason is a humanities professor given the description

We use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{P(Description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]

where:
- \( P(Description | CS) \) = Probability of the description given a CS professor
- \( P(Description | Hum) \) = Probability of the description given a Humanities professor
- \( P(Description) \) = Total Probability of the description 
\[ P(Description) = P(Description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description | Hum) \times P(Hum) \]

Given the information, it is reasonable to think that someone who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles is more likely to be a computer science professor. Let’s assume:
- \( P(Description | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(Description | Hum) = 0.1 \)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{((0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75))} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.225}{(0.225 + 0.075)} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS | Description) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is 0.75.

Here’s the answer in the required format:

{"probability": "0.75"}
