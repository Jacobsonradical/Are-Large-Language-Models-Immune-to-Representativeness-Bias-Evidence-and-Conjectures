To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the given description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of selecting a computer science professor at random.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability of selecting a humanities professor at random.

Given the numbers in the study:
- There are 25 computer science professors (\( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \))
- There are 75 humanities professors (\( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \))

Next, we need the likelihoods (these are typically more subjective and based on the description given):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a computer science professor matches the description of Jason.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that a humanities professor matches the description of Jason.

Given Jason's description (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, does not enjoy drawing or writing), it seems more consistent with a computer science professor than with a humanities professor. Suppose we estimate these subjective probabilities as follows:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (High likelihood for a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (Lower likelihood for a humanities professor)

Now we need to compute the total probability of the description:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.6.
