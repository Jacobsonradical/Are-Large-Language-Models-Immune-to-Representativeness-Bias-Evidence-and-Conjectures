To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, you can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Given the problem setup:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Jason's description likely fits a stereotype of a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and lack of interest in writing.

Bayes' theorem is stated as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a professor is from computer science, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason’s description.

You need to compare \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the likelihood of the description given he is not a computer science professor).

Assume:
1. The description fits well with a computer science professor, so let’s assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \).
2. The description fits less well with humanities professors, so let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

We can compute \( P(B) \) as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(0.6\).

The answer in the requested format is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
