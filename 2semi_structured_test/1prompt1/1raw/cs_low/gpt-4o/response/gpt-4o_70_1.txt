To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that event A occurs given that B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that event B occurs given that A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A occurring.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event B occurring.

In this case:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description of Jason.

First, let's define the appropriate probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description being observed.

We have:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (since the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor).

Now, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B) \):
- \( P(B|A) \): This is higher for computer science professors based on the description (Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles which align more with traits common among computer science professors).
- \( P(B|A') \): This is the probability of the description if Jason were a humanities professor, which we infer to be lower due to the less common alignment with humanities professors' traits.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the alignment with computer science traits)
- \( P(B|A') = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the misalignment with humanities traits)

Next, compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
Where \( P(A') \) is the probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \)

Thus:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{200}{275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{40}{55} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.

Answer:
{"probability": "0.727"}
