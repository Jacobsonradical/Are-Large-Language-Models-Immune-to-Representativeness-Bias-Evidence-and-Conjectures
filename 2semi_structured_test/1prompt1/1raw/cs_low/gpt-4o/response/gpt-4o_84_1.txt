To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description given (which fits Jason).

We need to find \( P(A|D) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]

We know:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the description is of a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(B) \): The prior probability that the description is of a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To use Bayes' theorem, we also need \( P(D|A) \) and \( P(D|B) \), the likelihoods of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor or a humanities professor, respectively.

From the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more characteristic of computer science professors.
- Jason is conservative, careful, talented, and ambitious, and enjoys jogging. These traits can apply to both groups, but the specific interest in coding and mathematical puzzles strongly hints towards computer science.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(D|A) \): The probability that Jason fits the description given he is a computer science professor is high. Let’s estimate it as 0.9.
- \( P(D|B) \): The probability that Jason fits the description given he is a humanities professor is lower due to his particular interest in coding and mathematical puzzles. Let's estimate it as 0.1.

Now we calculate \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|D) \):
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
