To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the description given.

Firstly, we need to calculate these probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. Since there are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors in total, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is one of the humanities professors. Since there are 75 humanities professors and 100 professors in total, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given the description of Jason, we must consider whether his traits are more likely to match a computer science professor or a humanities professor. Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his disinterest in writing and drawing suggests he is more likely a computer science professor.

Since exact probabilities for \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are not given, we can reasonably assume based on the description that \( P(B|A) \) is much higher than \( P(B|\neg A) \).

To simplify, let's assume (based on the nature of the activities and interests described):
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
