To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update our probability estimates given new evidence.

First, let's outline what we know, including the base rates and the likelihoods:

1. The base rate (prior probability) for a professor being from computer science:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. The base rate for a professor being from the humanities:
\[ P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of getting the description given the professor's field:

3. The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \), is expected to be higher or makes more sense given the traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles.

4. The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor, \( P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \), is expected to be lower since enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles is less common in humanities.

Instead of assigning exact values to these likelihoods without specific statistical data, we will qualitatively agree that:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) > P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \]

For simplicity, let's assume:
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) = 0.8 \quad (\text{high likelihood}) \]
\[ P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) = 0.2 \quad (\text{low likelihood}) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description} \mid \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description} \mid \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(\text{CS} \mid \text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \approx \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
