To assess the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes’ theorem calculates the probability of a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this context:

- Let \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) represent the given personality description of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes’ theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

First, let’s define the components:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): Total probability of the description.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now we need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given Jason's penchant for coding and mathematical puzzles, it's reasonable to assume he fits the profile of a computer science professor more than a humanities professor.

For simplicity, let's assign some reasonable estimates:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \) (Jason’s characteristics are very likely for a computer science professor).
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \) (Jason’s characteristics are less likely for a humanities professor).

Now, we can determine \( P(D) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) P(C) + P(D|H) P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes’ theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) P(C)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is approximately 0.5714.
