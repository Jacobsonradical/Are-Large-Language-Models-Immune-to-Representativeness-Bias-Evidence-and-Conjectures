To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem, which helps us compute the probability of an event given prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Given:
- The description of Jason.
- The prior probabilities that a randomly selected professor is from computer science (25 out of 100) or the humanities (75 out of 100).

First, define:
- \( P(CS) = \) Probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) = \) Probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D \mid CS) = \) Probability that Jason fits the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) = \) Probability that Jason fits the description given he is a humanities professor.

From the problem:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

For \( P(D \mid CS) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), we will use qualitative judgments based on the description, which seems to align more with typical interests and personality traits of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than a humanities professor. Without precise numbers, let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.9 \) (highly likely Jason fits the description if he is a CS professor)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (less likely Jason fits the description if he is a humanities professor)

Now, Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3}
\]

\[
P(CS \mid D) = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, is:
\[
{"probability": "0.75"}
\]
