To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We are given the following:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, P(CS), is 25/100 = 0.25.
- The prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, P(H), is 75/100 = 0.75.

Given the description of Jason, we need to estimate how likely it is that the description matches a computer science professor versus a humanities professor.

Let's denote:
- P(D | CS) as the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D | H) as the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Assuming Jason's characteristics are more aligned with a computer science professor, and assuming that such detailed description points more towards a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles), let's assign reasonable estimates for both probabilities. 

Let's assume:
- P(D | CS) = 0.9 (a high probability because the description aligns well with computer science characteristics)
- P(D | H) = 0.1 (a low probability because the description does not align typically with humanities characteristics)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to calculate P(CS | D):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
\]

However, we first need P(D), the total probability of the description, which is a weighted sum of the probabilities of the description under both hypotheses:

\[
P(D) = P(D | CS) \times P(CS) + P(D | H) \times P(H)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75)
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now we can find P(CS | D):

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3}
\]

\[
P(CS | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Hence, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
