To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Here's the information we have:
- Total number of professors: 100
  - Computer Science Professors: 25
  - Humanities Professors: 75
- We need to find the probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor given his description.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a Computer Science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a Humanities professor.
- \( D \) as the event that Jason's description matches the given profile.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor given his profile.

Bayesâ€™ theorem formula is:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   \[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihoods** (assuming the description):
   We need \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). However, let's simplify: Based on the description of Jason (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing), it is more likely that he fits the Computer Science profile. So we can make reasonable estimates:
   - Suppose \( P(D|C) = 0.8 \)
   - Suppose \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) 

3. **Total Probability**:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a Computer Science professor given the description is approximately 0.727.
Here is the response in the required format:
