To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor,
- \( B \) is the event of getting Jason's description.

Given:
- Total number of professors = 100
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) (Probability that Jason is a computer science professor) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \( P(\neg A) \) (Probability that Jason is a humanities professor) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description (likes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, etc.) given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor.

Given Jason's description strongly aligns with characteristics typical of a computer science professor (e.g., coding and solving mathematical puzzles), let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) \approx 0.1 \)

To find \( P(B) \) (the total probability of Jason's description), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).

Here is the answer in the required format:
