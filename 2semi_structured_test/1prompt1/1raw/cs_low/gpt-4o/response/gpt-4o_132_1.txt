To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is defined as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is in computer science given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is in computer science.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is in computer science (the base rate).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's assign values to these probabilities:

- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that Jason is from computer science, is \(\frac{25}{100}\) because there are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total professors.
\[ P(A) = 0.25 \]

- The complementary prior probability \( P(A^c) \), the probability that Jason is from the humanities, is \(\frac{75}{100}\).
\[ P(A^c) = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \):

- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the description applies to a computer science professor, given that Jason enjoys activities like coding and mathematical puzzles, which are common in computer science, is likely to be higher. Let’s assume it’s, say, \( 0.8 \).

- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that the description applies to a humanities professor, is likely lower since these activities are less common in the humanities. Let's assume it’s, say, \( 0.2 \).

Now, we compute the overall probability \( P(B) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

Therefore, the answer is:
{"probability": "0.571"}
