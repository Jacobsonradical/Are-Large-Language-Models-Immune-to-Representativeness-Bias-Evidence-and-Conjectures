Given that we have descriptions of 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, we start by noting the prior probabilities. The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor is \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \). Conversely, the probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor is \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Now, we need to look at the likelihood of the description fitting the computer science (CS) versus humanities professors. Jason's traits such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles are indicative of a computer science professor, and less likely for a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is the likelihood of the description given a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the marginal probability of the description.

Since \( P(\text{description}) \) can be expanded as: 

\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \times P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \times P(\text{Humanities}) \]

Assuming \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is much higher than \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \) given the specific traits mentioned:

Let's assign a reasonable value based on assumptions:
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \approx 0.9 \) (high likelihood due to coding and mathematical interests)
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \approx 0.1 \) (low likelihood due to the same reasons)

Now, substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.3 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{(0.9 \times 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the computed probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
