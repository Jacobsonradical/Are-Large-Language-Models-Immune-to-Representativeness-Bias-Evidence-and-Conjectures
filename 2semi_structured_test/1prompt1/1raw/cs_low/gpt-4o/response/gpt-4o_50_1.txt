To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we will use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let:
- \(CS\) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\) be the description provided for Jason.

We need to compute \(P(CS | D)\):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

We already know the following:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

For \( P(D) \), the total probability of observing the description, we use:

\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Now, we need to estimate \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \).

Given Jason's activities and preferences (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, highly creative but not enjoying drawing or writing), it seems more likely that the description fits a computer science professor. Here we use subjective judgement (which in real life would need proper quantification through data):

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \)

Now, we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, we compute \( P(CS | D) \):

\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.57.

So the answer is:

```json
{"probability": "0.5714"}
