To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base rates** (priors):
   - There are 25 computer science professors.
   - There are 75 humanities professors.
   - Total professors: 100.

   Therefore, the prior probability \( P(A_{CS}) \) that Jason is a computer science professor is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   The prior probability \( P(A_{H}) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D|A_{CS}) \): The probability of the description "Jason" given that he is a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|A_{H}) \): The probability of the description "Jason" given that he is a humanities professor.

   The description points towards traits more commonly associated with a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Letâ€™s assume:
   - \( P(D|A_{CS}) \) (likelihood of a computer science professor having these traits) is relatively high, say 0.8.
   - \( P(D|A_{H}) \) (likelihood of a humanities professor having these traits) is relatively low, say 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   Using Bayes' Theorem:

   \[
   P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{P(D|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS})}{P(D|A_{CS}) \cdot P(A_{CS}) + P(D|A_{H}) \cdot P(A_{H})}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   P(A_{CS}|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714
   \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\boxed{ \{ "probability": "0.5714" \} }
\]
