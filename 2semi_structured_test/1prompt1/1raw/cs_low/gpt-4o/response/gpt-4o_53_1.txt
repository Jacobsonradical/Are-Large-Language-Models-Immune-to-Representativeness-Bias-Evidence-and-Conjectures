To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in this sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Computer Science (CS) group: P(CS) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the Humanities (HUM) group: P(HUM) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to compute the likelihood of the description fitting a CS professor and a Humanities professor. Let’s denote the description as \( D \).

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description \( D \) is:
     \[
     P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)}
     \]
   - Similarly, the probability that Jason is a Humanities professor given the description \( D \) is:
     \[
     P(HUM|D) = \frac{P(D|HUM) \times P(HUM)}{P(D)}
     \]

4. **Normalization**:
   - The denominator \( P(D) \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|HUM) \times P(HUM)
     \]

Given the description provided, Jason’s interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging) align more with the typical profile of a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor.

Let's make a reasonable assumption to quantify these likelihoods:
- Let’s assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood given the description fits a CS professor well).
- Let’s assume \( P(D|HUM) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood given the description fits a Humanities professor less well).

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{(0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75)} = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
