To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's outline the known details:

1. There are 25 computer science professors.
2. There are 75 humanities professors.
3. Jason's description needs to match with the personality traits that we might expect for either category.

We need:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability of being a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of Jason's description.

The prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Since we do not have exact conditional probabilities like \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \) from statistical data, we should rely on our intuition derived from the description of Jason and the typical activities and traits related to each field:
- Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles (more indicative of a computer science professor).
- Is highly creative but does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be slightly against the typical profile of many humanities professors.

Let's assume the following reasonable estimations for the sake of the calculation:
\[ P(D|CS) \approx 0.8 \]  (because the description is quite fitting for a computer science professor)
\[ P(D|H) \approx 0.2 \]  (because the description is less fitting for a humanities professor)

Now, we compute the overall probability of the description \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
