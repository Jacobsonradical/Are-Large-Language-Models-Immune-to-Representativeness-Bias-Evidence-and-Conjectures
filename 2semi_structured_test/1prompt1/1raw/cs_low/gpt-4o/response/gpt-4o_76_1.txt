To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to compute \( P(CS | \text{description}) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(\text{description}) \) is the overall probability of the description.

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - For simplicity, assume the given description is more likely for a computer science professor based on interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
   - Let \( P(\text{description} | CS) \) be a subjective high probability, say \( 0.9 \).
   - Let \( P(\text{description} | H) \) be a subjective lower probability, say \( 0.2 \).

3. **Overall Probability of the Description, \( P(\text{description}) \):**
\[ P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(\text{description} | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375 \]

Putting it all together:
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(\text{description})} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(CS | \text{description}) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample given his description is:
