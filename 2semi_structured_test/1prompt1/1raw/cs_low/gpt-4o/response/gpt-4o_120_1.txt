To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|J) = \frac{P(J|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(J|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(J|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|J) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(J|CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(J|H) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being a humanities professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors, hence:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To estimate \( P(J|CS) \) and \( P(J|H) \), we should consider the traits described and how likely they are to be found in computer science professors compared to humanities professors based on common stereotypes. Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles are more strongly associated with the field of computer science.

For simplicity, let's make an assumption:
- Given Jason's liking for coding and mathematical puzzles, suppose the probability that he matches the description given he is a computer scientist (\( P(J|CS) \)) is quite high, say \( 0.8 \).
- Given Jason's traits do not particularly align with typical humanities professors, assume \( P(J|H) \) is lower, say \( 0.2 \).

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|J) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS|J) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(CS|J) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|J) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
