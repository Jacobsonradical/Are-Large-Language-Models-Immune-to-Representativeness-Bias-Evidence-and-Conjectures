To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probabilities of two events, where one conditions or affects the other. Here, we want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

We'll use the following notation:
- Let \( C \) denote the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) denote the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) denote Jason's description.

We need to find \( P(C \mid D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We'll break this down:

1. \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a given professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a given professor is a humanities professor.
3. \( P(D \mid C) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
4. \( P(D \mid H) \): The probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.
5. \( P(D) \): The total probability of Jason's description occurring.

Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors:

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

To proceed, we need to make some reasonable assumptions about the probabilities \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \). Given Jason's interest in coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, and considering he does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more likely these traits would be aligned with a computer science professor rather than a humanities professor. 

Let's assume:
- \( P(D \mid C) = 0.8 \): There is an 80% chance that someone with Jason's profile is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \): There is a 20% chance that someone with Jason's profile is a humanities professor.

Now, using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
