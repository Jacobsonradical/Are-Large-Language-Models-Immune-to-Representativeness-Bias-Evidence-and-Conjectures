To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of professors**: 
   - Computer science professors: 25
   - Humanities professors: 75
   - Total professors: 100

2. **Determine the probability of selecting a professor from each discipline**:
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \): \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(Hum) \): \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

3. **Assess the likelihood of the description fitting a professor in each discipline**:
   - We need to estimate how likely it is for the description (conservative, careful, likes coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, dislikes drawing or writing) to fit a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. Without detailed empirical data, we can make a reasoned assumption:
     - Given the interests (coding, solving mathematical puzzles), it is more likely that Jason is a computer science professor.

4. **Assign these likelihoods**:
   - Let \( P(description | CS) \) be the probability that the description fits a computer science professor. This is likely high, say 0.9.
   - Let \( P(description | Hum) \) be the probability that the description fits a humanities professor. This is likely low, say 0.1.

5. **Apply Bayes' theorem** to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description:
   
   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{P(description | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(description | CS) \times P(CS) + P(description | Hum) \times P(Hum)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   P(CS | description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{(0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75)}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
   \]

   \[
   = \frac{0.225}{0.3}
   \]

   \[
   = 0.75
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
