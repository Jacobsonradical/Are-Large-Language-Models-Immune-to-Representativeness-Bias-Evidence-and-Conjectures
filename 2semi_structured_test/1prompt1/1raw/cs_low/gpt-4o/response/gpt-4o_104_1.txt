To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.
- A description of Jason that needs to be classified based on his personality traits and interests.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of Jason's description.

Calculate the prior probabilities and total probability:

1. Prior probability that a professor is from computer science (\( P(A) \)):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. Prior probability that a professor is from the humanities (\( P(H) \)):
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to estimate \( P(B|CS) \) and \( P(B|H) \):
- \( P(B|CS) \): Probability of the description given that he is a computer science professor. Given Jason's coding and mathematical interests, we might estimate this as high, say 0.8.
- \( P(B|H) \): Probability of the description given that he is a humanities professor. Given that he doesn't like drawing or writing and enjoys coding, it's likely low, say 0.1.

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.20 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.20}{0.275} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{20}{27.5} \]
\[ P(CS|B) \approx 0.727 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
