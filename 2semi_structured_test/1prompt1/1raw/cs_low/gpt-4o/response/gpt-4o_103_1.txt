Let's apply Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

We need to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the detailed description of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We also need to find the probabilities of the description \( D \) given each category.

Let's assume that the detailed description is more likely to describe a computer science professor than a humanities professor because it involves coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical activities of computer science professors.

Let’s assume:
- \( P(D|C) \) = 0.8 (high likelihood Jason’s description fits a computer science professor)
- \( P(D|H) \) = 0.2 (lower likelihood Jason’s description fits a humanities professor)

Now, we can use the total probability theorem:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

{"probability": "0.5714"}
