To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define:
- \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor
- \( B \): The description fits Jason

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, prior probabilities are \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

To proceed, we need to make educated guesses about \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Given Jason's interests in coding, mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, he seems to fit the profile of a computer science professor more closely than a humanities professor. Therefore, we can make the following reasonable assumptions:
- \( P(B|A) \) is relatively high, let's estimate \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is relatively lower, let's estimate \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the description \( B \):

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
\]

\[
P(B) = (0.2) + (0.15) = 0.35
\]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35}
\]

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.571
\]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
