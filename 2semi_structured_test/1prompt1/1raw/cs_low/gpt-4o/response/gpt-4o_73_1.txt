To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the description given of Jason.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

To proceed, we need estimates of \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given the provided details, Jason's interests and attributes—such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles—are more typical of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Therefore, we can assume:

- \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D|H) \) is relatively low.

For illustration, suppose:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \)

Now we calculate \( P(D) \) as follows:
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(C|D) \):
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{"probability": "0.75"}
