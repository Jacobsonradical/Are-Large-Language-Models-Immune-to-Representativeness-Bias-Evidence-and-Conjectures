To calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Based on the provided information, here are the steps to find the probability:

1. **Define the Events**:
   - \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
   - \( B \): Jason is not a computer science professor (so he is a humanities professor).

2. **Find Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
   - \( P(B) \): Probability that a randomly chosen professor is from humanities.

   Since there are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Determine Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(D|A) \): Probability that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
   - \( P(D|B) \): Probability that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

   Judging by common stereotypes and the given description (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, creative but not into drawing or writing), it is more likely that Jason matches a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's denote these probabilities with some assumed but reasonable values:
   \[
   P(D|A) = 0.9 \quad \text{(High likelihood based on Jason's description)}
   \]
   \[
   P(D|B) = 0.2 \quad \text{(Lower likelihood based on opposite of Jason's description)}
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description \( D \), calculated as:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]

   Now calculate \( P(A|D) \):
   \[
   P(A|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[
\text{{"probability"}}: \text{{"0.6"}}
\]
