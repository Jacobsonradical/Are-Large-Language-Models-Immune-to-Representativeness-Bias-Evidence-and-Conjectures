To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we should use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \(C\) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We aim to find \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description \(D\).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\) is the likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

First, we can calculate the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors, so \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors, so \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to estimate the likelihoods \(P(D|C)\) and \(P(D|H)\). Given Jasonâ€™s description that he enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, jogging, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more characteristic of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

To quantify this:
- Assign a higher likelihood to \(P(D|C)\) assuming coding and mathematical puzzles are strong indicators.
- Assign a lower likelihood to \(P(D|H)\) as these traits are less common among humanities professors.

Let's reasonably assume (for estimation purposes):
- \(P(D|C) = 0.8\)
- \(P(D|H) = 0.2\)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]

\[ P(C|D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
