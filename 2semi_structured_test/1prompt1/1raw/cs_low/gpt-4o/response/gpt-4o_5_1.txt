Let's begin by analyzing the information provided. We know there are two groups: computer science professors and humanities professors. The sizes of these groups are:
- Computer Science Professors: 25
- Humanities Professors: 75

Jason's description includes interests and characteristics that align more closely with typical traits of a computer science professor. However, to determine the probability accurately, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem: 

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

We start with the priors:
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (where \( A' \) represents being a humanities professor)

Next, we consider the likelihoods. While these are more subjective, based on the interests and characteristics:

Assume:
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor) is high, say 1, because Jason's interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles are strongly indicative of computer science.
- \( P(B|A') \) (probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor) is low, say 0.1, as these interests are less indicative of a humanities professor.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (1 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.25 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.325 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.25}{0.325} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.769 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.769.

The final answer is: 
```{"probability": "0.769"}```
