To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's denote the following events:

- C: Jason is a computer science professor.
- H: Jason is a humanities professor.

We are given:
- P(C) = the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor = 25/100 = 0.25
- P(H) = the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor = 75/100 = 0.75

We need to find P(C|D), where D is the description of Jason.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- P(D|C) is the probability of the description if Jason is a computer science professor.
- P(D|H) is the probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor.
- P(D) is the total probability of the description and can be calculated as:

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Without specific numeric values for P(D|C) and P(D|H), we can make a reasonable assumption that the described traits are more common in computer science professors due to Jason's liking for coding and mathematical puzzles. Let's assume:

- P(D|C) = 0.8 (high likelihood that a computer science professor would fit the description)
- P(D|H) = 0.1 (low likelihood that a humanities professor would fit the description)

Now we can compute P(D):

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \approx \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727. 

Thus, the result is:
