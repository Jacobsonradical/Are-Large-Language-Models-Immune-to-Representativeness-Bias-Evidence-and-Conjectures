To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Initially, we have the counts:
- \( CS_{\text{count}} = 25 \)
- \( H_{\text{count}} = 75 \)

Thus, the prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

To use Bayes' theorem, we will need \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \). Based on the given description, Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more common traits in computer science professors than in humanities professors. Without specific probabilities, we must rely on logical inference.

Suppose:
- \( P(D | CS) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood due to coding and problem-solving interests)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.2 \) (low likelihood considering humanities traits)

Now, we compute \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.5714 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, based on the provided description, is approximately 0.5714.
