To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Total Sample Size**: There are 100 professors in the study (25 computer science + 75 humanities).

2. **Base Rate (Prior Probability)**:
   - Probability of a professor being in computer science, P(CS): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of a professor being in humanities, P(H): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

3. **Likelihood**:
   - We need to assess how likely Jason's description fits a computer science professor versus a humanities professor. While we don't have explicit likelihoods, the description suggests Jason has interests and characteristics more aligned with computer science (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, disliking drawing or writing).

For a basic estimate, we'll assume the likelihood of Jason's description fitting a computer science professor is higher than it fitting a humanities professor.

4. **Posterior Probability** (Bayes' Theorem):

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) * P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) * P(CS) + P(D \mid H) * P(H)} \]

Where:
- \(P(D \mid CS)\) = Probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \(P(D \mid H)\) = Probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Without precise likelihoods, we'll estimate \(P(D \mid CS)\) being significantly higher. For simplicity, let's assume \(P(D \mid CS) = 0.8\) (i.e., 80% of the time such a description would come from a computer science professor).

By contrast, let's assume \(P(D \mid H) = 0.2\) (i.e., 20% of the time such a description would come from a humanities professor).

Now calculate using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.8 * 0.25}{0.8 * 0.25 + 0.2 * 0.75} = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability:
