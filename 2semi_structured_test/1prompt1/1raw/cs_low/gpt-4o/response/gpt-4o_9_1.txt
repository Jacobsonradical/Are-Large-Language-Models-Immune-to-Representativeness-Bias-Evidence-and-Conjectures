To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We need to calculate \( P(C | D) \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description.

First, let's establish the priors:
- The total number of professors is 100.
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- So, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, let's reason about the likelihoods:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities more commonly associated with computer science professors.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, more commonly associated with humanities professors.

This makes it reasonable to assume:
- \( P(D | C) \) is relatively high.
- \( P(D | H) \) is relatively low.

Since we do not have explicit numbers for \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we will assume reasonable estimates:
- Let \( P(D | C) \approx 0.8 \)
- Let \( P(D | H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now, using the law of total probability to find \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.275 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(C | D) \approx 0.727 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
{"probability": "0.727"}
