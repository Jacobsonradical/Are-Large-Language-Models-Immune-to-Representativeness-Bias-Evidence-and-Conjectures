To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which incorporates base rates and likelihoods to calculate the conditional probability. Here's the relevant information we have:

1. Number of computer science professors (CS): 25
2. Number of humanities professors (H): 75
3. Total professors: 100

We need to evaluate the probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description. Let:

- \( P(CS) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a CS professor: \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor: \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, let's consider the likelihoods:

- \( P(D \mid CS) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a CS professor.
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor.

While we don't have exact probabilities, we use our judgment based on the description. Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and the fact that he does not enjoy drawing or writing, aligns more closely with the expected traits of a CS professor than those of a humanities professor.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume the likelihoods are:
- \( P(D \mid CS) = 0.9 \) (high as the description fits well)
- \( P(D \mid H) = 0.1 \) (low as the description doesnâ€™t fit well)

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D \mid CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS \mid D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is: {"probability": "0.75"}
