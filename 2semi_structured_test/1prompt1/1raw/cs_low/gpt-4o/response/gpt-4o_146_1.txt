To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:

- \( A \) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor."
- \( B \) is the event "Jason fits the given description."

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Prior Probability**: 
   \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **Complement Prior Probability**:
   \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **Likelihood**:
   \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the description fits a computer science professor.
   \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the description fits a humanities professor.

   Based on the description, it seems more likely that Jason is a computer science professor than a humanities professor due to his interests and skills. 

   For calculation purposes, let's assume:
   \[
   P(B|A) = 0.9 \quad \text{(since the description strongly matches a computer science professor)}
   \]
   \[
   P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \quad \text{(since the description poorly matches a humanities professor)}
   \]

4. **Total Probability of B**:
   \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description regardless of the professor's field.
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability**:
   Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \).
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is \( 0.75 \).
