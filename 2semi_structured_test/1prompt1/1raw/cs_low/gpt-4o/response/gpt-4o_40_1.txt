To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:

- \( P(CS) \) : The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \) : The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|CS) \) : The probability of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) : The probability of the description given that the person is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) : The total probability of the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Calculating each term:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   \[
   P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   We need estimates for \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since Jason's description fits characteristics like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it's reasonable to assume a higher likelihood for computer science professors. Let's use educated guesses:
   \[
   P(D|CS) \approx 0.9
   \]
   \[
   P(D|H) \approx 0.1
   \]

3. **Total probability of the description**:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
   \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
   \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\{ "probability": "0.75" \}
\]
