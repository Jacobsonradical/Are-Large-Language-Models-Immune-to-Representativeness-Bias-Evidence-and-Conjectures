To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem uses the following formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of Jason's description.

Let's define:
- Event \( A \): Jason is a computer science professor.
- Event \( \neg A \): Jason is a humanities professor.
- Event \( B \): The description matches Jason.

First, we need to determine the individual parts of the formula:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   There are 25 computer science professors and 100 professors overall.
   \[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   There are 75 humanities professors and 100 professors overall.
   \[ P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor and humanities professor, respectively.

Since the description aligns more with stereotypical traits of computer science professors (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles) rather than humanities professors, we assume:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of a computer science professor having Jason's description, is relatively high, let's say \( 0.8 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability of a humanities professor having Jason's description, is relatively low, let's say \( 0.1 \).

4. \( P(B) \): The overall probability of the description.
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.075 \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.275 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.727 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.
