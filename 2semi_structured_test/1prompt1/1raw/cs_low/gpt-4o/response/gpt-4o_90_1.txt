To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

We need to calculate the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description. 

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) represent the event that Jason matches the given description.

We are looking for \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to compute the following:
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The probability that Jason matches the description given he is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The probability that Jason matches the description given he is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \): The total probability of Jason matching the description.

First, the prior probabilities:
\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, we can assume that he more likely matches the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) = 0.9 \): High probability since the description fits well with typical activities of a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \): Lower probability since the description does not fit as well with typical activities of a humanities professor.

Using these estimates:

\[ P(D|C) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \]

Now we calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.375 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.6 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
