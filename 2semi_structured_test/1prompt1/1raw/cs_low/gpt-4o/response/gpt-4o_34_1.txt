To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Let's denote:
- \( CS \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

Given data:
- Number of computer science professors = 25
- Number of humanities professors = 75

Therefore:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

We need to assess the likelihood of Jason's description given each profession. Based on the description provided, the traits are more commonly associated with computer science (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles).

Assuming the probabilities of Jason's description are denoted:
\[ P(B|CS) \approx 0.9 \] (a high probability because the traits align well with computer science)
\[ P(B|H) \approx 0.1 \] (a low probability because the traits do not align well with humanities)

The total probability \( P(B) \) is calculated by the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{P(B|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|B) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
