To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be stated as:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the overall probability of the description \( D \) across all professors.

Let's break down the components of the formula:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is in computer science.
\[
P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen professor is in the humanities.
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

To compute \( P(D) \), we need to consider both \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
\[ 
P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) 
\]

3. \( P(D|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Jason's description seems more aligned with traits typically associated with computer science professors, such as enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles. 

For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(D|CS) = 0.8 \) (an assumption based on the description being highly indicative of computer science traits).

4. \( P(D|H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Given the description, it's less likely for a humanities professor to have these specific traits.

For simplicity, let’s assume \( P(D|H) = 0.2 \) (an assumption based on the description being less indicative of humanities traits).

Now we can compute \( P(D) \):

\[
P(D) = P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|H) \times P(H) 
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.25) + (0.2 \times 0.75) 
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.35 
\]

Finally, we can compute \( P(CS|D) \):

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D)} 
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} 
\]
\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} 
\]
\[
P(CS|D) \approx 0.5714 
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:

\[
{"probability": "0.5714"}
\]
