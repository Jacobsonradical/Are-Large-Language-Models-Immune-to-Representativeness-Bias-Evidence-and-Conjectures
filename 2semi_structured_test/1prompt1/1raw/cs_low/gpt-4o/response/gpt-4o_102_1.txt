To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors rather than a humanities professor, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

We start by defining the following:

- \( P(\text{CS}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science.
- \( P(\text{HU}) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D | \text{CS}) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from computer science.
- \( P(D | \text{HU}) \): The probability of the description given that the professor is from the humanities.
- \( P(D) \): The overall probability of the description.

We want to find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given the description \( D \):
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(D)} \]

We have the following prior probabilities:
\[ P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(\text{HU}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

However, without specific probabilities \( P(D | \text{CS}) \) and \( P(D | \text{HU}) \), we need to make some intuitive assumptions based on the description. Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, it appears more likely he is a computer science professor. He also does not enjoy drawing or writing, which may be more associated with humanities professors. 

To proceed, let's assume:
\[ P(D | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \] \[ P(D | \text{HU}) = 0.1 \]

Using these assumptions, we can calculate \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(D | \text{HU}) \cdot P(\text{HU}) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS} | D) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
