To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): The description of Jason.

We need to compute \(P(C|D)\), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(C)\) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|C)\) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- The probability that Jason is a computer science professor, \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- The probability that Jason is a humanities professor, \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\).

Next, we need to assess the likelihood:
- The description mentions traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) that seem more aligned with computer science.
- We will estimate high likelihood for \(P(D|C)\).

Since we don't have exact numbers for how likely these traits are in computer science vs. humanities, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the description. Let's assume:
- \(P(D|C) = 0.9\) (high, because the description aligns well with a computer science professor).
- \(P(D|H) = 0.2\) (lower, because the description is less typical of a humanities professor).

Using the law of total probability for \(P(D)\):
\[P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)\]
\[P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75\]
\[P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15\]
\[P(D) = 0.375\]

Finally, plug these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375}\]
\[P(C|D) = 0.6\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
{\\"probability\\": "0.6"}
