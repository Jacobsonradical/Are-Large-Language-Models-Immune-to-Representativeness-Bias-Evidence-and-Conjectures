To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors.

Let's define the following events:
- \( C \): Jason is a computer science (CS) professor.
- \( H \): Jason is a humanities (H) professor.

We need to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

First, we need some probabilities:
- \( P(C) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a CS professor.
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D|C) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(D|H) \): The likelihood of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

From the problem statement:
- There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Next, we need to assess \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \). Given that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it is more likely that he fits the profile of a CS professor rather than a humanities professor. Without exact numerical values for \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), we can assume:
- \( P(D|C) \): Probability of the description if Jason is a CS professor. Let's assume this is very high, let's say 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \): Probability of the description if Jason is a humanities professor. Let's assume this is much lower, let's say 0.1.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} \]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[ \text{Numerator} = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 = 0.225 \]

\[ \text{Denominator} = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

So,

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \(\boxed{0.75}\).
