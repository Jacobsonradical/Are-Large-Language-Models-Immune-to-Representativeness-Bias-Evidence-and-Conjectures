To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the prior probabilities:**
   - Probability of selecting a computer science professor (P(CS)) = \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - Probability of selecting a humanities professor (P(Hum)) = \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Determine the likelihood:**
   - Let's denote the given description by D.
   - We need to estimate the probability of the description D given that the professor is in computer science (P(D|CS)).
   - Similarly, we need to estimate the probability of the description D given that the professor is in the humanities (P(D|Hum)).
   
   Given the details like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, these seem to strongly indicate characteristics typical of someone in computer science rather than humanities. Therefore, we can assume:
   - P(D|CS) > P(D|Hum)

3. **Use Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
   \]

Since we do not have the exact values for P(D|CS) and P(D|Hum), we can make an educated guess about their relative sizes. Assuming coding-related activities are much more likely among computer scientists, we might estimate:
   - P(D|CS) ≈ 0.9
   - P(D|Hum) ≈ 0.1

Now we can plug these into Bayes' formula:

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

4. **Calculate the probability:**

\[
P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75, or 75%.
