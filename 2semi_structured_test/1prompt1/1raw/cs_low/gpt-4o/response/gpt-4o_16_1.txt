Sure, let's calculate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors. This is a typical application of Bayes' theorem.

To find the probability using Bayes' theorem, we need the following:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that any professor is a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of having the detailed description given that the professor is from computer science.
3. \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability of having the detailed description given that the professor is from the humanities.
4. \( P(A^c) \): The prior probability that any professor is a humanities professor.

Given data:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]

However, without specific \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A^c) \) values, it's hard to proceed quantitatively. But letâ€™s reasonably assume Jason's description fits better with his being a computer science professor given his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles, versus the humanities professors.

Let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \) (high probability because the description strongly aligns with computer science interests) and \( P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \) (low probability for the same reason).

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Thus:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.9 \times 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
