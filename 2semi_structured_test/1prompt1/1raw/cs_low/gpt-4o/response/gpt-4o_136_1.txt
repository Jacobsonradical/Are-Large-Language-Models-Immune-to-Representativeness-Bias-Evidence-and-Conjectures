To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem, the probability \( P(A|B) \) can be computed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this scenario:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the given description of Jason.

First, let's define the terms:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100, so \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from the humanities. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100, so \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We also need:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches given that he is a computer science professor. We can assume certain traits (coding, solving mathematical puzzles) are more likely in computer science.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches given that he is a humanities professor.

Given the information in the problem, it is reasonable to assume \( P(B|A) \) (likelihood of him being a computer science professor given the description) is much higher than \( P(B|\neg A) \).

Let's assume:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.9 \): Reasonably high, since his activities and personality traits align well with computer science.
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.1 \): Quite low, as traits like not enjoying drawing or writing and enjoying coding fit computer science more.

Now, we can use these estimates:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

So,
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now we can compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.
