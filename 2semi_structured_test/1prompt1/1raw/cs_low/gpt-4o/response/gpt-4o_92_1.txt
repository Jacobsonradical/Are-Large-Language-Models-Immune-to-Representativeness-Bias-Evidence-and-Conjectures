To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event, is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this context:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event that Jason matches the given description.

We need to determine the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
3. \( P(B|¬A) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
4. \( P(B) \): The total probability of the description.

Let’s calculate each:

1. **The prior probability, \( P(A) \)**:
\( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{\text{Number of CS professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
\( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{\text{Number of Humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **The probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor \( P(B|A) \)**:
Given Jason's enjoyment of coding and mathematical puzzles, these characteristics align more closely with a CS professor. While there isn’t enough data to assign an exact probability, let’s assume lecturers enjoy coding and puzzles likely represent a significant proportion among CS professors. Let’s assume \( P(B|\text{CS}) \approx 0.8 \).

3. **The probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor \( P(B|¬A) \)**:
Humanities professors are less likely to have the interests described (coding and mathematical puzzles). Therefore, let us assume \( P(B|\text{Humanities}) \approx 0.2 \).

4. **The total probability of the description \( P(B) \)**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(B|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.25 + 0.2 \times 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{P(B|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(\text{CS}|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.571.
