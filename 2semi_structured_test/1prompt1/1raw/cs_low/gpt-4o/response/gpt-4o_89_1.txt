To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor from the given description, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Base Rates:**
   - The number of computer science professors (CS) is 25.
   - The number of humanities professors (HUM) is 75.
   - Therefore, the proportion of CS professors is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
   - The proportion of HUM professors is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   Jason seems to match traits more typical of someone in computer science (enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.). While this information is subjective, we assume based on the description characteristics (enjoys coding, solving puzzles, etc.), it's more probable he fits into the CS category.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   - \( P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \).
   - \( P(HUM|Description) = \frac{P(Description|HUM) \times P(HUM)}{P(Description)} \).
   
   We need to find \( P(CS|Description) \).
   
4. **Assumptions:**
   - Let's denote the likelihood of the description given the professor is in computer science as \( P(Description|CS) \).
   - Similarly, let's denote the likelihood of the description given the professor is in humanities as \( P(Description|HUM) \).

   Based on the description provided:
   - It's reasonable to assume that \( P(Description|CS) \) is higher than \( P(Description|HUM) \) because coding, puzzles, and jogging align more closely with someone in computer science.

Let's estimate the likelihood values (subjective but reasonable):
- \( P(Description|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood due to the alignment of activities and characteristics with computer science)
- \( P(Description|HUM) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood as these activities are not typically associated with humanities professors)

5. **Normalization Factor (Total Probability of the Description):**

\[ P(Description) = P(Description|CS) \times P(CS) + P(Description|HUM) \times P(HUM) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.9 \times 0.25) + (0.1 \times 0.75) \]
\[ P(Description) = (0.225) + (0.075) \]
\[ P(Description) = 0.3 \]

6. **Bayes' Theorem Application:**

\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{P(Description|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Description)} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS|Description) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is 0.75.
