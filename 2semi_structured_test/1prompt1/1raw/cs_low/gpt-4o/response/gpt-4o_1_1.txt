To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the detailed computation:

First, we have the priors:

- \( P(A) \): Probability of being a computer science professor = \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(B) \): Probability of being a humanities professor = \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need the likelihoods:

- \( P(D | A) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | B) \): Probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, it fits the stereotype of a computer science professor better than a humanities professor. Thus we assume:
- \( P(D | A) \) is relatively high, let's say 0.8 (since not all computer science professors necessarily enjoy these activities, but many do)
- \( P(D | B) \) is relatively low, let's say 0.2 (because these interests are less common among humanities professors)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D | A) \cdot P(A) + P(D | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(A | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A | D) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(A | D) \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.5714.
