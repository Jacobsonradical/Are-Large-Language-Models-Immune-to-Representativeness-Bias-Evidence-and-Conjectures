To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Probability that the description is of a computer science professor (P(CS)): \[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
   - Probability that the description is of a humanities professor (P(H)): \[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   We need to assess the likelihood of Jason’s interests and traits, given that he is a computer science professor and given that he is a humanities professor. For simplicity, let's assume that the interest in coding and solving mathematical puzzles is much more likely to be found in a computer science professor than in a humanities professor.

   Therefore:
   - Likelihood of being described like Jason given that he is a computer science professor (P(Jason | CS)): Let's assume this to be high, e.g. 0.9.
   - Likelihood of being described like Jason given that he is a humanities professor (P(Jason | H)): Let's assume this to be much lower, e.g. 0.2.

3. **Normalization constant**:
   We need to normalize by the total probability of the description:
   \[
   P(Jason) = P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Jason | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   Substituting in, we get:
   \[
   P(Jason) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]

4. **Posterior probability**:
   Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is:

   \[
   P(CS | Jason) = \frac{P(Jason | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Jason)}
   \]

   Substituting the numbers in, we get:
   \[
   P(CS | Jason) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
