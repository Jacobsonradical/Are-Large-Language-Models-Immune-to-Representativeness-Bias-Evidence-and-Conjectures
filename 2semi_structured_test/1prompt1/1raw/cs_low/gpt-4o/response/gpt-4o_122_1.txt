To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we should use Bayes' theorem and consider the information provided about the descriptions of the professors.

Let's define the following:
- \( C \): being a computer science professor
- \( H \): being a humanities professor
- \( D \): Description matching Jason

We are given:
- The total number of professors: 100 (25 computer science + 75 humanities)
- Prior probability \( P(C) \) of being a computer science professor: 25 / 100 = 0.25
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) of being a humanities professor: 75 / 100 = 0.75

We need to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

We need to estimate:
- \( P(D|C) \), the probability that a computer science professor matches Jason's description.
- \( P(D|H) \), the probability that a humanities professor matches Jason's description.

Given Jason's enjoyment of coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and his lack of interest in drawing or writing, it is more likely that he matches the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's assume:

- \( P(D|C) \) is much higher than \( P(D|H) \). For this estimation, we might assume:
  - \( P(D|C) \approx 0.8 \)
  - \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \)

Now, computing \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.727"}
