To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \(C\): Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(H\): Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(D\): Description fitting the profile of Jason.

We are interested in the probability \(P(C|D)\): the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}\]

Where:
- \(P(C)\): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D|C)\): The likelihood of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \(P(D|H)\): The likelihood of the description given Jason is a humanities professor.
- \(P(D)\): The total probability of the description.

We have:
- \(P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
- \(P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

Assuming that the description provided is more likely to match a computer science professor based on traits like enjoying coding and solving mathematical puzzles, let's assign the probabilities for the likelihoods:
- \(P(D|C)\) = High (we can assume this is quite likely, say \(0.9\))
- \(P(D|H)\) = Low (we can assume this is quite unlikely, say \(0.2\))

Using these values:
\[P(D) = P(D|C)P(C) + P(D|H)P(H)\]
\[P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75\]
\[P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15\]
\[P(D) = 0.375\]

Now, plugging these back into Bayes' theorem:
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375}\]
\[P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.375}\]
\[P(C|D) = 0.6\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:

{"probability": "0.6"}
