To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the event of Jason's given description.

We want to find \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

1. **Prior Probabilities:**

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 total, so:
\[
P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 total, so:
\[
P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

2. **Likelihood:**

We need to estimate \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), the probabilities of Jason's description given that he is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively. Based on the description that Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing, it seems more likely that he is a computer science professor.

For simplicity, let's assume:

- Probability of this description if Jason is a computer science professor \( P(D|C) \) is much higher, let's say \( 0.8 \).
- Probability of this description if Jason is a humanities professor \( P(D|H) \) is much lower, let's say \( 0.2 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood:**

To find \( P(D) \) (the total probability of the description), we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]
\[
P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
\]
\[
P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
\]

4. **Posterior Probability:**

Finally, we substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:

\[
\boxed{"probability": "0.571"}
\]
