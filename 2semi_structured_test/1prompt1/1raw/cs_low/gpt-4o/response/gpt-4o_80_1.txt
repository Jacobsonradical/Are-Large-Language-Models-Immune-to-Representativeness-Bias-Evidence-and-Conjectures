The problem you're dealing with is a classic example of the application of Bayes' Theorem. To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we need to use the following:

- Prior probabilities (the proportion of computer science and humanities professors in the sample)
- Likelihoods (the probability of Jason's description given that he is a computer science or humanities professor)

Here we need to compute:
\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{description})} \]

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Let's assume \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = p \) (the probability of a CS professor having Jason's description)
   - And assume \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) = q \) (the probability of a humanities professor having Jason's description)

3. **Total Probability of Description:**
   - \( P(\text{description}) = P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities}) \)
   - \( P(\text{description}) = p \cdot 0.25 + q \cdot 0.75 \)

However, without concrete values for \( p \) and \( q \), we can only make educated guesses based on the description of Jason (who enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc.). Let's assume, based on the description, that:

- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) \).

If we assume plausible values based on a strong fit of Jason's characteristics to a CS professor:

- \( P(\text{description} | \text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{description} | \text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \)

Then we calculate:

\[ P(\text{description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS} | \text{description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is:
