To find the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. It is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of Jason's description fitting what we know about him.

### Step-by-Step Computation

1. **Prior Probability \(P(A)\)**:
   - There are 25 computer science professors out of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).

2. **Prior Probability \(P(\neg A)\)**:
   - There are 75 humanities professors out of 100 professors.
   - Therefore, \( P(\neg A) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

3. **Likelihood Probability \(P(B|A)\)**:
   - The probability of Jason fitting his description given that he is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical of a computer science professor. Informally, let's assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).

4. **Likelihood Probability \(P(B|\neg A)\)**:
   - The probability of Jason fitting his description given that he is a humanities professor. He enjoys coding and mathematical puzzles, which are less typical for humanities professors. Informally, let's assume \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

5. **Marginal Probability \(P(B)\)**:
   - The total probability of Jason fitting his description.
   - Using the law of total probability: 
     \[
     P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
     \]
     Substituting the assumed probabilities:
     \[
     P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
     \]

6. **Posterior Probability \(P(A|B)\)**:
   - Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:
     \[
     P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
     \]

Therefore,
