To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to consider the following pieces of information:

1. The number of computer science professors (C) in the sample: 25
2. The number of humanities professors (H) in the sample: 75
3. The total number of professors: 25 (C) + 75 (H) = 100
4. The description provided for Jason suggests traits that might be more commonly associated with a computer science professor.

We apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is from computer science. 
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing the given description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing the given description for a computer science professor.

Given the description:

1. \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
2. \( P(A') = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (A' denotes the event of being a humanities professor)
3. The likelihood \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor, which we assume is higher due to the relevant traits like coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
4. \( P(B|A') \) is the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor, which is likely lower due to the less relevant traits.

Since we need these probabilities, but they are not directly given, we assign subjective probabilities to proceed with the calculation. Letâ€™s assume:

- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (since the description aligns very well with common traits of a computer science professor)
- \( P(B|A') \approx 0.1 \) (since the description does not align well with common traits of humanities professors)

Now, calculating the total probability \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

So the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

\[ \boxed{{"probability": "0.75"}} \]
