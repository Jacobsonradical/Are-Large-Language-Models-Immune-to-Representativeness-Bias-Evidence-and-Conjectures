To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event "Jason is a computer science professor".
- \( B \) is the event "the description matches Jason".

First, let’s define the given numbers:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor. P(A) = 25/100 = 0.25.
- The probability that a randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor. (Let's call this event H) P(H) = 75/100 = 0.75.

We need to determine:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that Jason's description fits a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|H) \), the probability that Jason's description fits a humanities professor.

Given that Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more typical traits of computer science professors, we will reasonably assume that \( P(B|A) \) is higher than \( P(B|H) \). However, for simplicity and without precise measures, we’ll qualitatively reason as follows:

Let's assign:
- \( P(B|A) \approx 0.9 \) (since Jason's traits strongly indicate a computer science background)
- \( P(B|H) \approx 0.1 \) (since Jason's traits weakly indicate a humanities background)

Now we compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that the description fits Jason disregarding his field:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.75.
