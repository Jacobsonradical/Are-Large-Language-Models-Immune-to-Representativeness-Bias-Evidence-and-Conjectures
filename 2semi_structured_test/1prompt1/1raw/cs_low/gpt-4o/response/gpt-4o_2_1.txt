To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that Jason is a computer science professor) based on new evidence (the description of Jason's interests and traits).

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that a professor is from computer science. There are 25 computer science professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
  \[
  P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
  \]

- \( P(Hum) \): The prior probability that a professor is from the humanities. There are 75 humanities professors out of a total of 100 professors, so:
  \[
  P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
  \]

Now, we need to consider the evidence \( E \) (the description of Jason) and use the likelihoods:

- \( P(E|CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(E|Hum) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

Based on the description provided, it seems more likely that Jason's interests and traits align with those of a computer science professor. Hence, we can assume \( P(E|CS) \) is higher than \( P(E|Hum) \), but unless given specific values, we'll assume a simplified estimated likelihood for the sake of this problem. Let's assume:

- \( P(E|CS) = 0.9 \) (since his interests align strongly with computer science)
- \( P(E|Hum) = 0.1 \) (since his interests are less aligned with typical humanities professor)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can update our probabilities:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(E|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(E|Hum) \cdot P(Hum)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75}
\]

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075}
\]

\[
P(CS|E) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is \( 0.75 \).

\[
\text{{{"probability": "0.75"}}}
