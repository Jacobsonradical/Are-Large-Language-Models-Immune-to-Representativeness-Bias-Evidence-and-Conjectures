To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can compute it:

1. **Determine the base rate (prior probability):**
   - The number of computer science professors = 25
   - The number of humanities professors = 75
   - Total number of professors = 25 + 75 = 100
   - Prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from computer science \( P(CS) \) = 25/100 = 0.25
   - Prior probability that a randomly selected professor is from humanities \( P(H) \) = 75/100 = 0.75

2. **Evaluate the likelihood of the description given each category:**
   Since we do not have exact likelihoods (probability of Jason's description given he is a CS professor vs. a humanities professor), we have to reason based on the given description. The description of Jason fits quite well with the traits that might be expected of a computer science professor:
   - Enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles.
   - This fits more strongly with a computer science background.

   If we denote:
   - \( P(D | CS) \) = Probability of this description given CS = let's assume this to be high, say 0.9 (since the traits strongly align with a computer science professor).
   - \( P(D | H) \) = Probability of this description given Humanities = let's assume this to be significantly lower, say 0.2 (the traits do not align well with typical humanities professors).

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:**
   
   Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]

   Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description:
   
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]
   
   Plugging in the numbers:
   
   \[
   P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
   \]
   
   \[
   P(D) = 0.225 + 0.15 = 0.375
   \]
   
   Now, compute the posterior probability:
   
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.375} = \frac{0.225}{0.375} = 0.6
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
\[
\text{{"probability"}}: "0.6"
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.6"}
```
