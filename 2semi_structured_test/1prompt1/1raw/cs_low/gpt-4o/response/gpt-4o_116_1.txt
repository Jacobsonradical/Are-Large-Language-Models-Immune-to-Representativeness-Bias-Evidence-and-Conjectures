To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \) be the descriptive profile given for Jason.

We are interested in \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Similarly, we have:

\[ P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Since Jason must be either a computer science professor or a humanities professor, we have:

\[ P(C|D) + P(H|D) = 1 \]

Firstly, we need to determine the prior probabilities, \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):

\[ P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \), which are essentially the likelihoods of Jason's description given his academic field. Given the provided description, Jason seems to fit characteristics more common among computer science professors, especially noting his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles:

Let's make a reasonable assumption that:

\[ P(D|C) \] is significantly higher than \( P(D|H) \).

For the sake of the calculation, if we assume:

\[ P(D|C) = 0.8 \] (Assuming a high likelihood that such a description fits a computer science professor)
\[ P(D|H) = 0.2 \] (Assuming a lower likelihood that such a description fits a humanities professor)

Now calculate the total probability of the description, \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

\[ P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]

\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]

\[ P(D) = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, given his description, is approximately \( 0.571 \).

Thus, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.571"}
