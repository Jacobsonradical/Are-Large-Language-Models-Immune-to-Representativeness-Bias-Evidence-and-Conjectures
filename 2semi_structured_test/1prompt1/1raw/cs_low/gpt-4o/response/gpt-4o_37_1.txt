To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here’s a step-by-step outline of how we can approach this:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{CS}) \), the initial (prior) probability that a professor is from computer science = \(\frac{25}{100}\).
   - \( P(\text{Humanities}) \), the initial (prior) probability that a professor is from humanities = \(\frac{75}{100}\).

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Let \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a computer science professor.
   - Let \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \) be the probability of Jason’s description given that he is a humanities professor.

Since Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, characteristics that are more common among computer science professors, we assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \) is higher than \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \).

Let's assign plausible values for these probabilities based on the description:
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) = 0.1 \)

3. **Normalization Constant** (Total Probability of the Description):
   - \( P(\text{Description}) \) is calculated by considering both scenarios (CS and Humanities):
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities})
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Description}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability** (Bayes' Theorem):
   - The probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description:
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})}
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} = \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately 0.727.

Hence, the answer is:
```json
{"probability": "0.727"}
```
