To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors (CS professors) in the sample, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- There are 25 CS professors and 75 humanities professors.
- The description could match either group, but we need to compute the posterior probability that Jason is a CS professor given his description.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(\text{CS}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{H}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Now, to proceed with Bayes' theorem, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \): The probability of the description given he is a CS professor.
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \): The probability of the description given he is a humanities professor.

To be honest, these exact probabilities are not given directly in the problem, so we can only reasonably assume that descriptions like Jason's (who enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) are significantly more likely for a CS professor than for a humanities professor.

For simplicity and based on typical assumptions about the fields:
- Let's assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) = 0.9 \)
- And assume \( P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) is computed as:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS}) \cdot P(\text{CS}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) \]
\[ = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{CS}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description is:
\[ \{ "probability": "0.75" \} \]
