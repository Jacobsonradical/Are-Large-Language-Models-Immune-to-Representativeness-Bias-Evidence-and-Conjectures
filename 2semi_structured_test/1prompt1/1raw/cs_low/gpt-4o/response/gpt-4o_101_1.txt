To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of getting a description like Jason's.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors is 100.

First, we need the prior probabilities \( P(A) \) and \( P(B) \):

\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

\[ P(A^c) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we consider the likelihood of receiving the description \( B \). Jason's interests and traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging) suggest that he is more likely a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Thus, we make an educated assumption:

\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \] (assuming high correlation with common CS traits)
\[ P(B|A^c) \approx 0.2 \] (assuming low correlation with common humanities traits)

Finally, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Then, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
