Let's use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description.

Let:
- \( C \) represent the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) represent the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We want to compute \( P(C|D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description (D).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, compute \( P(C) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor):

\[
P(C) = \frac{\text{number of computer science professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
\]

Next, compute \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor):

\[
P(H) = \frac{\text{number of humanities professors}}{\text{total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
\]

Now, let's focus on \( P(D|C) \) and \( P(D|H) \):
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|H) \) is the probability that Jason's description matches a humanities professor.

The description mentions certain traits and interests (enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) that are more typical of a computer science professor. Thus, it is reasonable to assume \( P(D|C) \) is relatively high compared to \( P(D|H) \), which should be low given the interests listed.

Let's denote the ratios:
- Assume \( P(D|C) \approx 0.9 \) (high because the description fits a computer science profile well).
- Assume \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (low because the description does not fit a typical humanities profile well).

Finally, compute \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description:

\[
P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3
\]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75
\]

Based on this computation, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
