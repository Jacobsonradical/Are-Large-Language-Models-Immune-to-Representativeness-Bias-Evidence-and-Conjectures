To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given his description, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

Since the description seems to fit a computer science professor more than a humanities professor (due to interests like coding and solving mathematical puzzles), let's assume the probability of the description being that of a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)) is quite high, say 0.8.

Conversely, the probability of the description fitting a humanities professor (\( P(B|A^c) \)) might be lower. Let's assume it is about 0.2.

Now we need to find \( P(B) \), which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.35 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.571.
