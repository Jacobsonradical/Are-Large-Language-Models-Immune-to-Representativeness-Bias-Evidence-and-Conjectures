To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the description, we can utilize Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Here’s the relevant information:

- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.

Given these numbers, the prior probabilities are:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(Hum) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to consider the likelihoods based on Jason's description. Since the description seems to fit a profile more typical of a computer science professor (coding, solving mathematical puzzles, does not enjoy drawing or writing), we can make educated guesses about these probabilities. Without precise likelihoods from the study, we might assume that:

- The likelihood of a computer science professor (CS) having this description, \( P(Desc | CS) \), is relatively high.
- The likelihood of a humanities professor (Hum) having this description, \( P(Desc | Hum) \), is relatively low.

For simplicity, let’s assign reasonable values to these likelihoods, reflecting the description’s strong correlation with computer science:

\[ P(Desc | CS) = 0.90 \]
\[ P(Desc | Hum) = 0.10 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(CS | Desc) \):

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(Desc)} \]

Where \( P(Desc) \) is the total probability of the description occurring, calculated as:

\[ P(Desc) = P(Desc | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(Desc | Hum) \cdot P(Hum) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(Desc) = (0.90 \cdot 0.25) + (0.10 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(Desc) = 0.30 \]

Now calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.90 \cdot 0.25}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.30} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
