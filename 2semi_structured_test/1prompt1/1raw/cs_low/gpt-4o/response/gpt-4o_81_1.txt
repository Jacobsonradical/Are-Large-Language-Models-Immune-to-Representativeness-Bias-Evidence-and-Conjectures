To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors based on the given description, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - Probability (prior) that any randomly chosen professor is a computer science professor: \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - Probability that any randomly chosen professor is a humanities professor: \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

2. **Likelihood**:
   - Probability that a computer science professor would fit Jason's description: \( P(D|CS) \)
   - Probability that a humanities professor would fit Jason's description: \( P(D|H) \)

Since we don't have specific likelihood values, we need to make some assumptions about the likelihood based on Jason's interests and traits, which seem more typical of a computer science professor (coding, mathematical puzzles) than a humanities professor. Let's assume:

   - \( P(D|CS) \) is high due to his interests aligning with typical computer science professors.
   - \( P(D|H) \) is low due to his interests not aligning as well with typical humanities professors.

For simplicity, let's assume:
   - \( P(D|CS) = 0.9 \) (high likelihood for computer science)
   - \( P(D|H) = 0.1 \) (low likelihood for humanities)

3. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Bayes' Theorem: \( P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \)
   - Where \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description across both groups.

   \( P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \)
   \( P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \)
   \( P(D) = (0.225) + (0.075) \)
   \( P(D) = 0.3 \)

   Now, calculate \( P(CS|D) \):
   \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \)
   \( P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \)
   \( P(CS|D) = 0.75 \)

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:
