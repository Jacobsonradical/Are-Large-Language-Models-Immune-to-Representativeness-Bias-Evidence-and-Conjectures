To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events first:

- \( CS \) : Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) : Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(CS | D) \), where \( D \) is the description of Jason.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Let’s break this down:

1. \( P(CS) \): The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor. This is the proportion of computer science professors among the total sample.
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor. This is the proportion of humanities professors among the total sample.
\[ P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. \( P(D | CS) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor. Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, etc., which are more typical characteristics of a computer science professor. We can assume that this probability is 1 (or very close to it, e.g., 0.99).

4. \( P(D | H) \): The probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor. Such characteristics are less typical for a humanities professor. We can assume this probability is much lower, say 0.01.

Finally, we need to find \( P(D) \), the total probability of the description \( D \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.99 \cdot 0.25) + (0.01 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2475 + 0.0075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.255 \]

Now, using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.25}{0.255} \]
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{0.2475}{0.255} \]
\[ P(CS | D) \approx 0.97 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.97, or 97%.
