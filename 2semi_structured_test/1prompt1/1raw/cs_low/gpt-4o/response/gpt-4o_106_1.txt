To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

The relevant probabilities needed are:
- The prior probability of selecting a computer science professor, \( P(CS) \)
- The prior probability of selecting a humanities professor, \( P(H) \)
- The probability of the description given a computer science professor, \( P(Desc | CS) \)
- The probability of the description given a humanities professor, \( P(Desc | H) \)

First, let's establish the priors:
- There are 25 computer science professors, so \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- There are 75 humanities professors, so \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | H) \). The description includes several traits that might be considered more typical of a computer science professor:
- Enjoys coding
- Solving mathematical puzzles
- Ambitious

These traits heavily suggest a computer science background. However, because exact probabilities for \( P(Desc | CS) \) and \( P(Desc | H) \) are not provided, we must make reasonable approximations. 

For simplicity, let's assume:
- \( P(Desc | CS) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(Desc | H) = 0.1 \)

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS)}{P(Desc | CS) \times P(CS) + P(Desc | H) \times P(H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(CS | Desc) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

\[ \{\text{"probability"}: "0.75"\} \]
