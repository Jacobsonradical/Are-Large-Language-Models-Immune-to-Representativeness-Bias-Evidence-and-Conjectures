To determine the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probabilities of two events, taking into account prior knowledge about the likelihood of those events.

Given:
- Total number of professors (P) = 100
- Number of computer science professors (C) = 25
- Number of humanities professors (H) = 75

We need to find \( P(C | D) \) â€” the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:

- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of selecting a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D | H) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

We know:

- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

For \( P(D) \), we need to consider both cases (computer science and humanities):

\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

From the description, Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and does not enjoy drawing or writing. These traits are more indicative of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Hence, we can hypothesize that:

- \( P(D | C) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor) will be high.
- \( P(D | H) \) (probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor) will be low.

To assign these probabilities, let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \)

Now compute \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} = \frac{0.225}{0.3} = 0.75 \]

Hence, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:

{"probability": "0.75"}
