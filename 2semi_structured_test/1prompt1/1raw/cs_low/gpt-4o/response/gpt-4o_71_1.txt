To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. The general formulation of Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) is the event of the description provided.

We need to calculate several components:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(A) \)** (the probability of being a computer science professor):
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

2. **Prior Probability \( P(A^c) \)** (the probability of being a humanities professor):
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

3. **Likelihood \( P(B|A) \)** (the probability of the description given he is a computer science professor):
Given Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and has other traits that align more closely with the stereotypical profile of a computer science professor, we can consider this likelihood to be significant. For practical purposes, let's assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.9 \]

4. **Likelihood \( P(B|A^c) \)** (the probability of the description given he is a humanities professor):
Jason's interests in coding and mathematical puzzles are less aligned with the stereotypical profile of a humanities professor. Hence, we assume this likelihood to be lower. Let's assume:
\[ P(B|A^c) = 0.1 \]

5. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.3 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.75 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75, or:
