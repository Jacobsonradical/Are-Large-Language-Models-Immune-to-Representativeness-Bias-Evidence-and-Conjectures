To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Here's the breakdown of the given info:

- Number of computer science professors: 25.
- Number of humanities professors: 75.
- Total number of professors: 100.

Let:
- \( A_1 \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( A_2 \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( B \) be the event of getting Jason's description.

We want \( P(A_1|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A_1) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(A_2) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(B|A_1) \) and \( P(B|A_2) \), the probabilities of Jason's description given he is a computer science or humanities professor, respectively.

Given the description of Jason (enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging), it is more likely he fits the profile of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. 

We can make an educated assumption here:
Let's assume \( P(B|A_1) = 0.8 \) (high likelihood given the typical interests and traits of someone in computer science) and \( P(B|A_2) = 0.2 \) (lower likelihood given different typical interests in the humanities).

Now, calculating \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A_1|B) \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors:

{"probability": "0.571"}
