To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be stated as: 

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \times P(CS)}{P(D|CS) \times P(CS) + P(D|HU) \times P(HU)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given his description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is in computer science.
- \( P(D|HU) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( P(HU) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen professor from the sample is in humanities.

Given:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors in the sample.

Therefore:
\[ P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]
\[ P(HU) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Next, we need to estimate \( P(D|CS) \) and \( P(D|HU) \). Because Jason's description aligns more closely with common computer science traits (coding, mathematical puzzles, etc.), we can reasonably assume that Jason's traits are more representative of the computer science sample than the humanities sample. 

To simplify, let's assume that given Jason's description, the probability that he is a computer science professor is much higher, and the probability that he is a humanities professor is relatively low. We will make these reasonable estimations:
\[ P(D|CS) = 0.9 \]
\[ P(D|HU) = 0.1 \]

Now plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.25}{0.9 \times 0.25 + 0.1 \times 0.75} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.225 + 0.075} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]

\[ P(CS|D) = 0.75 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is 0.75.

Answer: {"probability": "0.75"}
