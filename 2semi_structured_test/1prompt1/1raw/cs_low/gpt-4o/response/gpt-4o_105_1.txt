To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:

- \( C \): The event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): The event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): The description of Jason.

Given:
- The number of computer science professors (\(C\)) = 25.
- The number of humanities professors (\(H\)) = 75.

From the total, we can compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

However, calculating \( P(D) \) may be complex, so instead, we use the fact that we only need to compare the likelihoods of Jason being from each group:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H)} \]

Intuitively, Jason's enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles aligns more with the typical interests of a computer science professor than a humanities professor. Let's make reasonable subjective assumptions about these probabilities:

We'll assign:
- \( P(D|C) \approx 0.7 \) (highly likely that a computer science professor fits the description),
- \( P(D|H) \approx 0.1 \) (less likely that a humanities professor fits the description).

Finally, we substitute these values in:

\[
P(C|D) = \frac{0.7 \cdot 0.25}{0.7 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75} 
       = \frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.075} 
       = \frac{0.175}{0.25} 
       = 0.7
\]

Thus, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.7.
