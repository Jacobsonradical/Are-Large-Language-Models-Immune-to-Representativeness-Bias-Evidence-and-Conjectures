To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( CS \): the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \): the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( D \): the description given (i.e., Jason's personality traits and interests).

We need to calculate \( P(CS | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor, which is \( \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \).
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description.

But we can rewrite \( P(D) \) as:
\[ P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given that:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor, which is \( \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We now need estimates for \( P(D | CS) \) and \( P(D | H) \), the probabilities of the description given the professor's field. Without detailed information about the distributions, we must rely on the given description to make reasonable assessments.

Jason enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging, strongly suggesting traits commonly associated with computer science professors. Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(D | CS) \approx 1 \) (or very close to 1)
- \( P(D | H) \approx 0 \) (or very close to 0)

Now we calculate:
\[ P(D) \approx 1 \cdot 0.25 + 0 \cdot 0.75 = 0.25 \]

Then,
\[ P(CS | D) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.25}{0.25} = 1 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is nearly 1.

Here is the answer in the required format:
