To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem relates the probability of one event given another event by considering their individual probabilities and the probability of them coinciding.

Here's a breakdown process to figure this out:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - The probability of randomly selecting a computer science professor (\(P(CS)\)): \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)
   - The probability of randomly selecting a humanities professor (\(P(H)\)): \(\frac{75}{100} = 0.75\)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a computer science professor (\(P(D | CS)\))
   - The likelihood of Jason's description given he is a humanities professor (\(P(D | H)\))

To move any further, we would need an assessment of how likely it is for someone in each group to fit Jason's description. Since the description fits traits typical of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) more than a humanities professor based on general knowledge, we may assume:

- \(P(D | CS)\) is generally higher than \(P(D | H)\).

To work with actual numbers, let's hypothetically assume:
- \(P(D | CS) = 0.8\), meaning that 80% of computer science professors might fit the description.
- \(P(D | H) = 0.1\), meaning that 10% of humanities professors might fit the description.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)}
   \]
   Where \(P(D)\) is the total probability of the description \(D\) occurring:
   \[
   P(D) = P(D | CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H)
   \]

Let's plug in the values:
   \[
   P(D) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) = 0.2 + 0.075 = 0.275
   \]

Now compute \(P(CS | D)\):
   \[
   P(CS | D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.275} \approx \frac{0.2}{0.275} \approx 0.727
   \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately 0.727.

Therefore, the answer is:

{"probability": "0.727"}
