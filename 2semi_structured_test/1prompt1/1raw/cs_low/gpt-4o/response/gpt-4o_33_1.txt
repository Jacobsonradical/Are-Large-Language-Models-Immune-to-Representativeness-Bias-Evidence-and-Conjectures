To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we can apply Bayes’ Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new information.

The given information distinguishes two groups:
1. Computer Science Professors (CS): 25
2. Humanities Professors (H): 75

We need to find the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the provided description. Bayes’ Theorem formula is:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(CS|D) \) is the probability that Jason is a CS professor given the description.
- \( P(D|CS) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a CS professor.
- \( P(CS) \) is the prior probability of selecting a CS professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description.

We can assume that the features like coding, solving mathematical puzzles, and jogging are more consistent with the profile of a computer science professor. Let’s assign some subjective probabilities for demonstration:

1. Assume \( P(D|CS) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a CS professor, is high, e.g., 0.8.
2. Assume \( P(D|H) \), the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor, is lower, e.g., 0.2.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(CS) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

The total probability of the description (\( P(D) \)) can be found by the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Now apply Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(CS|D) = \frac{2}{3.5} \approx 0.57 \]

Thus, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.57.
