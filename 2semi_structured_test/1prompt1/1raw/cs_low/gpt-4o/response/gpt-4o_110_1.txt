To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We're given:
- \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) (prior probability of being a computer science professor)
- \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \) (prior probability of being a humanities professor)

Additionally, we need to estimate:
- \( P(d|C) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(d|H) \): the probability of the description given that Jason is a humanities professor.

The description provided suggests attributes typically associated with computer science more than the humanities (e.g., enjoys coding, solving mathematical puzzles). Thus, one could reasonably infer that \( P(d|C) \) might be significantly higher than \( P(d|H) \).

Let's assume:
- \( P(d|C) = 0.8 \) (high probability of the description for a computer science professor)
- \( P(d|H) = 0.2 \) (lower probability of the description for a humanities professor)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|d) = \frac{P(d|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(d)} \]

Where:
\[ P(d) = P(d|C) \cdot P(C) + P(d|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(d) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(d) = 0.2 + 0.15 \]
\[ P(d) = 0.35 \]

Now, use this to find \( P(C|d) \):
\[ P(C|d) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|d) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(C|d) = \frac{4}{7} \]
\[ P(C|d) \approx 0.571 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
