To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's establish the prior probabilities:
- \( P(\text{CS Prof}) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(\text{Humanities Prof}) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, we need to estimate the likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \) and given that he is a humanities professor \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Prof}) \).

Given Jason's interests and characteristics:
- Coding and solving mathematical puzzles are typically more aligned with computer science.
- Although jogging is more neutral, the lack of interest in drawing or writing tilts more towards a computer science professor.

Based on this description, we can reasonably estimate:

- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \) is notably higher than \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Prof}) \).

Letâ€™s assume:
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Prof}) = 0.1 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof})}{P(\text{Description})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Description}) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Description}) = P(\text{Description}|\text{CS Prof}) \cdot P(\text{CS Prof}) + P(\text{Description}|\text{Humanities Prof}) \cdot P(\text{Humanities Prof}) \]

\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(\text{Description}) = 0.3 \]

Then:
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(\text{CS Prof}|\text{Description}) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is:

```
{"probability": "0.75"}
