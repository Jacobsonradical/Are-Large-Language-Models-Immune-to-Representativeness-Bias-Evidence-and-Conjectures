To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We need to determine the probability \( P(C \mid D) \), where \(C\) refers to Jason being a computer science professor and \(D\) refers to the given description.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

1. **\( P(C) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
   \[
   P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

2. **\( P(H) \)**: The prior probability that Jason is a humanities professor.
   \[
   P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75
   \]

3. **\( P(D \mid C) \)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a computer science professor. This value needs to be estimated based on how likely it is that a computer science professor would fit this description.

4. **\( P(D \mid H) \)**: The likelihood of Jason's description given that he is a humanities professor. Similarly, this value needs to be estimated based on how likely it is that a humanities professor would fit the given description.

Given the specifics of the description:
- Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, which are more likely associated with computer science professors.
- Jason does not enjoy drawing or writing, which might be less typical for humanities professors.

These clues strongly suggest that Jason's profile fits better with a computer science professor. Therefore, we can make an educated assumption that:

\[ P(D \mid C) \gg P(D \mid H) \]

Without concrete numbers for \( P(D \mid C) \) and \( P(D \mid H) \), a reasonable assumption might be to give these likelihoods values that reflect the stronger association of Jason's interests with computer science:
- Let's assume \( P(D \mid C) = 0.8 \)
- And assume \( P(D \mid H) = 0.2 \)

Now we compute \( P(D) \) which is the total probability of the description across both groups:
\[
P(D) = P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C) + P(D \mid H) \cdot P(H)
= (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75)
= 0.2 + 0.15
= 0.35
\]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(C \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \approx 0.571
\]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is approximately:
