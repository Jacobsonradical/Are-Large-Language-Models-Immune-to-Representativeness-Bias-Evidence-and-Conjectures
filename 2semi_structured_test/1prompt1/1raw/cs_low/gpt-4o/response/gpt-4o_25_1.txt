To compute the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here, we are interested in the probability of Jason being a computer science professor given his described personality traits.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of being a computer science professor given the description \( B \).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the person is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The person is a computer science professor.
- \( B \): The provided description fits the person.

From the sample:
- There are 25 computer science professors.
- There are 75 humanities professors.
- Total number of professors is 100.

Prior probability \( P(A) \):
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

Prior probability of being a humanities professor \( P(A') \):
\[ P(A') = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Assume that \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the description given that the person is a computer science professor, and \( P(B|A') \) is the likelihood given that the person is a humanities professor. Given Jason's traits (interest in coding, mathematical puzzles, jogging, and not enjoying drawing or writing), it seems more consistent with computer science.

Even without exact numbers for the description's likelihoods, it's reasonable to assume:
\[ P(B|A) > P(B|A') \]

For simplicity, let's assume \( P(B|A) \approx 0.8 \) and \( P(B|A') \approx 0.2 \).

Overall probability of the description \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} = \frac{0.2}{0.35} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor is approximately 0.571.
