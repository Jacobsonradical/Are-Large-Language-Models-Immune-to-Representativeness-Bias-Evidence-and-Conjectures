To find the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

First, let's denote:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- \( T \) as the description matching Jason's profile.

We are looking for \( P(C|T) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{P(T|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(T)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T|C) \) is the probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(T) \) is the total probability of the description.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) and \( P(H) \):
- \( P(C) = \frac{\text{Number of computer science professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
- \( P(H) = \frac{\text{Number of humanities professors}}{\text{Total number of professors}} = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \)

Next, consider the likelihoods \( P(T|C) \) and \( P(T|H) \):
Given the description, it strongly aligns with typical traits of a computer science professor (e.g., enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles) and less so with a humanities professor. Therefore, we can assume:
- \( P(T|C) \) is high.
- \( P(T|H) \) is low.

For estimation purposes, let's assume:
- \( P(T|C) = 0.9 \)
- \( P(T|H) = 0.1 \)

Now, to find \( P(T) \):
\[ P(T) = P(T|C) \cdot P(C) + P(T|H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(T) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(T) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(T) = 0.3 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{P(T|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(T)} \]
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|T) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|T) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors given the description is \( 0.75 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
