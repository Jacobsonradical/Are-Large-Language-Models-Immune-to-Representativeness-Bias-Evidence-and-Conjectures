To estimate the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We'll define:
- \( C \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( H \) as the event that Jason is a humanities professor.

We need to find \( P(C | D) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{P(D | C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(D | C) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of picking a computer science professor, which is \(\frac{25}{100} = 0.25\).
- \( P(D) \) is the total probability of the description, which we expand using the law of total probability:
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]

Given we have little information to directly estimate \( P(D | C) \) and \( P(D | H) \), we qualitatively assess the description's fit.

Jason enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles, activities more aligned with computer science professors. Thus:
- \( P(D | C) \) is likely high.
- \( P(D | H) \) is likely low.

Let's assume:
- \( P(D | C) = 0.9 \) (high because the description fits a computer science profile),
- \( P(D | H) = 0.1 \) (low because the description doesn't fit as well with humanities).

Now, calculating \( P(D) \):
\[ P(D) = P(D | C) \cdot P(C) + P(D | H) \cdot P(H) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.9 \cdot 0.25 + 0.1 \cdot 0.75 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 = 0.3 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.9 \cdot 0.25}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C | D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors is:
