To compute the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description across all professors.

### Step-by-step Calculation
1. **Find \( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \):**
   - There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
   - \( P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.75 \)

2. **Estimate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):**
   - Given the description, we estimate the probability that Jason fits the profile of a computer science professor (\( P(B|A) \)) as higher since he enjoys coding and solving mathematical puzzles which are more associated with computer science.
   - Although these are subjective estimates, letâ€™s hypothesize:
     - \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
     - \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \), since humanities professors are less likely to enjoy coding and mathematical puzzles.

3. **Compute \( P(B) \):**
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.25) + (0.2 \cdot 0.75) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \approx 0.5714 \]

Therefore, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
