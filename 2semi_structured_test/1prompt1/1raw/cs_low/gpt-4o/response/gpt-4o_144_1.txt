To solve this, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability estimate of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the necessary components:
- Let \( C \) be the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- Let \( H \) be the event that Jason is a humanities professor.
- Let \( D \) be the given description of Jason.

We need to find the probability \( P(C|D) \), which is the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description \( D \). According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{P(D|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \( P(C) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(D|C) \) is the probability of the description \( D \) given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(D) \) is the probability of the description \( D \).

Firstly, we know the following from the problem:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.
- Therefore, \( P(C) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \) and \( P(H) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \).

We assume that the description of Jason is more likely for a computer science professor due to his enjoyment of coding and solving mathematical puzzles. For the sake of this problem, let's assume:
- \( P(D|C) \), the likelihood of this description given that Jason is a computer science professor, is relatively high. We'll use a hypothetical value of 0.9.
- \( P(D|H) \), the likelihood of this description given that Jason is a humanities professor, is relatively low. We'll use a hypothetical value of 0.1.

Using the law of total probability for \( P(D) \):

\[ P(D) = P(D|C) \cdot P(C) + P(D|H) \cdot P(H) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P(D) = (0.9 \cdot 0.25) + (0.1 \cdot 0.75) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.225 + 0.075 \]
\[ P(D) = 0.3 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(C|D) = \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.25)}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = \frac{0.225}{0.3} \]
\[ P(C|D) = 0.75 \]

So, the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description is 0.75.
