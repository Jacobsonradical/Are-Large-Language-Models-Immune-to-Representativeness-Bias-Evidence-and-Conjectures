To determine the probability that Jason is a computer science professor from the sample, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( B \) as the description given of Jason.

We need to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that Jason is a computer science professor given the description.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of Jason being a computer science professor.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the description given that Jason is a computer science professor.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the description.

However, since the given data only allows us to consider the relative probabilities and not conditional distributions, we'll use a simplified approach relying on the proportions given.

We know:
- There are 25 computer science professors and 75 humanities professors.

Therefore, the probability \( P(A) \) that Jason is a computer science professor without any description is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 \]

The probability \( P(A^c) \) that Jason is a humanities professor is:
\[ P(A^c) = \frac{75}{100} = 0.75 \]

Given the description, Jason appears to have traits that are arguably more aligned with computer science (e.g., enjoying coding, solving mathematical puzzles), though humanities professors can also enjoy similar activities. Let's assume there's higher likelihood that someone with these traits is from computer science than from humanities. Without advanced training data, let's hypothesize:

- Probability of the description given Jason is a computer science professor \( P(B|A) \) is significantly higher than the probability of the description given Jason is a humanities professor \( P(B|A^c) \).

For simplification:
Assume \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (this is a high probability recognizing a good fit).
Assume \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (this is lower considering the fit is not as strong).

Using these assumptions, we can plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.25}{0.8 \cdot 0.25 + 0.2 \cdot 0.75} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.2 + 0.15} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2}{0.35} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{2}{3.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5714 \]

So, the probability that Jason is one of the computer science professors in the sample is approximately:
\[ \{"probability": "0.5714"\} \]
