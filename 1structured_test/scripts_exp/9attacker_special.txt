A person was attacked from behind at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height.
In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 80% of the people are

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller?
