Consider two very large decks of cards, denoted A and B. In deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
In deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.

One of the decks has been selected by chance, and 4 cards have been drawn at random from it, of which 3 are marked X
and 1 are marked O.

What are the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared
to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O?
