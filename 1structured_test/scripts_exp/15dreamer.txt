Studies of dreaming have shown that 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally,
whereas 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Accordingly, people are classified by dream investigators
as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers". The study has also found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity
regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Brett is a Nondreamer.

What do you think are the probabilities that his wife is also a Nondreamer?
