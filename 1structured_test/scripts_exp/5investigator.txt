There are two investigators selected a paperback to study some properties of language.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length in every page of the book. Investigator 2 took the first line in each
page and computed the line's average word-length.

The average word-length in the entire book is 4. However, not every line or page has exactly that average. Some may
have a higher average word-length, some lower.

Investigator 1 counted the number of pages that had an average word-length of 6 or more and Investigator 2 counted
the number of lines that had an average word-length of 6 or more.

Which investigator do you think recorded a larger number of such units? Or do you think they are about the same
(within 5% of each other)?

Please answer 1 if you think investigator 1 recorded more, 2 if you think investigator 2 recorded more, and 3
if you think they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
