Studies of dreaming have shown that 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally,
whereas 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Accordingly, people are classified by dream investigators
as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers". With respect to dreaming, the classification is found to be independent in successive
generations.

Brett is a Nondreamer.
