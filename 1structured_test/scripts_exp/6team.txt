A medical survey is being held to study some factors pertaining to a certain disease. Two teams are collecting data
from a population. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height
is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

In a period of 365 days, each day Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population. During the survey, the team
ranks the three men with respect to their height. At the end of the period, the team counts the total number of days
on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

In the same period, each day Team 2 randomly surveys only one man from the population. At the end of the period, the
team simply counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Which team do you think counted more such days? Or do you think they are about the same (within 5% of each other)?

Please answer 1 if you think team 1 recorded more, 2 if you think team 2 recorded more, and 3 if you think they are
about the same (within 5% of each other).

Please answer the question in the follow format:
{team: your answer}
