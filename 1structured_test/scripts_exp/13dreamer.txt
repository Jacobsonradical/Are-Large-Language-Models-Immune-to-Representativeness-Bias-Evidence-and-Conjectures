Studies of dreaming have shown that 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally,
whereas 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Accordingly, people are classified by dream investigators
as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers". With respect to dreaming, mating is completely random.

Brett is a Nondreamer.

What do you think are the probabilities that his wife is also a Nondreamer?
