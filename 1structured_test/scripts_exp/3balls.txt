One each round of a game, 6 distinguishable balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, C.
Consider the following two cases of how the balls are distributed:

case 1 --- A:2, B:2, C:2
case 2 --- A:2, B:3, C:1


In many rounds of the game, will there be more results of case 1 or case 2? Please feel free to compute and reason, and
answer the question in the following format:
{case: your answer, 1 or 2}
