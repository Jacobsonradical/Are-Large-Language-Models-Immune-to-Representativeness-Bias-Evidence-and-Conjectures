A certain town is served by two hospitals. In hospital 1 about 45 babies are born each day, and in hospital 2 about 15
babies are born each day.

About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day. Sometimes it may be
higher than 50%, sometimes lower.

For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.


Which hospital do you think recorded more such days? Or do you think they are about the same (within 5% of each other)?

Please answer 1 if you think hospital 1 recorded more, 2 if you think hospital 2 recorded more, and 3 if you think they
are about the same (within 5% of each other).
