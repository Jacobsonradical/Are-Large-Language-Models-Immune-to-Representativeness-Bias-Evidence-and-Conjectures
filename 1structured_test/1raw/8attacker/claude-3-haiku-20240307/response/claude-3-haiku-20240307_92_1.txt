To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we can determine the following:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4545

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4545}
