To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an accuracy of 80% in correctly identifying height in similar conditions.
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in correctly identifying height)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35 (the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
