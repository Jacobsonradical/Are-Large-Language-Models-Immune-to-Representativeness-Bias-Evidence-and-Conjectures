To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
