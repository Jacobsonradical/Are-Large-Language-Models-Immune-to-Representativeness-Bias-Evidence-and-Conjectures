To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

1. Calculating P(B|A):
The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

2. Calculating P(A):
From the given information, we know that 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

3. Calculating P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

4. Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.286

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.286}
