To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4444}
