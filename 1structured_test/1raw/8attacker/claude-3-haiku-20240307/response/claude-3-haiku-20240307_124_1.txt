To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the given information, the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35 (using the law of total probability)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
