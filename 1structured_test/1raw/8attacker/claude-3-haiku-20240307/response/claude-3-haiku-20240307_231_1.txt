To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the desired probability as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was under 185 cm)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
