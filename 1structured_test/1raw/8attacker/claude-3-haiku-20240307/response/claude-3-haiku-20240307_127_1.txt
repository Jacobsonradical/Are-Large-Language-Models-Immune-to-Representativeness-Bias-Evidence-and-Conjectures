To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Calculations:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.29}
