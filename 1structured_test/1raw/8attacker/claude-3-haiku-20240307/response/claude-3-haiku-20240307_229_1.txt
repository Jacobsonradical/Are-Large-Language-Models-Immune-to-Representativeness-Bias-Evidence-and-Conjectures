To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- A witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.
- 85% of potential attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of potential attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
