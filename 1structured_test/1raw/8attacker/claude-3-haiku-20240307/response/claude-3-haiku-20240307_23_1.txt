To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.32 (the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 32% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
