To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- P(A|B) = 0.8, where A represents the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and B represents the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height.
- P(A) = 0.15, where A represents the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) = 0.8, where B represents the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height.
- P(B|not A) = 0.2, where B represents the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, and not A represents the attacker's height being less than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.70

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.70 or 70%.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.70}
