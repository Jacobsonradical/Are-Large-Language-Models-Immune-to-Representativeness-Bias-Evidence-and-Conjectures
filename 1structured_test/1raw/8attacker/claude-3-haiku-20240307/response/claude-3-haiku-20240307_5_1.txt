To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller in 38% of cases)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equation:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3157

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3157}
