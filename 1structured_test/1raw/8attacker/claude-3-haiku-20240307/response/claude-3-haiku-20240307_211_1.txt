To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness identified) = (P(witness identified | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm)) / P(witness identified)

Given information:
- P(witness identified | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

To find P(witness identified), we can use the law of total probability:
P(witness identified) = P(witness identified | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness identified | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm)
P(witness identified) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.38

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness identified) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158 or approximately 0.316

{probability: 0.316}
