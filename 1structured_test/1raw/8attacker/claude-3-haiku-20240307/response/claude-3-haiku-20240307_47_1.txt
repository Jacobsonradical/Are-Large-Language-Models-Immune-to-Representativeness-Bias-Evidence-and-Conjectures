To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the court assessed the witness's ability to correctly identify height in similar conditions, which is 80% accurate and 20% error.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

1. Calculate P(B|A):
P(B|A) = 0.80 (based on the given information)

2. Calculate P(A):
P(A) = 0.15 (based on the given information)

3. Calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.46

4. Calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.46 = 0.26

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.26}
