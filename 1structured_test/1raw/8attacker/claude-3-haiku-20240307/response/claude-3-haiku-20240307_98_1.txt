To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the information that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A (the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) given B (the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.4146

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4146}
