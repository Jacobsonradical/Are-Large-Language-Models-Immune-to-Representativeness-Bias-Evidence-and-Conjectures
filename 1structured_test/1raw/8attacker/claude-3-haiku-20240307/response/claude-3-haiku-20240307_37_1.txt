To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, for a sample of people where half are shorter than 185 cm and half are 185 cm or taller.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Calculations:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the problem statement)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
3. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.38

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
