To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.29 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified 80% of them; 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and the witness erred in 20% of those cases)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
