To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, and the prior probabilities of the attacker being shorter or taller than 185 cm.

Given information:
- Witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of cases.
- 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.37 (weighted average of correct and incorrect identifications)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.324}
