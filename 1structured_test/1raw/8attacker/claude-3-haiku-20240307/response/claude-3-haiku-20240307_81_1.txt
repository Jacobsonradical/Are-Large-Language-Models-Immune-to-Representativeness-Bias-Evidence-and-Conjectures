To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3158}
