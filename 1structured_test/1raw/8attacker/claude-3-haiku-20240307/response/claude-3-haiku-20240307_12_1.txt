To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.32

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
