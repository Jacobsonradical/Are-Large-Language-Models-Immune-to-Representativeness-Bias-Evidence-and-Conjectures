To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
