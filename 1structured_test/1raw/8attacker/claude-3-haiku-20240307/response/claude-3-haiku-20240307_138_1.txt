To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases when the sample was evenly split between those shorter and taller than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases when the sample was evenly split)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.293

{probability: 0.293}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.293 or approximately 29.3%.
