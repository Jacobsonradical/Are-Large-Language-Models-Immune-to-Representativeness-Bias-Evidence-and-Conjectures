To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following variables:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)

To find P(A|B), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.36

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.36 = 0.3333

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3333}
