To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.
- The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying heights 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.52 (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.52 = 0.23

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.23}
