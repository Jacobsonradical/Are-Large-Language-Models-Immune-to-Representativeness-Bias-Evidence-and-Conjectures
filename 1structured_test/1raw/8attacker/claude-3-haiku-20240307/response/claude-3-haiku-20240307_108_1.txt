To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4444}
