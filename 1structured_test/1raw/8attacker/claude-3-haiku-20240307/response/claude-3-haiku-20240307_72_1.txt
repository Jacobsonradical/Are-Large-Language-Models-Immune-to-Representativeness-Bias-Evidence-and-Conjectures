To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the given information)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from the given information)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (from the given information)
  - P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.44

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.44 = 0.2727

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2727}
