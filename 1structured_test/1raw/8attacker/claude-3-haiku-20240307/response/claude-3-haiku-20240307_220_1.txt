To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the given information)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
        = 0.48

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.48
       = 0.25

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.25}
