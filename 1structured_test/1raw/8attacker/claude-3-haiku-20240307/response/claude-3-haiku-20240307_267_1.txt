To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

We need to find P(A') first:
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
