To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 15%)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 85%)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706 or 47.06%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4706}
