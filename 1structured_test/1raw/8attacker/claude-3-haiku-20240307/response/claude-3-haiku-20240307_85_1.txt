To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
3. P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
4. P(A') = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
5. P(A|B) = ? (the probability we want to calculate)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
