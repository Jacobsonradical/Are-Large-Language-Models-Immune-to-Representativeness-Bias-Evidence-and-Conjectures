To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population of attackers 185 cm or taller is 15%)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the population of attackers shorter than 185 cm is 85%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.4146

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4146}
