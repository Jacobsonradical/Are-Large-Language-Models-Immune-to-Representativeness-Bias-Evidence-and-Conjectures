To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the information)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
3. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
