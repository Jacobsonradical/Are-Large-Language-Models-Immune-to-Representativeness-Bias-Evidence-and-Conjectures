To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.563

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.563 or 56.3%.
