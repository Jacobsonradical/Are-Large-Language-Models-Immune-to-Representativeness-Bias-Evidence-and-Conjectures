To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the problem statement)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem equation:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
