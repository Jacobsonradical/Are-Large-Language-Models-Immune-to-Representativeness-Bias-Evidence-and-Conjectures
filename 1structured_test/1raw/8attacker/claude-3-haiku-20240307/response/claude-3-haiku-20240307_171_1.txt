To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Calculations:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
