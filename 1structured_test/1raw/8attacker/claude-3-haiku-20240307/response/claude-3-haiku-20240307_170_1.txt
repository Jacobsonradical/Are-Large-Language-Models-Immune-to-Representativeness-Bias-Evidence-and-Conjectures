To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height given the witness's identification and the population distribution of attackers.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller 15% of the time)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 85% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
