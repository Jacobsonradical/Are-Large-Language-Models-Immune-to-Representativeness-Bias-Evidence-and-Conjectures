To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Substituting the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.32 (the witness correctly identifies the height 32% of the time)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

{probability: 0.375}
