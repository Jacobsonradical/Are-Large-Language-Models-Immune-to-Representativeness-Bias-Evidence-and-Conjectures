To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(A), the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Step 2: Calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

Step 3: Calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.47

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.47 = 0.255

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.255}
