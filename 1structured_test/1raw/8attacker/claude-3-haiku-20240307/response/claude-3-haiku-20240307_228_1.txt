To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population of attackers 185 cm or taller is 15%)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the population of attackers shorter than 185 cm is 85%)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4615}
