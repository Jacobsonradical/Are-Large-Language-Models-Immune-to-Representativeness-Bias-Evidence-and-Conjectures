To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5454

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5454}
