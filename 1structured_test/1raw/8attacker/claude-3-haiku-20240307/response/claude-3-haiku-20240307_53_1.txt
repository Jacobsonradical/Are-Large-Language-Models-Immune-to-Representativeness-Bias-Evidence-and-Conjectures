To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.53

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.53}
