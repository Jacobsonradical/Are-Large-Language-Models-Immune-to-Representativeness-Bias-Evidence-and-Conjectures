To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Calculations:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.35 (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller in 35% of the cases)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.429

{probability: 0.429}
