To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.4146

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4146}
