To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population of attackers 185 cm or taller is 15%)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the population of attackers shorter than 185 cm is 85%)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2857}
