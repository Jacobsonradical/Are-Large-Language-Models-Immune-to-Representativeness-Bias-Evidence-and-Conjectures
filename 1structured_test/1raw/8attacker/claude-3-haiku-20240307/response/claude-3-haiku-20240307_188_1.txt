To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.35 (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.343

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.343}
