To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was not 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
