To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4598

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4598}
