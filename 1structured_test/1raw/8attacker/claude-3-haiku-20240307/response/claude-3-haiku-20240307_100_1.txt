To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are under 185 cm)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
