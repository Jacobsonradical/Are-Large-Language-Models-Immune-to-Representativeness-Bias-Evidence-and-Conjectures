Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. We know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. However, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) 
= (P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Where:
P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into the formula:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) 
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38
= 0.3158

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3158}
