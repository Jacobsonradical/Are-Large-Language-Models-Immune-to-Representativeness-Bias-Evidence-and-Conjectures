To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)

Step 2: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
