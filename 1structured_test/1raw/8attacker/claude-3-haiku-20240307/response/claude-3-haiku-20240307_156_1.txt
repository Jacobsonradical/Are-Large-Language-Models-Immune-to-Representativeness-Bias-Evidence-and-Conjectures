To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.5454

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5454}
