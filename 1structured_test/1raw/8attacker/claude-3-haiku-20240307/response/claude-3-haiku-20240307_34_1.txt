To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness's ability to correctly identify height is 80% and errs in 20% of cases.
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, but 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
