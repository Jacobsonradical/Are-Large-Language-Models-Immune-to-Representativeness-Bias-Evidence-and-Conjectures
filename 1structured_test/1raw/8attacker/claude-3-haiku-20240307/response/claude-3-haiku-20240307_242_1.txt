To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller 38% of the time)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

{probability: 0.316}
