To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height and the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller 15% of the time)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 85% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.475

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.475}
