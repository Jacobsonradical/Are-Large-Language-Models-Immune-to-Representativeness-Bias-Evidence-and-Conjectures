To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was under 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are under 185 cm)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
