To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.74.
