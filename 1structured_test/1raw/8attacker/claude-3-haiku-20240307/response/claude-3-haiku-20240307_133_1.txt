To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, as the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) = 0.15, as 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|not A) = 0.2, as the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm.
- P(not A) = 0.85, as 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
