To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the sample is evenly split between those shorter and taller than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as such.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the overall probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (given in the problem statement)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.38

Substituting the values into the Bayes' Theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
