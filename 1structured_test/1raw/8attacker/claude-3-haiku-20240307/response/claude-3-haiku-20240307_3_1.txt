To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B = Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
