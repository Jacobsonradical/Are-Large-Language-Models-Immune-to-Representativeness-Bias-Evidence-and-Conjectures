To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from statement "a", 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from statement "b", the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (from statement "b", the witness erred 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444 or 44.44%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4444}
