To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the given information)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases)
- P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.32 (the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
