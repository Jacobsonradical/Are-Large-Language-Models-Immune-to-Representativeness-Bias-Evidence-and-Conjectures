To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was under 185 cm)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4615}
