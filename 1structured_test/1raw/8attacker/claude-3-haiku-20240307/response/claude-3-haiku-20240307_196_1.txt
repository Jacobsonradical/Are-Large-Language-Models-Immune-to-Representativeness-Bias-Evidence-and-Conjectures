To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
