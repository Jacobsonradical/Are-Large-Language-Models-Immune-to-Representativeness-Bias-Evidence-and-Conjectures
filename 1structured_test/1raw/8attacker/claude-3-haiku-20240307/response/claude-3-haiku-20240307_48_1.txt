To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.80 (80% correct identification).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15% of such attackers).
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
