To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Step 2: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
