To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
