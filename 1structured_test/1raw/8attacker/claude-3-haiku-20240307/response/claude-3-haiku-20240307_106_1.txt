To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a", 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information "b", the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (from information "b", the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4444.
