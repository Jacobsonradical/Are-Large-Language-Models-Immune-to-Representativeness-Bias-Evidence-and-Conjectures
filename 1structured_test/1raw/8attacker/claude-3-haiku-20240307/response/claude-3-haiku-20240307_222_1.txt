To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height given the witness's observation.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when presented with a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Calculations:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (given that 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (given that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (given that the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
4. P(not A) = 0.85 (given that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2857}
