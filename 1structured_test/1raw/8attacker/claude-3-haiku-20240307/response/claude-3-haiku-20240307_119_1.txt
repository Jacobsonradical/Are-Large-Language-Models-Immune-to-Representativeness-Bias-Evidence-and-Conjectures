To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the sample had half shorter and half 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the sample had half shorter and half 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.2927

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2927}
