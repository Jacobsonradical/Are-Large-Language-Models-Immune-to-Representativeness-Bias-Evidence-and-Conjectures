To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not H) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H))

Substituting the given values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4651

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4651.
