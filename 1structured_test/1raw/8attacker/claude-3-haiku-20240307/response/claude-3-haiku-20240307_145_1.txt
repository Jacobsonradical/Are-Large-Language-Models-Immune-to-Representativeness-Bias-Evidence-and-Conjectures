To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population of attackers 185 cm or taller is 15%)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the population of attackers less than 185 cm is 85%)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4545}
