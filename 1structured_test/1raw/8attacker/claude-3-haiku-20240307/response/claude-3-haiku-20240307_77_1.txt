To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)

Step 2: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
