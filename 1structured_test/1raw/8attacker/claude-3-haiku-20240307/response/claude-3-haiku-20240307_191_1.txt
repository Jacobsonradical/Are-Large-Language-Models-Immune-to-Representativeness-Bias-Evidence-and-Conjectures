To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (as 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6667}
