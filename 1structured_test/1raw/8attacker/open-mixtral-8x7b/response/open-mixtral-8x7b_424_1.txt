Let's break down the information given:

a. The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under these conditions is assessed to be correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given this information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement. 

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) = 0.8. However, if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2035

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2035 ≈ 0.5887

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.5887}.
