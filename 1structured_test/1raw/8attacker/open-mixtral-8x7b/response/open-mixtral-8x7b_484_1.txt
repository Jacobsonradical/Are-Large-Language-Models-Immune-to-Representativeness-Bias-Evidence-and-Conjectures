To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) about the attacker's height based on new evidence (data from the witness and general population statistics).

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population statistics.
- P(A'∩B') as the probability that an attacker is neither identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness nor part of the 15% group from the population statistics.

From the problem, we know that P(B) = 0.15 (15%). We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B|A), we need to account for the witness's accuracy:
- If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness identifies them correctly, and a 20% chance they are misidentified as shorter than 185 cm.
- Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now, let's calculate P(B|A'):
- If the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance the witness misidentifies them as 185 cm or taller, and an 80% chance they are correctly identified as shorter than 185 cm.
- Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(A'∩B') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))] * P(A) + 0.17 * (1 - P(A))

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem. However, without knowing the prior probability P(A), we cannot provide a specific numerical estimate for P(A|B). But, we can express the answer in terms of P(A):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [(0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))) * P(A)] / ([0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))] * P(A) + 0.17 * (1 - P(A)))

Please provide the prior probability P(A) to get the exact numerical estimate.
