To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let event A be "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "the observed information". 

From statement (a), we know that when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them as such 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
