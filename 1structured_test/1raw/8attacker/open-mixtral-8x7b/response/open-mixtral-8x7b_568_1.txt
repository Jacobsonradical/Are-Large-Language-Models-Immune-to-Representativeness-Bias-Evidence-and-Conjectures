To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A): probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A): probability of witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 1
