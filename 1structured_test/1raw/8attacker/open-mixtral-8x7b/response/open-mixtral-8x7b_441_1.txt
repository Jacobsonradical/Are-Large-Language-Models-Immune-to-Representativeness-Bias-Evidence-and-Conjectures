To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:

* P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
* P'(B): probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
* P(C): probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller
* P'(C): probability that the witness identifies a random attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:

* P(B|A) = 0.8: the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller
* P(B|A') = 0.2: the witness erred and identified the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker was not 185 cm or taller
* P(C) = 0.15: the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller
* P'(C) = 0.85: 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

Now we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'))

We can simplify this expression using the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(A)))

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(A). However, since the witness's ability to judge a person's height is better than random guessing, we can expect P(A) to be higher than P(C). Thus, a reasonable estimate for P(A) is the average of P(C) and 1:

P(A) = (P(C) + 1) / 2 = (0.15 + 1) / 2 = 0.575

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.575 / (0.8 \* 0.575 + 0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.575 / 0.64 = 0.8984 (rounded to 0.898)

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.898}
