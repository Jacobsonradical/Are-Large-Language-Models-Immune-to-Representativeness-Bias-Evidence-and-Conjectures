To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the reliability of the witness's judgment and the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. 

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We are also given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. 

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We know that:
P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15

We can calculate P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) as follows:
P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller):
P(185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.321

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.321.
