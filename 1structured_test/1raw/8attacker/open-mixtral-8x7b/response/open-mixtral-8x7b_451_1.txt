To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (from statement "a")
- P(H) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, from statement "b")

To find P(W), we need to consider both the true and false positive rates. The true positive rate is P(W|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The false positive rate is the complement of the witness's accuracy rate for people under 185 cm, which is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20. Since only 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, the probability of a false positive is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
