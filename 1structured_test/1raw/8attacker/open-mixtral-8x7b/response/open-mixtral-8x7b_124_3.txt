To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

1. From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (p(h|w) = 0.8, where h is the event that the person is 185 cm or taller, and w is the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller). The witness also errs 20% of the time.

2. Statement (b) gives us the prior probabilities p(h) = 0.15 and p(~h) = 0.85, where ~h is the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm.

3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate p(h|w):

    p(h|w) = p(w|h) * p(h) / p(w)

    We are given p(w|h) = 0.8, and we can calculate p(w|~h) = 1 - p(~w|~h) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people as shorter than 185 cm).

    Then, p(w) = p(w|h) * p(h) + p(w|~h) * p(~h) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

    Finally, p(h|w) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.1765

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1765}
