Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. We know that the population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%).

b. We have a witness who is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we are looking for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we don't know directly. However, since the population is roughly equally split between those below and above 185 cm, we can assume P(A) = 0.5.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the case where the attacker is not.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.5) + (0.2)*(0.5) = 0.6 (the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.5) / (0.6)
