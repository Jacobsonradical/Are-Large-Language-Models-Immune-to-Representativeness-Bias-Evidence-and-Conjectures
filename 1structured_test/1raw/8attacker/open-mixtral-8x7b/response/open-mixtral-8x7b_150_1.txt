Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(error) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability as P(Tall | Witness report), which reads as "the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness report".

P(Tall | Witness report) = P(Witness reports Tall | Attacker is Tall) * P(Attacker is Tall)
+ P(Witness reports Tall | Attacker is not Tall) * P(Attacker is not Tall)

Given that the witness reported the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability as:

P(Tall | Witness report) = P(correct ID) * 0.15 + P(error) * 0.85 = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, given the information provided, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.29}
