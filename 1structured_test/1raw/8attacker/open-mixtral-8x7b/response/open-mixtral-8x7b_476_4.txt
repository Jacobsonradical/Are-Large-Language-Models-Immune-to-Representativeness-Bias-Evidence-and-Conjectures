Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under these conditions is 80% accurate (correct identification) and 20% inaccurate (incorrect identification).

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80% accuracy). Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
