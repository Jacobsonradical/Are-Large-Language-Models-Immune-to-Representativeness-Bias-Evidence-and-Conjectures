To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.5 (since P(A') = 1 - P(A))

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.667 (or 67%).
