Let's analyze the given information:

a. The population is roughly half short (under 185 cm) and half tall (185 cm and taller). However, 85% of attackers are short, and only 15% are tall.
b. A witness identified the attacker as tall (185 cm or taller) with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate.

Now let's calculate the probability:

Let P(T) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, P(T) = 0.15 (15%).

Given the witness's testimony, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. We need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

We don't have the probability of simply observing the witness statement P(W), so let's first find the probability of the witness being wrong:

P(W'|T') = 0.2 (20% chance of witness stating short when the attacker is actually tall)

Now we can find P(W), the probability of the witness statement, by summing over the probabilities of witness statement under both conditions (attacker is tall or short):

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|T') * P(T')
         = (1 - 0.2) * 0.15 + (0.8) * 0.85
         = 0.13 + 0.68
         = 0.81

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)
           = (1 - 0.2) * 0.15 / 0.81
           = 0.12 / 0.81
           â‰ˆ 0.14876

The final answer is: {probability: 0.14876} (rounded to 0.149)
