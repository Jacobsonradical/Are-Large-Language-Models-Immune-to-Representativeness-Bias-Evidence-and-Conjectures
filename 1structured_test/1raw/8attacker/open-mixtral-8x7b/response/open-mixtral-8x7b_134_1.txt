To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the true height is not 185 cm or taller, and only half of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85))

Calculating the above expression:
P(A|B) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
