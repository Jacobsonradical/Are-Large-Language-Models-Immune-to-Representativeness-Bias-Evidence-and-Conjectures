To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To calculate the probability, we need to combine both pieces of information. We are looking for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15, and we know that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.8, from statement "a".

To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) is 0.2, from statement "a", and that P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) is 0.85.

So, P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
