Based on the information provided, let's estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. First, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

From statement (b), the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the true positive rate (when the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller attacker, which is P(B|A)) and the false positive rate (when the witness mistakenly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% for the other 50% of the population). Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the false positive rate is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Now, we can calculate the combined probability P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.5) = 0.14 + 0.05 = 0.19.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.19 â‰ˆ 0.6316

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6316}
