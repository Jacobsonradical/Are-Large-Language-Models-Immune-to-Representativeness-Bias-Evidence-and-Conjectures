To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' | A'): probability of not identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller
- P(B' | A): probability of not identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is 185 cm or taller

From the problem description, we know:
1. P(B) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(B' | A') = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
3. P(A') / [P(A') + P(A)] = 0.5 (population of people shorter than and equal to 185 cm is roughly equal)
4. P(A | attacker is an attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B | A). From the witness's ability to judge height, if a person is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify them as shorter 20% of the time.

P(B | A) = 0.8 and P(B' | A) = 0.2

Now we can find P(A) using:
P(A) / [P(A) + P(A')] = 0.15
P(A) = 0.15 * (1 + P(A') / P(A))

From the distribution of attackers' heights, we have:
P(A' | attacker is an attacker) = 0.85

Now we need to find the relationship between P(A) and P(A' | attacker is an attacker):
P(A) = (1 - P(A' | attacker is an attacker)) * P(attacker is an attacker)
P(A') = P(A' | attacker is an attacker) * P(attacker is an attacker)

Given that the population of people shorter and equal to 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that the probability of a random attacker being shorter or taller than 185 cm is the same as in the general population:
P(attacker is an attacker | shorter than or equal to 185 cm) = P(attacker is an attacker | taller than 185 cm)

We know that P(A' | attacker is an attacker) = 0.85, so:
P(A | attacker is an attacker) = 1 - P(A' | attacker is an attacker) = 0.15

Now we can use these probabilities to find the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A | B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.8
P(A | B) = P(A)

Now we need to find P(A):

P(A) = 0.15 * (1 + P(A') / P(A))
P(A') = 0.85 * P(attacker is an attacker)
P(A') = 0.85 * [P(attacker is an attacker | shorter than or equal to 185 cm) * P(shorter than or equal to 185 cm) + P(attacker is an attacker | taller than 185 cm) * P(taller than 185 cm)]
P(A') = 0.85 * [0.5 * (1 - P(A | attacker is an attacker)) + 0.5 * P(A | attacker is an attacker)]
P(A') = 0.85 * [0.5 * 0.85 + 0.5 * 0.15]
P(A') = 0.73875

Now we can find P(A):
P(A) = 0.15 * (1 + P(A') / P(A))
P(A) - 0.15 * P(A') / P(A) = 0.15
P(A)^2 - 0.15 * P(A') = 0.15 * P(A)
P(A)^2 - 0.15 * 0.73875 = 0.15 * P(A)
P(A)^2 - 0.1108125 = 0.15 * P(A)
P(A)^2 - 0.15 * P(A) - 0.1108125 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for P(A):

Δ = (0.15)^2 + 4 * (-0.1108125)
Δ = 0.0225 + (-0.44325)
Δ = -0.42075

Since Δ < 0, there is no real solution for P(A). However, we can still estimate P(A) using the quadratic formula:

P(A) = (-b + sqrt(Δ)) / 2a

Given that a = 1, b = -0.15, and Δ is negative, we can use the complex conjugate root theorem:

P(A) = (-b + sqrt(Δ)) / 2a = (-(-0.15) + 0i) / 2
P(A) ≈ 0.075 + 0i

However, probabilities cannot be complex numbers. The reason for this is that the assumption of the probability of a random attacker being shorter or taller than 185 cm is the same as in the general population is not valid. This assumption leads to an incorrect conclusion, which implies that the witness's information does not provide us with enough information to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

Instead, we can use the information about the distribution of attackers' heights and assume that the witness is equally likely to incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm:

P(B' | A) = P(B | A') = 0.5

Now we can calculate:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
0.8 = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.8
P(A) = 1

This means that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but this is an overestimation because it assumes that the witness's incorrect identification is equally likely for both cases.

Given all these considerations and approximations, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.8, provided in decimal form since the witness's information is not enough to estimate a probability with a solid foundation}
