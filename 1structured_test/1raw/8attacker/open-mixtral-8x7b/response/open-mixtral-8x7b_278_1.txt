To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(185+ | identified as 185+) = P(identified as 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(identified as 1
