To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 34.5%.
