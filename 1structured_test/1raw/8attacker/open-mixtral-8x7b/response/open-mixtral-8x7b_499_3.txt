To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

(Probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person) * (Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
+ (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller) * (Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.
