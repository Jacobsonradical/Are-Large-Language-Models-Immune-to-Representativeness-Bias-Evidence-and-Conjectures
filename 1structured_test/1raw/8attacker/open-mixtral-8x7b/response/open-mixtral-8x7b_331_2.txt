To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote the probability we want to estimate as P(A), where A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such can be calculated as:

P(A|W) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Thus, the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's statement, is:

P(A) = 0.15

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
