Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness data suggests that, out of all cases, the witness correctly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. This information can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The key question here is: Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, what is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller?

To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, so we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. And since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
