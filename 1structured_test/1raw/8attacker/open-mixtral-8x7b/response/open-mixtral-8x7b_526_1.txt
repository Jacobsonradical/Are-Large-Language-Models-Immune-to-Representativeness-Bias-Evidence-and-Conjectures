To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%)
- P(~E): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is NOT actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%)
- P(C): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

First, calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ~A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now, calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(B|A) = 0.8

To summarize,

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))
P(B|A) = 0.8

We need to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, we can approximate P(A) as follows:

P(A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, substitute P(A) into the equation for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.16)
= 0.12 / 0.28
= 0.42857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.43 (43%).
