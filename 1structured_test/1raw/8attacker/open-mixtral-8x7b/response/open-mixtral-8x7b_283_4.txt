Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% for such heights and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

We know the following probabilities from the given information:
- P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(B|¬A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (¬A represents the opposite event of A, i.e., the attacker is below 185 cm)
- P(A): Probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (from point a)
- P(¬A): Probability of a random attacker being below 185 cm = 0.5 (from point a)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
