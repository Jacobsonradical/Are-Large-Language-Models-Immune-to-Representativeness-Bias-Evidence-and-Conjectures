Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the statement (b), we are given that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Hence, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) and P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

From statement (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15 and therefore, P(A') = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
= 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places).

Formatted answer:
{probability: 0.4137931}
