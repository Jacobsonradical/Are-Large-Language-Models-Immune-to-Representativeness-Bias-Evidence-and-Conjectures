Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From statement (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

From statement (b), the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time, which means that P(not B|A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B'|A) = 0.2, where B' denotes the complement of B.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have P(B|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(B).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We know that:
- P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(B' and A) = P(not B|A) * P(A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

The complement of the event (B and not A) is (B' and A) or (B' and not A), so:

P(B' and not A) = P(B' and A) + P(B' and not A) = 0.03 + P(B' and not A)

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that:

P(not A) ≈ 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can find the sum of probabilities for all events related to not A:

P(B' and not A) + P(B and not A) = P(not A)

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B and not A) as:

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find the total probability for the event B:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
