Given the information in (a), the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, this information is not enough to estimate the overall probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, since we also need to take into account the base rates of attackers' heights in the population, which is given in (b).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (from (a)), and P(A) = 0.15 (from (b)), since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To compute P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the case where they are not. Let C denote the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Then P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|C) \* P(C), and we are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15, so we just need to find P(B|C) and P(C).

Since 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, we have P(C) = 0.85. To find P(B|C), we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, so P(B|C) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Putting it all together, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.68)
= 0.15 / 0.83
= 0.1807 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1807.
