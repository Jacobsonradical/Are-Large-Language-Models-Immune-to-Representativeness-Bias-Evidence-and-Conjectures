Let's analyze the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, is 0.8.

b. Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This implies that the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
- The attacker is 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which has a probability of P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
