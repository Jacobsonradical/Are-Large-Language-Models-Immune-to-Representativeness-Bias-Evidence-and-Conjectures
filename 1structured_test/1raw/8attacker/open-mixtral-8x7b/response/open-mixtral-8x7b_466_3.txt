To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Since there are roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, we can assume that the witness's accuracy is the same for both groups. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 (from statement "a")
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from statement "b")

To calculate P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:
P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

To find P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller), we can use the complement of the witness's accuracy for the under 185 cm group:
P(Witness identified NOT 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

Given the witness's 80% accuracy for the 185 cm or taller group, we can assume a similar error rate for the under 185 cm group. Therefore, P(Witness identified NOT 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) ≈ 1 - 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.34

Now, we can calculate P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller):
P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.34 * 0.85 ≈ 0.12 + 0.287 = 0.407

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.407 ≈ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
