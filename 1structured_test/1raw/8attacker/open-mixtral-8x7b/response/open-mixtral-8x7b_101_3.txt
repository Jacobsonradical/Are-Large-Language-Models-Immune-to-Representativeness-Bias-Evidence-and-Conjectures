Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, when it comes to attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

Now, we have a witness who has a success rate of 80% when judging a person's height and an error rate of 20%. 

Given these factors, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
2. We know the witness is correct 80% of the time.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.
4. Therefore, we multiply the prior probability (15%) by the witness's accuracy (80%) and the resulting probability is 0.12 or 12%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is: {probability: 0.12}
