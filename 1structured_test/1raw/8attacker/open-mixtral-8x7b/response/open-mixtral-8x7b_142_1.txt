Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance the witness would have identified the attacker correctly and a 20% chance they would have misidentified a shorter attacker.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the distribution of attackers:

85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't know if the witness's identification is correct or not, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller using both pieces of information and then multiply them:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Let's solve for P(attacker is 185 cm or taller):

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.15 / 0.34 = 0.4412 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4412 or 44.12%.
