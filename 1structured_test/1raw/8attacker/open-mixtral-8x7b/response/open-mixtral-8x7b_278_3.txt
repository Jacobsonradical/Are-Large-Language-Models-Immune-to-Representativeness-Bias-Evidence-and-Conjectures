Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This could suggest that tall people are less likely to be attackers, but it's also possible that the sample size of attackers is too small to accurately reflect the general population.

Next, let's consider the reliability of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, this calculation requires making some assumptions, such as the reliability of the witness being independent of the general population statistics.

Assuming independence, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
/ P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

We can calculate:
P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.321

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.321.
