Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% for such heights.

Given these two points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

2. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and attackers are evenly distributed in height, we can estimate this probability to be around 7.5% (0.15 / 2) since there are more short attackers.

3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall.

   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
         = 0.8 * 0.075 + 0.2 * 0.925
         = 0.06 + 0.185
         = 0.245

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.075 / 0.245
       = 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
