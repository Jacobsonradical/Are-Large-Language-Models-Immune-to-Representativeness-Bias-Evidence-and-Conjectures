Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker correctly and the probability of them making an error when identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm.

The witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time, so the probability of them correctly identifying an attacker of this height is 0.8 (80%). The witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not, so the probability of them making this error for an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%).

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified an 185 cm or taller attacker, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of this height:

0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%)

Similarly, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm multiplied by the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a shorter person:

0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Therefore, given the information and the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
