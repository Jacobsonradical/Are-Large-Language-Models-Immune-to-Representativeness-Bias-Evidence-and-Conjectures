Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is given as 80%, or 0.8.

Next, we need to consider the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, and that the witness correctly identifies them as such, is the product of these two probabilities: 0.8 (witness accuracy) times 0.15 (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).

This gives us a final probability of approximately 0.12, or 12%. So, there's roughly a 12% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
