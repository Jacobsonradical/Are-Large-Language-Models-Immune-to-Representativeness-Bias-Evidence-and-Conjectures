To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such with 80% probability (P(B|A) = 0.8) and erroneously identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (P(A)) and 85% are not (P(not A)).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
