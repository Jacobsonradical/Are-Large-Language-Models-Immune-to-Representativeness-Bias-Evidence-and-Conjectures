Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (0.8 probability) and errs 20% of the time (0.2 probability).

Given that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at/above 185 cm, we can estimate the probability that a person is at/above 185 cm as 0.5.

However, we're interested in the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. This is a case of posterior probability, which requires the use of Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm.

P(A) = 0.5 (the prior probability)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying an attacker at/above 185 cm)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability of incorrectly identifying an attacker under 185 cm as at/above 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm given that the witness identified them as such.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1

P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
