Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(error | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
/ P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

The event "witness identified as 185 cm or taller" can be broken down into two mutually exclusive events:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller.

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller and attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller and attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the desired probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
= 0.8

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
