To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller (P(tall|tall)) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (P(tall|short)) is 0.2.

2. The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 1
