To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We know that P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(Witness), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short)

We know that P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 and P(Tall) = 0.15

We know that P(Witness | Short) = 1 - P(Witness | Tall) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm)

We know that P(Short) = 1 - P(Tall) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(Witness):

P(Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall | Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 1.19

However, this result is greater than 1, which indicates an error in our calculation or inconsistency in the given information. Given the provided information, we cannot accurately estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
