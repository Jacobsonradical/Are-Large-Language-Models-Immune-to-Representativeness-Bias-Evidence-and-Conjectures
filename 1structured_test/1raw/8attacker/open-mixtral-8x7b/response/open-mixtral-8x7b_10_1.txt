To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. However, this statement alone does not account for the fact that most attackers are actually under 185 cm (based on statement "b").

To account for both pieces of information, let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height is 0.8 (from statement "a").
2. The attacker is under 185 cm. In this case, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (from statement "a"). However, given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (from statement "b"), this scenario is actually more likely. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

To find the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can add the probabilities from both scenarios:

0.8 (attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 0.03 (attacker is under 185 cm but misidentified) = 0.83

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.83}
