To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both (a) and (b).

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- Correctly identified height 80% of the time
- Erred in 20% of the cases

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights:
- 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm
- Only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:
- P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

We can also calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller:
- P(Incorrectly identified | Under 185 cm) = 0.2

Given the roughly equal size of both populations, the overall probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. Thus, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(185 cm or taller, correctly identified) = P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) x P(185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 x 0.15
= 0.12

Similarly, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Under 185 cm, incorrectly identified) = P(Incorrectly identified | Under 185 cm) x P(Under 185 cm)
= 0.2 x 0.85
= 0.17

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(185 cm or taller, correctly identified) / (P(185 cm or taller, correctly identified) + P(Under 185 cm, incorrectly identified))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.4138 (rounded to 0.41)

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.41}.
