Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.
3. So, if we were to assume that the witness's estimation was accurate, we would overestimate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller due to the higher prevalence of shorter attackers.
4. To calculate the actual probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) where A is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. Plugging in the given values: P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct identification), and P(B) = 0.15*(0.8) + 0.85*(1-0.8) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.37 (total probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
6. Now we can calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.324

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.324.
