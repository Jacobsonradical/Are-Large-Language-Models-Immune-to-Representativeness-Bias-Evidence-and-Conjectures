To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In our case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally divided in height)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is the complementary probability)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the denominator:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
= 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.
