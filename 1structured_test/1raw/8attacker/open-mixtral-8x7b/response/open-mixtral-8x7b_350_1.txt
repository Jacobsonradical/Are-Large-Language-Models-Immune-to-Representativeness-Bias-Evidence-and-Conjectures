Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, when it comes to attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

However, we also have information about a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness has an 80% success rate in judging height under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability. We can do this by calculating the probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the witness being correct is 0.8, as stated. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the general population statistics, is 0.15 (15%). 

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B), we need to consider the two possible outcomes for the witness: either identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, or making an error and identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2, as stated. Given that the population is roughly equally split, the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being under 185 cm is also 0.5 (50%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is therefore 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identification scenarios:

P(B) = P(witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller attacker) + P(witness incorrectly identifies shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.085
P(B) = 0.205

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.585

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.585 (58.5%).
