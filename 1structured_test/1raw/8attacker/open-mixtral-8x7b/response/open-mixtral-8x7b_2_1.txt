To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Without knowing any other information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Since the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
