Based on the information provided, let's estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that the population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population. On the other hand, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is assessed to be 80% accurate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where
A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
P(A) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller,
P(B | A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, and
P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally divided),
P(B | A) = 0.8 (the witness is 80% accurate when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller), and
P(B | not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

We need to calculate P(B) to apply Bayes' theorem. We can do this by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.6667, or approximately 67%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 67%.
