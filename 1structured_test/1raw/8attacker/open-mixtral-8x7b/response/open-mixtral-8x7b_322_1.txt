Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate when the sample consists of equal numbers of short and tall people. This means that, on average, the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller under the given circumstances.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Using the information from part a, we know that P(T) = 0.15 since only 15% of attackers are this tall. 

Now, we want to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is denoted as P(Correct ID | T). From part b, we know that this probability is 0.8 (80% success rate).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute:

P(T | Correct ID) = P(Correct ID | T) * P(T) / P(Correct ID)

To find P(Correct ID), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Correct ID) = P(Correct ID | T) * P(T) + P(Correct ID | ~T) * P(~T)

Here, ~T denotes the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(~T) = 0.85 based on part a. We don't have specific information about the witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but given the roughly equal population sizes, let's assume the error rate is symmetric, i.e., the witness is wrong 20% of the time in this case as well. This means P(Correct ID | ~T) = 0.8 and P(~Correct ID | ~T) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(Correct ID):

P(Correct ID) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the correct identification by the witness:

P(T | Correct ID) = P(Correct ID | T) * P(T) / P(Correct ID) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.15 or 15%.
