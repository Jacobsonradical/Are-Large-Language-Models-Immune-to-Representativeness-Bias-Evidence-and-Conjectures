To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of cases. Since there are roughly equal numbers of people shorter and taller than 185 cm, this means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are actually that tall.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the two probabilities together. That is, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8) multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.15).

probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
