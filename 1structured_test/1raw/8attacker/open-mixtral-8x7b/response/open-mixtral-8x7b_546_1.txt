To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller given the distribution of attackers' heights)
P(!A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm given the distribution of attackers' heights)

Now, to find P(B|!A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller:

P(B|!A) = 1 - P(B^c|!A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was under 185 cm)

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [(P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|!A) * P(!A))]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.273

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.273}
