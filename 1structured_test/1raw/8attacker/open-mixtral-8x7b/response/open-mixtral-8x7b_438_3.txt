To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

First, let's consider the general population, where 50% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 50% are 185 cm or taller (as stated in the first piece of information, "a"). However, we know that the attackers are not representative of the general population, with 85% being people under 185 cm and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's incorporate the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information about the attackers' height distribution and the witness's accuracy. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy in doing so is 80%, we can estimate the probability as:

Probability = 0.15 (population proportion of people 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) + 0 (population proportion of people under 185 cm) * 0.2 (witness error rate)

Probability = 0.12 + 0

probability: 0.12 (12%)
