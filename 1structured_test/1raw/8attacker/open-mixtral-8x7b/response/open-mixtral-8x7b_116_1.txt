To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, meaning the witness incorrectly identified someone as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A'), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
= 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
