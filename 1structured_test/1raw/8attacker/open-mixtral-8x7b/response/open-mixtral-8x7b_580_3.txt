To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).

To find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B). Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is approximately 34.5%.
