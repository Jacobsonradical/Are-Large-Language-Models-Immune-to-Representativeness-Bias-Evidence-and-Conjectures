Let's reason through this problem:

We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information suggests that there are more attackers coming from the shorter population group.

Now, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate when the sample contains equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm.

Let's calculate the probability:

There are two possible scenarios:
1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given the witness's 80% success rate, the probability of the first scenario is 0.8, while the probability of the second scenario is 0.2.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
probability: 0.8
