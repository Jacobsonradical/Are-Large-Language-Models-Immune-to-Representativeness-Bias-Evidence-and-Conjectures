Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification:

P(Tall | Witness) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a tall person) + 0.2 (probability of misidentifying a short person as tall)
= 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.5 (since half the sample are short)
= 0.9

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the attacker statistics:

P(Tall) = 0.15 (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both pieces of information:

P(Tall | Witness, Attacker stats) = P(Tall | Witness) * P(Tall) / P(Witness | Tall)

We already have P(Tall | Witness) and P(Tall). To find P(Witness | Tall), we consider that the witness will always identify a tall attacker as tall, so P(Witness | Tall) = 1.

Therefore,
P(Tall | Witness, Attacker stats) = 0.9 * 0.15 / 1
= 0.135

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.135 (or 13.5%).
