Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being actually shorter than 185 cm given the same witness identification is 0.2.

b. Of the attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This implies that the probability of a randomly selected attacker being under 185 cm is 0.85, and the probability of a randomly selected attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

However, the information about the attacker being chosen from the population where 50% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 50% are 185 cm or taller is not relevant to the current scenario, because the attacker is not a randomly selected person from the population, but rather one of the two groups defined by the witness's identification.

Therefore, using the information from a), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given the witness identification).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
