To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Given a person who is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify the height 80% of the time and erroneously identify them as shorter 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

where:

* P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
* P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm, which is 85%.
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
* P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 50% (since the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.50 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.425)
= 0.12 / 0.545
= 0.22

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.22.
