Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy and a 20% error rate.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.2818 or 28.18%.
