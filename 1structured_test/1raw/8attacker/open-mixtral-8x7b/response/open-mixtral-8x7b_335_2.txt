Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population: since it's roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller, we can assume a 50-50 split.

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, this implies that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population. However, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is not in line with the prior probability (the 50-50 split).

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

So, if we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the prior probability and the witness's ability to judge height. This kind of calculation is known as Bayesian inference.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, and P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.

We know that P(A) = 0.5 (from the prior probability) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's height).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Here, ¬A denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the person is shorter than 185 cm.

We also know that P(¬A) = 0.5, and since the witness errs 20% of the time in judging a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, we have P(W|¬A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|W) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|W) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.
