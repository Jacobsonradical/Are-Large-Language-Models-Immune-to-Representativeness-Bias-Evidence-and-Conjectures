To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, which is 0.8 (80%).

Next, we calculate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller and then being correctly identified as such by the witness. This is equal to the product of the probability of being 185 cm or taller and the probability of being correctly identified, which is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Now, we consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is the product of the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (50%) * 0.2 (20%) = 0.1 or 10%.

To find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we add the two probabilities calculated above, giving us 12% + 10% = 22%.

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.22}
