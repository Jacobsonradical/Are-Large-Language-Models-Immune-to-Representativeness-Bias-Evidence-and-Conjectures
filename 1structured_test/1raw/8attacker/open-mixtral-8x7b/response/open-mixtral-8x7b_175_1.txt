To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness's testimony provides some evidence for the attacker being 185 cm or taller, but there is still some uncertainty.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. While the population is roughly equally split between people shorter than 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller, only 15% of attackers are in the latter category. This suggests that even though the witness may have identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, it is still more likely that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the witness's testimony with the distribution of attackers' heights. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and let W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given P(W|A) = 0.8, and since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we have P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2. We are also given that the population is roughly equally split between people shorter than 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller, so we have P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Putting it all together, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (12%).
