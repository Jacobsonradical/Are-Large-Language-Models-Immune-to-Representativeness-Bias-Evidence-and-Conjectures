To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified people taller than or equal to 185 cm 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, but the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here,
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
