Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This suggests that even though there are many people of this height, they are less likely to be attackers.

Next, let's consider the reliability of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time. This means that there is a chance that the witness could be wrong about the attacker's height.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
P(~B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), P(B) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), and P(B) + P(~B) = 1 (the witness's identification is always either correct or incorrect).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know all the values except for P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and assuming that the witness's error is random, we can estimate this value as the overall error rate, or 20%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.
