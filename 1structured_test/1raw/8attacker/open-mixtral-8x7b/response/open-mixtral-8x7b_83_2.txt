Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate for such identifications.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time, so the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's identification is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also need to consider the base rate of tall attackers, which is 15%. The witness identification does not provide any new information about the attacker's height if the base rate is already 80% or 100%. In this case, the base rate is much lower (15%). Therefore, the witness identification should have a more significant impact on our estimate.

Formally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's identification):

P(Tall | Identified Tall) = [P(Identified Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Identified Tall)

We know P(Identified Tall | Tall) = 0.8, P(Tall) = 0.15, and P(Identified Tall) is a normalization factor that we can calculate as follows:

P(Identified Tall) = P(Identified Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Identified Tall | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

We can calculate P(Identified Tall | Not Tall) using the witness's error rate of 20%:

P(Identified Tall | Not Tall) = 1 - P(Identified Short | Not Tall) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

And we know P(Not Tall) = 1 - P(Tall) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(Identified Tall):

P(Identified Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(Tall | Identified Tall):

P(Tall | Identified Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
