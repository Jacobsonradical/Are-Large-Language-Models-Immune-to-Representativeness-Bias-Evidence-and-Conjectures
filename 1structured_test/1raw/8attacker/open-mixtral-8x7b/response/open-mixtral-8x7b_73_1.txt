Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's testimony.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B).

We are told that P(B|A) (the probability of correctly identifying an attacker of 185 cm or taller) is 0.8, and P(A) (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we need to consider both correct identifications and errors. The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of 185 cm or taller is 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41.
