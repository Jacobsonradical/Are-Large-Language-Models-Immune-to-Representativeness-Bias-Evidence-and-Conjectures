Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that being 185 cm or taller might be somewhat atypical for this particular group of people (attackers).

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to account for both the base rate of such attackers in the population and the accuracy of the witness. This type of calculation is known as a base rate fallacy adjustment.

The formula for this is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and B represents "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
