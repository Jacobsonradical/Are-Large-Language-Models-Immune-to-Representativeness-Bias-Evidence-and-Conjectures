Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [ P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) ] / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (given), and P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as follows:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [ (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 ] = 0.6667, or approximately 67%

{probability: 0.67}
