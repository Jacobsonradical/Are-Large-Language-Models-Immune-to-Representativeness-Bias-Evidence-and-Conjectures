Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under these conditions is assessed to be correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability, where:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness errs in identifying height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are below 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38%)

{probability: 0.4138}
