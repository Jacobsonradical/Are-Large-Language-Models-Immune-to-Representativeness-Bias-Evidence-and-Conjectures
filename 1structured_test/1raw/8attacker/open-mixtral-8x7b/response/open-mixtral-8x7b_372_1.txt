To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and from statement "b", P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller), we can use the complement of the witness's accuracy: P(Witness identified as UNDER 185 cm | Attacker is UNDER 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Format answer: {probability: 0.41}
