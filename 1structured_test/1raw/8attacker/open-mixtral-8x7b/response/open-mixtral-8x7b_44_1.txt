To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(not A) = 0.85

To find P(B|not A), we need to consider the witness's error rate. If the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, there is a 20% chance that the witness will still identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now we can find P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 = 0.34

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.34.
