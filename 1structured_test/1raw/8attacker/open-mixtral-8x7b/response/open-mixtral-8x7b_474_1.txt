Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for such heights.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
