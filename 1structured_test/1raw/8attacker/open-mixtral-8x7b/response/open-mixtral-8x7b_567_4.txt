Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, this probability is 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is actually not 185 cm or taller (but is shorter than 185 cm). The witness errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, this probability is 0.2.

Now, we know from point "a" that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We have already calculated the probabilities on the right side:
P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
