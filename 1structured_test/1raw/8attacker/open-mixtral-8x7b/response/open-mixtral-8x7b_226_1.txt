To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We can calculate P(A|B) by using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the witness is correct and where the witness is incorrect:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since witness errs 20% of the time for people under 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Hence, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.064 = 0.864

Now, we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.864 â‰ˆ 0.139

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.139.
