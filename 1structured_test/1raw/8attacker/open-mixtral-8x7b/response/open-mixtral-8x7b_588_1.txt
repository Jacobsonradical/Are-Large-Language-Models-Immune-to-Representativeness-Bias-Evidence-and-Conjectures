Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into two parts:

Part 1: The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that even though the population is evenly split, the attackers are not, and taller people are less likely to be attackers.

Part 2: A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate when the sample has equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. This means that the witness is more likely to be correct when identifying taller people, as their error rate is only 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let's define the following events:
T: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness correctly identified that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we have P(T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(W|T) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as follows:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|T') * P(T')

where T' represents the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, and P(T') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm). The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(W|T') = 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345
