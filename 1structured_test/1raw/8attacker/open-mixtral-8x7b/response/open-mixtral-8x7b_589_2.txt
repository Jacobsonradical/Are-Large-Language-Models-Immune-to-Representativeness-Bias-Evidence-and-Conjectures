Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they actually are, and denote this probability as p(correct identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) or p(CI | A185).

According to point b, the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so:

p(CI | A185) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they are not, and denote this probability as p(incorrect identification | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) or p(II | A<185).

Since there is a roughly equal population of people under and over 185 cm tall, and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, it follows that:

p(II | A<185) = 0.2

Now, we need to calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to multiply the probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A185) and the witness correctly identifying the height (CI) by the corresponding conditional probability, and sum this value over both scenarios (attacker being 185 cm or taller, and attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

p(CI) = p(CI | A185) * p(A185) + p(CI | A<185) * p(A<185)

However, we don't have information about the actual probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (p(A185)) or shorter than 185 cm (p(A<185)). Based on the given information, we can only calculate the probabilities conditioned on the attacker's height.

We do know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so we can use this information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

probability: 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, based on the given information).
