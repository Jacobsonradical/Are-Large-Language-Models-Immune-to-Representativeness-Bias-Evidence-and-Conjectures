Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, it's a 50/50 chance that a randomly selected person is one or the other. However, we don't have a random sample; instead, we have a witness identification.

The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time. So, if the actual probability was 50%, the witness would be expected to identify a 185 cm or taller attacker with an accuracy of 80%, resulting in:

0.5 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.6

But this is a simplification because the witness doesn't represent a random sample. Instead, the witness's error rate increases the chance of identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller.

Let E be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. Then, the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) can be calculated as:

P(A) = P(A and Witness correct) + P(A and Witness incorrect)
P(A) = 0.5 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.5) * E

We know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time:

P(Witness incorrect) = (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.5) = 0.1

Since there are two groups of people, and the witness is equally likely to be incorrect about either group, the probability of the witness being incorrect about people under 185 cm is also 0.1:

P(Witness incorrect for people under 185 cm) = 0.1

Therefore, the probability E can be calculated as:

E = P(Attacker under 185 cm and Witness incorrect) = 0.1

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.5 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.5) * 0.1
P(A) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.1
P(A) = 0.4 + 0.05

{probability: 0.45}
