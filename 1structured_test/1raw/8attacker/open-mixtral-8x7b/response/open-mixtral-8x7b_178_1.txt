To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both (a) and (b).

First, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. However, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we need to account for both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of taller attackers.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Taller | Witness's report) = P(Witness's report | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness's report)

P(Witness's report) = P(Witness's report | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness's report | Not Taller) * P(Not Taller)

P(Witness's report | Taller) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

P(Taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness's report | Not Taller) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

P(Not Taller) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(Taller | Witness's report) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.346

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.346 (34.6%).
