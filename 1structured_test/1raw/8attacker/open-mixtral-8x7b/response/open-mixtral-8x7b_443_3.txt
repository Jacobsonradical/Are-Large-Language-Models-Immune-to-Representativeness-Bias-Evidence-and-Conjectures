To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not. Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the base rate for people being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

Next, we consider the distribution of attackers' heights, with 85% being people under 185 cm and only 15% being 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's report.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and O represent the witness observing the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O)

We are interested in finding P(A|O), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's observation.

P(O|A) is the probability of the witness observing the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (the witness's 80% accuracy rate).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% based on the distribution of attackers' heights).

To find P(O), we need to consider the witness's observations for both cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

P(O) = P(O|A) * P(A) + P(O|¬A) * P(¬A)

Here, P(¬A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85% based on the distribution of attackers' heights).

P(O|¬A) is the probability of the witness observing the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (the witness's 20% error rate).

Now we can calculate P(O):

P(O) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

With all the probabilities calculated, we can now calculate the posterior probability P(A|O):

P(A|O) = P(O|A) * P(A) / P(O) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
