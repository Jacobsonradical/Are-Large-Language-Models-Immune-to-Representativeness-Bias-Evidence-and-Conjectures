Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that the population has roughly an equal number of people below and above 185 cm.
2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error)
- P(A) = 0.5 (even population distribution)
- P(not A) = 0.5

Plugging in these values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
