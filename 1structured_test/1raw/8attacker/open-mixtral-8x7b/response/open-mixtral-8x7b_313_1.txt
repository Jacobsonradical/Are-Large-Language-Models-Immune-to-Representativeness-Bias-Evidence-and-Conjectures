Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from part a).
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% (from part a).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% (the error rate).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.397

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.397 (39.7%).
