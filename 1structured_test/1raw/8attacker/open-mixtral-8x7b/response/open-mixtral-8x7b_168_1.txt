To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness Report)

We want to find P(Taller | Witness Report), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness report.

We are given P(Witness Report | Taller) = 0.8 (from statement "a") and P(Taller) = 0.15 (from statement "b").

To find P(Witness Report), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is taller than 185 cm and where the attacker is shorter than 1
